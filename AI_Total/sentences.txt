the authors investigate how licensing influences innovation patterns, industry costs, and market structure.
they find that trade in technology information can have both positive and negative effects.
licensing can boost innovation when industry cost differences are minimal but may hinder innovation and result in higher market prices when costs vary significantly.
additionally, licensing can decrease innovation in concentrated industries while promoting it in unconcentrated ones.
it's worth noting that licensing agreements may include royalty rates lower than the licensor's cost advantage.
the exact mechanism through which pretreatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues enhances the outcome of assisted reproductive technology (art) remains unclear and can only be speculated upon.
however, a reasonable postulation is that suppressing ovarian function before art could improve outcomes by addressing endometrial abnormalities associated with endometriosis, thus enhancing receptivity.
evidence supporting this hypothesis includes the disappearance of endometrial abnormalities in women with endometriosis following ovarian suppression with oral contraceptives or gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues.
it is important to note that while a reduction in nerve bundles has been observed in women using oral contraceptives, this does not necessarily indicate a complete return to normal endometrial conditions once oral contraceptive use is discontinued and the endometrium begins to proliferate again.
in order to overcome the challenges mentioned above and align with the requirements of the 5g system, a significant overhaul of the cellular architecture is essential.
research indicates that a vast majority of wireless users, approximately 80 percent, are indoors most of the time, with only 20 percent of their time spent outdoors.
the traditional cellular setup typically features an outdoor base station (bs) positioned at the center of a cell, serving both indoor and outdoor mobile users.
however, this arrangement results in substantial signal attenuation when indoor users communicate with the outdoor bs through building walls.
this high penetration loss severely impacts the data rate, spectral efficiency, and energy efficiency of wireless transmissions.
in order to create more environmentally friendly wireless communication systems, it is crucial that the design of 5g wireless systems prioritizes minimizing energy consumption.
global wireless system operators should focus on reducing energy usage to lower co2 emissions.
utilizing indoor communication technologies shows promise in achieving improved energy efficiency due to the advantageous channel conditions it provides for transmitter and receiver connections.
separating indoor and outdoor traffic can alleviate pressure on macrocell base stations, allowing for lower-power transmissions and ultimately leading to substantial energy savings.
additionally, energy-efficient solutions such as visible light communication (vlc) and millimeter-wave technologies are viable options for deployment in 5g systems.
for instance, vlc systems use significantly less energy than their rf-based counterparts when transmitting high-density data.
to ensure a thorough and unbiased evaluation of 5g wireless systems, it is crucial to consider a wide range of performance metrics.
these metrics encompass spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, latency, reliability, user fairness, quality of service (qos), implementation complexity, and more.
therefore, it is imperative to establish a comprehensive framework for assessing the performance of 5g wireless systems that incorporates a diverse set of performance metrics from various viewpoints.
it is essential to strike a balance among all these metrics, necessitating the use of sophisticated joint optimization algorithms and extensive simulation durations.
one of the major technical challenges in the development of massive mimo systems revolves around the complexity of signal processing.
due to the lengthy transmit and receive signals, search algorithms must meticulously navigate through numerous symbol permutations.
existing research often views massive mimo as a detection problem driven by the popular maximum likelihood (ml) criterion.
however, current detection algorithms assume perfect channel estimations, which can be impractical given the vast channel matrix size and the multitude of channels needing tracking.
an effective solution proposed for this issue involves applying the spatial modulation (sm) concept to massive mimo systems.
under this approach, each antenna's spatial signature must be unique from the receiver's perspective, as data is embedded in the selection of active transmit antennas within the array.
consequently, precise channel estimation may not be necessary, as long as it is sufficient to differentiate between each transmit antenna.
certain short-range communication technologies like wifi, femtocell, visible light communication (vlc), and millimeter-wave communication technologies are regarded as potential solutions to offer indoor users high-quality, high-data-rate services.
these technologies also help alleviate the strain on outdoor base stations.
additionally, we have reviewed several crucial technologies that could be integrated into 5g wireless systems to meet the anticipated performance criteria.
these include cognitive radio networks, spatial modulation (sm), multimode femtocells (mfemtocells), vlc, and eco-friendly communication methods, while also outlining associated technical hurdles.
since the mid-20th century, scholars have extensively delved into the various potential uses of intelligent methods across the medical spectrum.
the introduction of ai technology in surgical practices was early on spearheaded by gunn in 1976, as he probed the viability of utilizing computer analysis for diagnosing acute abdominal distress.
the past twenty years, conversely, have witnessed a notable upsurge in the enthusiasm surrounding ai advancements within the medical domain.
numerous ai techniques exist that can effectively address a range of clinical issues.
despite initial optimism, the adoption of medical ai technology has not been wholehearted.
one contributing factor is clinicians' reservations about incorporating technology into decision-making processes.
interestingly, while clinicians readily accept data from auto-analyzers and mri images, there is hesitation when it comes to embracing ai technology.
researchers in the field bear the responsibility of providing tangible proof of the practical effectiveness of these techniques.
it is imperative to conduct more randomized controlled studies to establish the efficacy of ai systems in the medical domain.
for many years, the presence of chaos was deemed undesirable by many, with most experimenters actively avoiding its characteristics.
apart from their high sensitivity to initial conditions, chaotic systems possess two significant attributes.
firstly, there exists an infinite number of unstable periodic orbits within the underlying chaotic set.
essentially, the structure of a chaotic attractor comprises a multitude of unstable periodic orbits.
secondly, the dynamics within the chaotic attractor are ergodic, signifying that the system systematically explores the vicinity of every point within each of the unstable periodic orbits present within the chaotic attractor during its temporal evolution.
due to the inherent complexity and experimental imperfections of our system, it is reasonable to acknowledge that complete knowledge of its dynamics is unlikely.
in such cases, it is more practical to focus on seeking solutions within the system.
while equations may exist, their utility is limited due to the system's sensitivity to perturbations.
solutions can be derived by analyzing a time series of a key variable.
to determine the most appropriate perturbation, a learning phase is required, during which the impact of external controls on the system dynamics is experimentally tested.
this perturbation could target a control parameter or a state variable.
for the former, adjustments are made to available control parameters, while for the latter, a feedback loop is established based on a relevant state variable of the system.
in the vast array of potential applications for controlling chaotic behavior, we focus on two areas that have gained significant interest within the scientific community in recent years.
specifically, we look at utilizing chaotic behavior for communication and synchronizing chaotic systems for different communication strategies.
in the first scenario, a chaotic system is intentionally disturbed to generate a specific chaotic path that conveys a desired message.
in the second scenario, chaos synchronization is harnessed to establish communication between a sender and receiver, enabling synchronization between the two parties.
another significant application of controlling chaotic behavior is synchronizing chaotic systems.
when two identical chaotic systems with different initial conditions are considered, their critical sensitivity to initial conditions causes their difference to exponentially increase over time, leading to unsynchronized evolution.
by transmitting the appropriate signal from one system to the other, this difference can be reduced to zero, resulting in both systems entering a synchronized state where their chaotic motion progresses in harmony over time.
this concept gained considerable attention in the early part of the decade.
in this report, we outline a potential use of chaos synchronization in securing signal transmission between a message sender and receiver across a communication channel.
the report is structured as follows: section 2 introduces the ogy method through examples of one-dimensional and two-dimensional mappings.
it then explores the pole placement technique for controlling higher-dimensional scenarios.
additionally, in section 3, various chaos control strategies are discussed, with a focus on the adaptive approach for delayed dynamical systems, which acts as a bridge between concentrated and spatially extended systems.
section 4 delves into the targeting problem, demonstrating how the ogy criterion and adaptivity can steer chaotic trajectories towards specific targets and even control fractal basin boundaries.
moreover, section 5 addresses stabilizing desired chaotic trajectories and highlights applications such as communication with chaos and communication via chaos synchronization.
finally, section 6 provides an overview of key experimental findings in chaos control and discusses the potential impact across various fields.
following the crisis, trajectories meander across the entire combined larger attractor, alternating between visiting both parts—the original chaotic attractor and the chaotic saddle—intermittently.
consequently, time series obtained from these trajectories display clear intermittent chaotic phases.
research has shown that it is feasible to maintain trajectories in one of these chaotic phases through minor parameter adjustments to the system.
it is notable that similar intermittent chaotic patterns are also observed in biomedical systems.
when measuring the topological entropy of a system while varying a single parameter through the crisis point, it is typically observed that the entropy increases monotonically with the system parameter.
in the symbolic dynamics of two symbols commonly seen in low-dimensional chaotic systems, the topological entropy reaches its maximum limit of ln 2 in a parameter range associated with transient chaos.
therefore, creating a chaotic system that operates within a regime of transient chaos is advantageous for digital encoding purposes.
the following section introduces a theoretical and numerical approach to encoding digital data utilizing transient chaos.
through numerical analysis, we demonstrate that the topological entropies of chaotic saddles generally exceed those of chaotic attractors.
additionally, we outline a method for encoding digital messages within trajectories associated with chaotic saddles.
we propose that utilizing chaotic saddles for digital encoding can enhance resilience against environmental interference, thereby minimizing the likelihood of encoding errors.
lastly, we expound on the concept of message encoding through two-dimensional symbolic dynamics.
through strategic manipulation of the symbolic dynamics of a chaotic system, the system is able to generate trajectories that incorporate digital information.
the methodology being discussed here falls under the umbrella of the second approach, specifically focusing on the control of symbolic dynamics in chaotic systems.
by explicitly calculating the topological entropy, we contend that a dynamical system exhibiting transient chaos on non-attracting chaotic saddles in certain parameter ranges demonstrates a higher capacity for carrying information compared to the same system displaying sustained chaos on attractors.
we outline a procedure, applicable to chaotic systems described by one-dimensional maps, for encoding digital information into typical trajectories meandering near the chaotic saddle.
in the preceding section, we discussed the implementation of the ogy concept for controlling chaotic behaviors, particularly in the context of interacting with chaos.
we now demonstrate that the adaptive method proposed for stabilizing upos can effectively be utilized for achieving chaos synchronization.
synchronizing two identical chaotic systems, despite having different starting points, involves aligning one system's trajectory with that of the other, ensuring they progress in unison through signal transmission.
azevedo and rezende, as well as ditto et al., conducted two separate experiments that share a common concept - preventing significant parameter fluctuations during the control process.
hunt introduced a significant alteration to this approach in their study by enabling substantial perturbations, thereby facilitating the regulation of more intricate periodic behaviors.
this adjustment allowed for the control of higher periodic orbits, with periods reaching up to 23 times the characteristic oscillation period.
situated learning theory expands the notion of learning spaces to encompass more than just traditional classroom settings, incorporating elements like apprenticeships.
it emphasizes that learning environments go beyond the physical classroom and teacher, encompassing socialization within a broader community of practice.
this process involves becoming a member of the community, shaping one's identity, evolving from a novice to an expert under mentorship and hands-on experience, and contributing to the growth and continuity of the community as newcomers join and existing members move on.
individuals who excel in this phase prioritize rational thinking over emotions, focusing on constructing overarching principles rather than relying on instinctual comprehension of details.
they excel in strategic planning, working with abstract concepts and numerical data.
they appreciate accuracy, the methodical approach to scrutinizing concepts, and the elegance of a well-organized theoretical framework.
by translating inquiries about learning psychology into the scientific terms of biology, my intent was not to supplant psychological or psychoanalytical reasoning with cellular molecular biology's logic.
instead, it aimed to bridge these domains, fostering a novel synthesis blending the mental aspects of memory storage with neuronal signaling biology.
i also aspired that probing memory from a biological perspective could unearth additional insights into neuronal signaling, a hope that has indeed come to fruition.
in order to address this issue, it was crucial to understand the pathway through which sensory data related to a learning task reaches the hippocampus, and how the processed information from the hippocampus impacts behavioral responses.
this task was particularly daunting due to the hippocampus's vast number of neurons and intricate network of connections.
it appeared improbable that we could efficiently uncover how the neural circuits containing the hippocampus are involved in behavior and how they are influenced by the learning process within a realistic timeframe.
the reductionist approach was not a new concept in 20th-century biology, as evidenced by the utilization of drosophila in genetics, bacteria and bacteriophages in molecular biology, and the squid giant axon in researching nerve impulse conduction.
however, when it came to exploring behavior, many researchers hesitated to adopt this strategy.
in the 1950s and 1960s, numerous biologists and psychologists doubted the efficacy of using simple animal models, especially invertebrates, in studying learning processes.
their assertion was that only higher animals displayed intricate forms of learning, necessitating neuronal structures and mechanisms distinct from those observed in simpler animals.
in contrast to the trillion central nerve cells found in the mammalian brain, aplysia has a mere 20,000 nerve cells.
the simplest learned behaviors in aplysia may involve less than 100 central nerve cells.
despite their limited number, these cells are the largest nerve cells among animals, reaching a diameter of up to 1000 mm, making them visible to the naked eye.
these large cells can be easily recorded from for long periods without any technical challenges and can be revisited and recorded from over several days.
they can be dissected for biochemical analyses, allowing sufficient mrna to be obtained from a single cell for creating a cdna library.
moreover, these identified cells can be injected with labeled compounds, antibodies, or genetic constructs, enabling the exploration of molecular signal transduction within individual nerve cells.
furthermore, an extended synaptic effect that persists for days can be induced by repetitive action of a modulatory transmitter like serotonin.
this sustained exposure to serotonin prompts second-messenger kinases to move to the nucleus, triggering a series of gene expressions that ultimately facilitate the formation of fresh synaptic connections.
however, this scenario also poses the challenge of synapse specificity, a topic we have previously examined.
our investigations using a bifurcated culture system unveiled an innovative fourth function of neurotransmitters, which involves tagging the synapse and managing local protein production.
this mechanism plays a crucial role in creating synapse-specific long-term facilitation.
i began this essay by highlighting that 40 years ago, when i embarked on my career, i believed that employing a reductionist approach utilizing a simple experimental system like aplysia could help us tackle fundamental inquiries concerning learning and memory.
this initial leap of faith has far exceeded my expectations.
despite this, unraveling the intricacies of explicit memory remains a significant challenge, and our exploration is still at an early stage.
there is much yet to discover about the molecular mechanisms responsible for initiating and perpetuating the synaptic growth linked to long-term memory.
which specific signaling molecules trigger cytoskeletal rearrangements during synaptic remodeling?
how are they interconnected with the molecules governing synapse formation in developmental stages?
in 2003-04, the university established the centre for distance education to extend higher education accessibility to all segments of society.
this initiative serves individuals unable to attend traditional colleges due to various reasons, including financial constraints or domestic responsibilities such as housewives seeking further education.
acharya nagarjuna university introduced b.a. and b.com courses at the undergraduate level and m.a., m.com., m.sc., m.b.a., and l.l.m. programs at the postgraduate level starting from the academic year 2003-2004.
experienced and distinguished teachers have curated these self-instruction materials to enhance comprehension for students enrolled in distance learning programs.
the lessons are meticulously crafted within the designated timeframe by these educators.
both students and teachers are encouraged to provide constructive input and scholarly suggestions to enhance the effectiveness of this distance education approach.
weekly classes and contact sessions will be organized at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels, respectively, to address queries and receive feedback effectively.
a shift in thinking emerged in the 1890s, suggesting the necessity to completely replace established norms rather than just updating prior knowledge with new methods.
the argument was that if there were doubts about the fundamental nature of reality and boundaries limiting human activities were loosening, then art also needed a drastic transformation.
as a result, in the early 1900s, a group of intellectuals, writers, and artists decided to break away from traditional practices in literature, painting, and music.
this modern movement, which started in the first decade of the twentieth century, aimed to revolutionize different art forms by departing significantly from the past.
modernism in music was epitomized by composers like schoenberg, stravinsky, and george antheil.
similarly, in the visual arts, figures such as gustav klimt, picasso, matisse, and mondrian, as well as movements like les fauves, cubism, and the surrealists, captured the essence of modernism.
architectural luminaries like le corbusier, walter gropius, and ludwig mies van der rohe further extended modernist principles into everyday urban design.
even outside the realm of art, influences of modernist ideas were evident; for instance, john maynard keynes drew inspiration from the artistic circles, counting virginia woolf and other bloomsbury group writers among his friends.
modernist literature aimed to break away from the constraints of realist literature by incorporating elements like fragmented timelines.
it was characterized by an emancipatory metanarrative.
following modernism and the post-enlightenment era, metanarratives began to lean towards emancipation, unlike before.
with the backdrop of world war i, the rise of trade unionism, societal dissatisfaction, and the advent of psychoanalysis, contemporary metanarratives started losing relevance.
this shift prompted an increased political significance of culture in meeting the need for a unifying role.
the concept acknowledges that conventional conversations often overlook or downplay certain ideas, topics, or marginalized demographics.
in the 1950s, mainstream media marginalized african americans and hispanics, typically relegating them to servant or character roles.
similarly, groups like the lgbtq+ community, the elderly, and the disabled have also faced marginalization, although this trend is gradually improving.
by highlighting this concept, it prompts us to question areas of society that might be suppressed or denied to varying extents.
this concept acknowledges the narrative-like quality of many of our social constructs.
in the past, a lot of information was presented as objective facts, but there was a reluctance to acknowledge that facts do not exist in isolation.
instead, they are selectively chosen to support specific interpretations or stories, which in turn reinforce particular beliefs and uphold the established position of certain groups.
while the term "narrative" may seem less grandiose compared to "myth," it essentially serves a similar purpose.
individuals, groups, and even nations all possess their curated histories - stories that often rationalize or give meaning to their existence.
within this narrative creation process, elements that do not align are frequently disregarded or suppressed.
consequently, some narratives contribute to the marginalization of sub-groups or issues that present alternative perspectives.
for instance, in the context of the mid-20th century, the narrative depicted cowboys as heroes and native americans as villains.
despite the current disapproval of colonialism, the concept of the "white man's burden" served as a significant rationale for the extensive economic and social exploitation of less technologically advanced societies, masking such actions as efforts to impart the benefits of "civilization" and the "true religion." modernity encompassed pervasive elements like ethnocentrism, nationalism, racial superiority, the dissociation of business and ethics, and an almost religious faith in science.
while modernity was predominantly patriarchal, although the most overt forms are now less acceptable, traces of these attitudes persist.
postmodernism is an intellectual movement that originated approximately from the 1960s onwards.
a key tenet of postmodernism is the rejection of any notion of objective and absolute truth, favoring instead the perspective that ideas are products of societal constructs.
it is a diverse movement characterized by a variety of writers who frequently hold differing viewpoints.
while lacking a definitive manifesto or unified agreement, the aforementioned principles can be identified as unifying themes.
postmodernism encompasses various positions, ranging from radical to more tempered perspectives.
additionally, it can be viewed as an intellectual reaction to the conditions of the postmodern era.
frye introduces the concepts of 'centripetal' and 'centrifugal' to define his approach to criticism.
he explains that criticism is centripetal when it delves into the inner layers of a text's structure and centrifugal when it branches out towards society and the broader world.
for instance, in lyric poetry like keats's "ode on a grecian urn", the focus is primarily centripetal, emphasizing the sonic quality, movement, and imagery within the carefully crafted words.
on the other hand, novels with strong rhetoric, such as uncle tom's cabin, lean towards being centrifugal, highlighting the narrative's connections to societal norms and characters.
the "ode" demonstrates centrifugal inclinations by drawing from historical contexts, pottery, and visual aesthetics for impact.
contrastingly, uncle tom's cabin displays centripetal tendencies by relying on syntax and vocabulary to portray characters and set the tone.
one movement points inward while the other expands outwardly.
this critical perspective alternates between focusing centripetally on literature's aesthetic role and centrifugally on its social implications.
in essence, according to frye, literature is not imitative.
rather than reflecting reality, literary writers intricately rework in their works ancient pre-literary mythical narratives, which form the core of human cultural legacy.
the human behaviors portrayed are fundamentally rooted in the symbolic representations attached by humans to natural occurrences, aimed at humanizing a fundamentally elusive and incomprehensible natural world.
importantly, the selection of narrative form is not a conscious decision by the writer to align with a specific genre.
instead, it stems from the collective unconscious of humanity: when exploring facets of human life, suitable forms organically present themselves.
fanon argues in the wretched of the earth that the colonizer's dominance in algeria is maintained solely through military power.
consequently, any opposition to this supremacy must take a violent form as it is the only method of communication understood by the oppressors.
therefore, the necessity of resorting to violent resistance is a result of the forceful imposition of the colonizers on the colonized people.
fanon's work delves into the significance of language and the transformation of discourse, making it an interdisciplinary masterpiece that touches on a wide array of fields including psychiatry, politics, sociology, anthropology, linguistics, and literature.
the caribbean philosophical association presents the frantz fanon prize to commend contributions that advance the processes of decolonization and the emancipation of humanity.
fanon's exploration of black sexuality in his seminal work, black skin, white masks, has stimulated considerable interest among numerous scholars and theorists in the realm of queer studies.
by examining fanon's views on the complexities of black homosexuality and masculinity, academics in queer theory have generated diverse critical analyses of fanon's ideas, seeking to reconcile his role in postcolonial studies with his impact on the evolution of modern black queer theory.
in colonial countries where a genuine struggle for freedom has been fought, with the shedding of people's blood and a prolonged period of armed conflict that has allowed intellectuals to reconnect with the grassroots, we witness a true dismantling of the intellectual superstructure imposed by bourgeois colonialists.
the colonial bourgeoisie, through its self-centered discourse propagated in academic institutions, had ingrained in the minds of native intellectuals the belief that certain western qualities are timeless despite any human errors.
the native thinkers had internalized these notions, with a staunch defense of greco-latin ideals at their core.
however, in the fight for liberation, as the native intellectuals reunite with their people, this artificial defense crumbles into insignificance.
history demonstrates that the struggle against colonialism often does not initially align with nationalist sentiments.
initially, the focus of the indigenous population tends to be on rectifying specific injustices such as forced labor, physical punishment, wage disparities, and restrictions on political rights.
over time, the battle against the oppression of humanity evolves from a pursuit of democracy, gradually moving away from the complexities of neo-liberalism towards a more distinct demand for self-governance.
this evolution is hindered by the ill-preparedness of the educated elite, their lack of connection with the general population, their complacency, and their reluctance to take decisive action when it counts, leading to unfortunate outcomes.
the emerging national middle class that assumes power following the colonial rule is notably underdeveloped.
lacking substantial economic influence, it falls short in comparison to the bourgeoisie of the colonizing nation it aims to supplant.
driven by a sense of self-importance, this national middle class naively believes it can replace its colonial counterpart.
however, as it struggles for independence, it finds itself in desperate situations, ultimately reaching out to the former colonial power for aid.
the educated elite and business community, representing the most knowledgeable segment of the new state, are constrained by their limited numbers, urban concentration, and involvement in sectors such as commerce, agriculture, and the professions.
notably absent from this national middle class are financiers and industrial leaders.
the national bourgeoisie in underdeveloped countries is primarily involved in intermediary activities rather than production, invention, or labor.
their main focus appears to be staying in the race and benefiting from existing networks.
their mindset resembles that of a businessman rather than an industrial leader, which can be attributed to the limited opportunities caused by colonialism.
the accumulation of wealth by the middle class was nearly impossible under colonial rule.
it seems that the genuine purpose of the national middle class in such countries should be to reject their bourgeois nature, as a tool of capitalism, and instead align themselves with the revolutionary capital represented by the people.
in an underdeveloped nation, the authentic national middle class should see it as a moral obligation to reject the predestined path laid out for them and instead, immerse themselves in learning from the people.
this means utilizing the intellectual and technical knowledge acquired from colonial universities for the benefit of the community.
unfortunately, it is observed that the national middle class frequently fails to take this noble, beneficial, and fair route.
instead, they blend into the decadent customs of a conventional bourgeoisie, which is ignorant, disdainful, and selfishly self-serving - a stark divergence from the nation's interests.
emaciated and ailing, should they retain a glimmer of determination, it is the grip of fear that will ultimately complete their downfall; rifles are pointed menacingly at the peasant; civilians arrive to seize control of his property, coercing him through brutal beatings to cultivate the land on their behalf.
should he resist, the soldiers will not hesitate to shoot, sealing his fate; if he submits, he compromises his dignity, ceasing to be a man at all; disgrace and terror will erode his integrity, causing his very essence to crumble.
the operations are executed with precision and expertise; the tactics of "psychological services" have long been in place; as has the practice of brainwashing.
despite all the efforts invested, their objectives remain elusive: be it in the congo where hands of the natives were mutilated, or in angola where dissidents' mouths were recently pierced for closure with padlocks.
i do not claim that transforming a man into a brute is unattainable; rather, it necessitates significantly weakening him.
mere physical abuse is inadequate; to truly achieve this, one must intensify deprivation, thereby exposing the inherent brutality of slavery.
the emerging national middle class that assumes power as the colonial regime ends is considered an underdeveloped faction.
lacking significant economic influence, it pales in comparison to the bourgeois class of the colonizing nation it aims to supplant.
driven by a sense of self-importance, this national middle class believes it can seamlessly take over from its colonial counterpart.
however, this pursuit of independence pushes it into a corner, leading to internal turmoil and ultimately prompting desperate pleas for assistance from the very colonizers they sought to replace.
pre-independence, a leader typically represents the populace's desires for freedom, political rights, and national pride.
however, once independence is achieved, instead of focusing on addressing the essential needs of the people such as food, land, and reclaiming the nation for its citizens, the leader often reveals a hidden agenda - aiming to secure a position as the overall president favored by a group of entrepreneurs eager for profits, comprising the local bourgeoisie.
the actions of the national landowners closely mirror those of the urban middle class.
upon gaining independence, large-scale farmers have been advocating for the nationalization of agricultural production.
through various manipulative tactics, they successfully take over farms previously belonging to settlers, thereby strengthening their control over the region.
however, they fail to implement innovative farming techniques, increase productivity, or align their agricultural practices with the development of a truly national economy.
the exploitation of agricultural workers is set to increase and be justified.
the new settlers will demand extensive labor from the agricultural workforce under patriotic rhetoric.
there will be no advancements in farming practices, no developmental strategies, and a lack of entrepreneurial spirit.
any attempts at innovation cause anxiety among the cautious land-owning class complying with colonial norms.
improvement initiatives in these areas typically stem from government mandates, endorsement, and funding.
the landed bourgeoisie staunchly avoids taking any risks and adamantly resists engaging in ventures or hazards.
their focus is on making secure and lucrative investments with prompt returns.
despite reaping substantial profits, which are notable in the national revenue context, they rarely reinvest.
this group of landowners predominantly harbors a mindset akin to hoarding money in their proverbial stockings.
at times, particularly in the years directly following independence, the bourgeoisie does not shy away from stashing their native soil earnings in foreign banks.
conversely, significant amounts of wealth are splurged on conspicuous consumption like cars, rural estates, and other markers that economists aptly link to an immature bourgeoisie in an underdeveloped setting.
after gaining power, the indigenous bourgeoisie aggressively aims to secure positions previously held by foreigners.
following independence, they launch violent attacks against colonial figures such as lawyers, merchants, landowners, doctors, and senior officials.
their conflict with these individuals is driven by a desire to protect the nation's dignity.
they advocate for the nationalization and africanization of leadership roles.
this pursuit gradually escalates into racism, with the bourgeoisie boldly demanding these positions from the government, ultimately aiming to dominate all spheres until they have claimed complete control.
in ivory coast, the tensions against the dahoman and voltaic groups are essentially racial conflicts.
upon the declaration of independence, these groups, who dominate a significant portion of the small-scale trade, become targets of animosity from the local population.
the shift is seen from nationalism to extreme nationalism, then chauvinism, and ultimately racism.
the foreigners are demanded to depart as their stores are set on fire, their market stalls vandalized, and the ivorian government enforces their expulsion to appease its citizens.
periodically, the leader puts forth efforts by addressing the public through radio broadcasts or embarking on national tours with the intention of soothing and captivating the population.
the presence of the leader is deemed essential due to the absence of a functioning political party.
it is noted that during the struggle for independence, a party under the leadership of the current head was in place.
however, over time, this party has disintegrated, leaving behind merely the superficial elements such as the name, emblem, and motto.
the dynamic essence of the party, which should facilitate the constructive exchange of ideas tailored to the genuine requirements of the populace, has deteriorated into a mere association of self-serving agendas.
following the declaration of independence, the party no longer serves as a platform to voice the demands of the people, enhance their awareness of their needs, or empower them effectively.
presently, the objective of the party is to communicate the directives originating from the top leadership to the people.
the once thriving exchange of ideas and feedback between the grassroots and leadership, crucial for fostering and preserving democracy within a party, has disappeared.
instead, the party now acts as a barrier separating the masses from the decision-makers.
party activities have dwindled as the branches established in the colonial era are now inert.
our analysis of the national bourgeoisie in underdeveloped countries leads us to a predictable conclusion.
it is imperative to prevent this class from thriving and expanding by ensuring that the necessary conditions for its existence are not met.
hence, a united front of awakened intellectuals and the masses, guided by a revolutionary party, must actively obstruct the development of this unproductive and detrimental middle class.
the settler had a desire for the native to show enthusiasm.
through a process of mystification that detached the native from reality, the settler aimed to convince the laborer that the land he toiled on and the mines in which he sacrificed his health were his own.
the settler disregarded the truth that his wealth flourished at the expense of the enslaved.
essentially, the settler implied to the native, "sacrifice yourself so that i may prosper." presently, a different approach is necessary.
we must refrain from instructing people to sacrifice themselves for the nation's economic growth.
to enhance national revenue, reduce the unnecessary importation of goods, increase agricultural output, and combat illiteracy, it is vital to clearly communicate our intentions.
it is crucial for the public to comprehend the implications of the situation.
the affairs of the governing bodies should be transparent and inclusive.
therefore, there is an urgent need to establish numerous well-informed community centers at the grassroots level.
often, we tend to focus on creating national organizations predominantly in the capital, such as the women's union, the young people's federation, and trade unions.
however, upon closer inspection of these central offices, one would be dismayed by their lack of substance and authenticity.
it is essential to have solid foundations and active local groups that can provide meaningful contributions.
communities should have the opportunity to convene, exchange ideas, make suggestions, and receive guidance.
the essence of a nation is reflected in the evolving awareness of its entire population; it manifests through the unified and enlightened efforts of both men and women.
shaping a collective destiny entails assuming historical responsibility on a grand scale.
without this, chaos, repression, and the reemergence of regional factions and separatism may prevail.
for a government to truly represent the nation, it must govern with and for the people, including those marginalized.
no matter how capable a leader may be, they cannot replace the voice of the public.
before focusing on global reputation, a national government should prioritize restoring dignity to all its citizens, enriching their lives with meaningful experiences, and fostering a society where conscious and empowered individuals thrive.
said contended that orientalist studies are deeply intertwined with the imperialist origins that gave rise to them, making much of the research politically motivated and subservient to power, therefore casting doubt on its intellectual merit.
the central idea in orientalism revolves around the politicization of communication in regards to the middle east, suggesting that orientalist discussions stem from a specific cultural context influenced by the underlying principles of that political environment.
this, in turn, impacts both the political dynamics within the area under study and the perception of its culture.
throughout my body of work, i have consistently maintained a critical stance towards boastful and unexamined nationalism.
my perspective on palestine has not wavered: i have voiced various concerns regarding the casual nativism and aggressive militancy within the nationalist mindset.
instead, i have advocated for a thoughtful examination of the arab context, palestinian history, and the realities in israel.
i have explicitly argued that a resolution can only be achieved through a negotiated agreement between the two afflicted communities, arab and jewish, as a means to find relief from the perpetual conflict.
it is not controversial to suggest that, in the late nineteenth century, an englishman in india or egypt would naturally view these countries through the lens of them being british colonies.
this viewpoint, intertwined with the colonial status, influenced academic knowledge about these regions during that time.
in my study of orientalism, i am arguing that this political reality significantly impacted and shaped academic perceptions of india and egypt.
one of said's key insights into interpreting orientalism involves several notable points.
firstly, he aligns with disraeli in rejecting the notion that the east is merely a concept devoid of real-world existence.
he highlights how numerous western scholars have dedicated their lifework to studying the orient, emphasizing the tangible nature of this subject.
additionally, said emphasizes the importance of acknowledging the dominance exerted by the west over eastern societies.
he argues that orientalism as a field of study emerged due to the power dynamics and control imposed by the west on the east.
furthermore, said delves into the distinction between various types of society and their cultural influences.
drawing on antonio gramsci's ideas, he contrasts civil society, where citizens willingly adopt social roles, with political society, where the state enforces dominance.
according to gramsci, cultural endeavors stem primarily from civil society, where individuals choose their responsibilities.
in his final thoughts, said explores the rationale underpinning the impossibility of harboring a favorable perception of arab life in the western world.
he emphasizes that his personal encounters as an individual of arab origin were the driving force behind his decision to address orientalism.
despite being directly impacted by the adverse western depictions of the arab world and the orient as a whole, said's assessment offers a remarkably impartial and refined perspective on orientalism.
this might be attributed to his enduring encounters with ingrained stereotypes and the evident contrast between western and eastern stances on the matter.
edward said expressed his pride in the accomplishments of individuals from his ancestral lands.
he believed that it was derogatory for westerners to associate places like baghdad or cairo solely with belly dancers and monkeys.
said acknowledged the existence of such stereotypes but contended that they were overemphasized and should not be the prevailing image associated with these cities.
said highlighted that the west employed subtle tactics in undermining these institutions.
while a european monarch known for excessive revelry might be criticized for having many mistresses, an ottoman or arab leader would be faulted for excessive time spent in the harem.
though the distinction in wording may seem minor, said argues that it holds significant implications.
the former implies a sense of discretion for the king, while the latter conjures images of the ottoman or arab ruler being pampered with hand-fed grapes and fanned with large ostrich feathers.
however, the significant concern lay not only in the fact that outsiders were adopting these new perspectives.
the influential members of middle eastern society, who typically relied on english, german, and french literature to explore their histories, were also being influenced by these biases.
in essence, the elites in the middle east were beginning to perceive their ancestors in a negative light, disregarding the ample evidence contradicting such views.
for the advancement of arab nationalism advocated by said, it was crucial that individuals could look back with pride and embrace their heritage.
in 1967, a set of three books was published that extensively discussed derrida's theoretical framework.
derrida's goal was to delve into the core of the western intellectual tradition, which he defined as a pursuit for a transcendental being that acts as the source or guarantor of meaning.
he referred to the effort to establish meaning relations grounded in something beyond relationality as "logocentrism," a term coined by heidegger.
derrida contended that the philosophical endeavor is fundamentally logocentric, a legacy inherited from judaism and hellenism, which he critiqued as being phallocratic, patriarchal, and masculinist.
in addition to explicit political engagements, derrida was immersed in a reevaluation of politics and its nature, both within philosophy and beyond.
he emphasized that his writings have always carried a discernible political undercurrent from the outset of his career.
however, his focus on unraveling the political implications of concepts such as responsibility, reason of state, the other, decision, sovereignty, europe, friendship, difference, faith, and more, intensified notably from the early 1990s onwards.
by 2000, a significant shift towards theorizing about a "democracy to come" and reflecting on the constraints of existing democracies had emerged as key preoccupations.
what is the essence of the concept of structure that husserl relies on to differentiate between empirical, eidetic, and transcendental aspects, and how has this essence remained consistent despite evolving interpretations?
furthermore, what is the historical and semantic interplay between genesis and structure in a broader context?
asking these questions goes beyond mere linguistic inquiry; it delves into the cohesive historical foundation that enables a transcendental reduction and its intrinsic drive.
it aims to uncover the unity of the world that transcendental freedom liberates itself from, revealing the origin of this unity.
post-structuralism defies simple definition or summary; it is essentially a collection of diverse responses to structuralism.
the challenge in defining it stems from its rejection of any claims of possessing definitive "truths" or objective realities.
moreover, individuals who align with post-structuralist ideas rarely adopt the label willingly; rather, others ascribe it to them.
as a result, there is no unified manifesto to encapsulate post-structuralism due to its inherent resistance to being rigidly categorized or delineated.
the classification of post-structuralism as a movement sometimes originates from the rising critique of structuralism coinciding with the upsurge of structuralism's prominence in american universities.
this growing interest led to a significant event in 1966, a conference at johns hopkins university that featured key structuralist figures like derrida, barthes, and lacan.
derrida's presentation at this conference, titled "structure, sign, and play in the human sciences," is often regarded as a pivotal critique of structuralism.
his essay was among the earliest to outline theoretical boundaries of structuralism and explore new theoretical avenues beyond its scope.
derrida emerged on the public speaking and writing scene amidst a growing division within the french intellectual sphere between "phenomenological" and "structural" approaches to understanding both individual and collective existence.
the "phenomenological" camp sought to delve into the comprehension and depiction of experience by exploring its origins and the process of its unfolding from an initial source or event.
in contrast, the structuralists dismissed this as a false issue, positing that the depth of experience was merely an outcome of non-experiential structures.
it was against this backdrop that in 1959, derrida posed the question: shouldn't structures themselves have an origin, and isn't this origin, the point of inception, already structured to give rise to something?
it is entirely feasible to demonstrate that the concept of structure and the term "structure" itself have origins as ancient as the episteme - synonymous with the advent of western science and western philosophy - with their foundations deeply entrenched in everyday language.
the episteme delves into the profound layers of ordinary language to reintegrate these concepts in a metaphorical displacement.
however, prior to the seminal event i aim to delineate and elucidate, structure - or more accurately, the structurality within structure - though always inherent, had been consistently neutralized or constrained through a process of centralization or tethering to a fixed origin point.
the role of this center was not solely to steer, stabilize, and structure the framework - as an unstructured structure would be inconceivable - but primarily to ensure that the organizing principle of structure restricted what could be described as the unrestricted interplay within the structure.
it could be argued that the framework of both archaeology and eschatology contributes to diminishing the essence of structure by striving to understand it through the lens of a complete presence that is beyond reach.
what i termed a rupture, the disturbance referred to in the earlier parts of this paper, likely occurred when there was a need to reexamine the structurality of structure, implying a need for it to be reconsidered and reiterated.
this is why i mentioned that this disruption encompassed repetition in all its connotations.
it then became essential to contemplate the principle that directed, in a way, the longing for the core in the establishment of structure and the system of meaning determining its shifts and replacements, rather than the law of the central presence - a presence that was fundamentally displaced from itself into its substitute.
the substitute doesn't take the place of something that already existed in some form prior to its introduction.
from that point onward, it became necessary to entertain the idea that a central point might not exist, that attempting to conceive the center as a tangible entity was futile, and that it did not have a defined place but was a functional concept - almost like a non-place where numerous substitutions of signs were at play.
it was a crucial juncture where language permeated the fundamental questions; a juncture where, with the center or origin missing, everything transitioned into discourse - assuming we can reach a consensus on this term - essentially evolving into a structure where the core meaning, the originating or transcendent meaning, never definitively exists independently but within a network of distinctions.
the absence of this transcendent meaning broadens the scope and complexity of signification indefinitely.
disregarding the principles of metaphysics while attempting to criticize metaphysics is nonsensical.
we lack a language, encompassing both syntax and vocabulary, that operates outside of this philosophical tradition.
every undermining statement aligns inherently with the structure, reasoning, and assumptions of the very system it challenges.
for instance, the critique against the metaphysics of presence employs the notion of the "sign." however, if one aims to illustrate that there is no absolute or superior meaning and that the realm of meaning is boundless, they must also reject the idea and the term "sign" itself.
this proves unfeasible, as the concept of "sign" has always been defined and understood in relation to a signified element, involving a distinction between the signifier and the signified.
the discussion about the sign presented here can be applied to all metaphysical concepts and statements, particularly concerning the discourse on "structure." there exist various ways in which individuals get trapped in this cycle, ranging from more naive to more empirical, and from more systematic to closer formulations or formalizations of the cycle.
these differences contribute to the diversity of conflicting discourses and the disagreements among those presenting them.
figures like nietzsche, freud, and heidegger operated within metaphysical concepts.
given that these concepts are not standalone elements but derive from syntax and a system, each specific adoption carries the entire weight of metaphysics.
this phenomenon enables these critics to mutually critique each other, as seen in heidegger evaluating nietzsche as the ultimate metaphysician and "platonist" with equal clarity, rigor, bad faith, and misinterpretation.
this moment is not primarily about philosophical or scientific discussions; it also encompasses political, economic, technical, and various other dimensions.
it is evident that the critique of ethnocentrism, which is integral to ethnology, coincides systematically and historically with the decline of metaphysical history.
these two phenomena are inherently linked within the same period.
ethnology, like any scientific field, exists within the realm of discourse.
it is primarily a european academic discipline that utilizes conventional concepts, even as it endeavors to challenge them.
therefore, regardless of their intent, ethnologists inevitably incorporate ethnocentric ideals into their discourse, even as they aim to critique them.
this unavoidable necessity is not merely a historical accident but a fundamental aspect that must be carefully contemplated.
while no one can escape this requirement, and no one should be faulted for succumbing to it to some extent, not all forms of yielding to it hold the same significance.
the effectiveness and productivity of a dialogue may be gauged by the extent to which it critically examines its connection to the history of metaphysics and inherited concepts.
this pertains to a critical engagement with the language of the social sciences and to a critical accountability within the discourse.
the reason for focusing on analyzing the writings of levi-strauss is not solely due to the special status given to ethnology among human sciences or the significant influence of levi-strauss on current theoretical perspectives.
the primary motive lies in the distinct direction taken in levi-strauss's work and the development of a particular doctrine that addresses the critical examination of language within the realm of human sciences, albeit sometimes implicitly, and its relevance to the critique articulated in this context.
let's assume that anything universal within humans originates from nature's order and is marked by spontaneity, whereas anything that adheres to a standard belongs to culture and embodies the qualities of the relative and the specific.
this leads us to a situation that may seem somewhat scandalous based on the aforementioned definitions: the prohibition of incest clearly embodies, without any doubt, the two characteristics representing contradictory attributes of two distinct orders.
the prohibition of incest serves as a regulation, unique among all social regulations, as it simultaneously holds a universal nature.
to avoid the potentially sterilizing impact of the former approach, the alternative - which i believe aligns more closely with levi-strauss's method - involves retaining all those traditional concepts in the realm of empirical exploration, while also highlighting their limitations sporadically.
these concepts are viewed as instruments that can still provide utility without ascribing any inherent truth value to them.
there is a willingness to discard them if necessary, in favor of more effective tools.
in the meantime, their relative effectiveness is leveraged to dismantle the outdated system they belong to, of which they are a part.
this is how the language of the human sciences engages in self-critique.
in "the savage mind," levi-strauss introduces the concept of bricolage as an approach that can be regarded as a method of discourse.
according to him, a bricoleur is someone who utilizes the resources available to them, such as the tools found in their immediate environment, which were not specifically intended for the task at hand.
through trial and error, the bricoleur adapts these tools without hesitation, modifying or combining them as needed, even if they differ in form and origin.
this perspective views bricolage as a form of critiquing language, suggesting that bricolage is inherently a form of critical language itself.
as we believe we have unraveled them from one another and can keep them distinct, we soon discover they are reuniting once more, drawn by unforeseen similarities.
as a result, the coherence of the myth is merely peripheral and imaginative; it never captures a fixed condition or moment of the myth.
serving as a fictional aspect resulting from the attempt to analyze, its purpose is to provide a cohesive structure to the myth and prevent it from disintegrating into a jumble of contradictions.
it can be argued that the study or understanding of myths is a refraction, using this ancient term in a broad sense drawn from its roots, a discipline that encompasses the examination of reflected as well as fragmented components.
however, unlike philosophical contemplation that seeks to trace things back to their origin, the reflections under discussion here pertain to rays lacking a concrete focus other than a theoretical one.
i have argued that empiricism is the root cause of the flaws that plague a discourse that strives to be scientific, just as seen with levi-strauss.
delving into the profound discussion of empiricism and bricolage would likely lead us to conflicting propositions about the nature of discourse in structural ethnography.
on one hand, structuralism rightly serves as a critique of empiricism.
critics who may fault me for not starting by compiling an exhaustive list of south american myths prior to analyzing them would misunderstand the essence and purpose of these narratives.
the collective body of a people's myths resembles a continuous narrative.
as long as the community persists, this body of myths remains open-ended.
in this sense, critiquing this approach would be like criticizing a linguist for creating a language's grammar without documenting every word ever spoken in that language's history and without predicting all future verbal interactions as long as the language endures.
the limited number of sentences a linguist needs to develop a grammar for a language has been proven by experience.
having either a partial or an outlined grammar is highly beneficial when the language is unfamiliar.
syntax is not dependent on a vast number of events to manifest itself but rather on the rules governing the creation of these events.
in this case, the focus was on outlining the syntax of south american mythology.
any new texts that enhance the mythical narrative can be used to review, adjust, or even discover new grammatical rules.
the necessity of a complete mythical discourse cannot be demanded as it has been established that such a demand is meaningless.
once again, i argue that levi-strauss's discourses implicitly embody both of these determinations.
the impossibility of totalization, as classically perceived, suggests a futile pursuit within finite constraints to grasp an infinite richness beyond reach.
the overwhelming abundance defies complete articulation.
however, non-totalization can also be framed differently, not solely through the lens of finite concepts constricting empirical understanding, but by embracing the notion of free play.
the absence of significance in totalization doesn't stem from the incapacity of a finite perspective to encompass the infinite vastness of a domain, but rather from the inherent nature of the domain itself - such as language and its finite limitations - that inherently resists totalization.
this field allows for limitless substitutions precisely because it is finite, meaning that, rather than being an endless field as in the classical assumption, and instead of being overly extensive, there is a crucial element missing from it: a central point that halts and establishes the unrestricted exchange of substitutions.
it could be argued—using that term with full precision, a term whose provocative connotation is often overlooked in french—that this unrestricted play, facilitated by the absence of a center or origin, signifies a movement of supplementation.
the central point, the sign that supplements it, filling its place in its non-existence, cannot be precisely identified because this sign adds itself, presents itself additionally, in addition, as a supplement.
the process of signification involves an addition, leading to a perpetual presence of surplus, however, this addition is fluctuating because it serves to fulfill a substitute role, compensating for a deficiency in the signified.
in simpler terms, following mauss's principle that all social phenomena can be likened to language, concepts like mana, wakau, oranda, and similar notions represent a conscious expression of a semantic function.
this function allows symbolic thought to function despite its inherent contradictions.
thus, these ideas clarify the seemingly unsolvable conflicts associated with mana.
mana embodies multiple paradoxes; it is both force and action, quality and state, noun, and verb, abstract and concrete, omnipresent yet localized.
mana's essence lies in its ability to embody all these aspects while remaining distinct from them, making it a pure symbol capable of embodying any symbolic meaning.
the tension arises primarily in its historical context.
this issue is a recurring challenge, the counterarguments to which have become somewhat commonplace.
to me, the essence of the problem lies in levi-strauss's reduction of history, effectively giving due consideration to a concept that has long been entwined with teleological and eschatological metaphysics.
paradoxically, history has been complicit with a philosophy of presence, which was traditionally seen as its antithesis.
the theme of historicity, though a relatively recent addition to philosophical discourse, has always been intrinsic to the idea of being as presence.
despite the traditional conflict between these concepts in classical thought, it can be argued that the notion of episteme has always evoked that of historia.
history, whether through etymology or not, embodies a unity of transformation, serving as a conduit for truth's traditions, scientific advancements, or knowledge seeking to grasp truth in its immediacy and self-awareness.
the conventional view of history has typically been seen as a cyclical repetition, a departure from and return to prior states.
however, questioning this notion could lead to the danger of reverting to a traditional historical perspective, lacking a clear acknowledgement of the issue i am raising.
this could result in a return to a certain period in the history of metaphysics.
this is how i perceive the core issue.
specifically, examining levi-strauss's work shows that upholding the significance of structure necessitates a detachment from time and historical context.
when a new structure or system emerges, it does so through a rupture with its past, its origins, and its causes, which is essential for its distinct structural characteristics.
in addition to the interplay with historical context, there is also an interplay with the concept of presence.
free play represents a disturbance in the notion of presence, where the existence of a component serves as a meaningful and interchangeable reference within a framework of distinctions and a sequence of connections.
free play essentially involves a dynamic relationship between absence and presence.
however, for a more profound understanding, it is essential to consider free play as the primary concept, existing independently of the dichotomy of presence and absence.
rather than starting with the distinction between presence and absence, the conception of being should commence with the idea of free play.
levi-strauss, more so than anyone else, has illuminated the concept of the intertwined dynamics between repetition and play, showcasing a profound sense of ethical essence within his work.
this ethic is characterized by a longing for origins, a yearning for a primal and untainted innocence, and a purity of expression and self-awareness in communication.
this nostalgia, ethics, and at times remorse are frequently depicted as the driving force behind his ethnological pursuits, particularly as he delves into ancient and exemplary societies.
these works are widely recognized and admired.
as a shift towards the presence, whether lost or unattainable, of the missing source, this structuralist theme of disrupted immediacy represents the melancholic, pessimistic, nostalgically guilty, rousseauistic aspect of the concept of unrestricted freedom, counterbalanced by the nietzschean perspective - the joyful embrace of the uninhibited freedom in a world devoid of truth or fixed origins, left open to dynamic interpretation.
this affirmation defines the absence of a fixed center as a form of loss and engages in uncertainty.
amidst absolute randomness, affirmation also embraces genetic uncertainty and the foundational journey of traces.
there are two main interpretations of structure, sign, and free play.
one interpretation aims to uncover a truth or origin devoid of free play and sign order, constantly striving to decode and feeling constrained by the need for interpretation.
the other interpretation, no longer fixated on origins, embraces free play and attempts to transcend human limitations, distancing itself from anthropocentrism.
this interpretation acknowledges the historical human quest for absolute presence, a stable foundation that represents both the origin and the ultimate goal of existence throughout the course of metaphysical and ontological history.
here lies a type of question, perhaps historical in nature, of which we are only beginning to grasp the conception, formation, gestation, and labor today.
i use these terms acknowledging their association with childbirth, but also considering those, myself included, who avert their gaze when confronted with that which is still unnamed but is making its presence known.
this revelation can only manifest under the guise of formlessness, silence, infancy, and a frightening monstrosity that signifies the imminent birth.
feminist critics strongly condemn the violence against belinda and her portrayal as powerless.
they aim to highlight the image of women that pope has created to cater to male interests.
their feminist critique, seen as a form of feminist criticism, views women as the audience for predominantly male-authored texts.
accordingly, feminists strive to identify the depictions and stereotypes of women depicted in these male-driven narratives.
this approach is commonly referred to as traditional feminist criticism, wherein women are positioned as the target audience for literary creations.
showalter points out in her analysis of the mayor of casterbridge that traditional literary criticism tends to be male-centric, portraying women based on male perceptions of them.
this kind of criticism often perpetuates the oppression of women and glamorizes victimization.
despite these issues, significant contributions have been made within this framework.
approaches such as hermeneutics, ideological criticism, psychoanalytic criticism, and new historicism offer valuable tools for conducting this type of analysis, although expertise in male-dominated critical traditions may be necessary.
during the era marked by the suffrage movement for women, significant feminist activism took place with writers actively endorsing and even spearheading these political and social movements.
this, in turn, triggered a backlash within both male and female circles, where some women aligned with men either for self-preservation or due to a lack of awareness of the issues at hand.
for example, queenie leavis fiercely criticized virginia woolf for her incisive and impassioned polemic, the three guineas, penned in the early 1930s.
the essays in the dialogic imagination are centered around literary theory and share a common theme of examining the novel as a unique and evolving genre.
bakhtin delves into the distinct characteristics of the novel, its connections with other genres, and its historical evolution.
unlike more rigid genres like the epic, bakhtin argues that the novel is dynamic and constantly evolving, defying easy classification.
throughout these essays, bakhtin frequently uses the novel as a tool to probe his ideas on language's essence and its interactions with societal frameworks.
the main emphasis here is on the exploration of the novel and the significance of studying it.
unlike older genres like the epic and tragedy, which are rigid and established, the novel is a newer genre with a flexible framework.
this flexibility allows the novel to evolve and adapt continuously.
in comparison, older genres have rigid structures that limit their growth potential.
it could even be argued that pushing the boundaries of these older genres may cause them to lose their essence or coherence.
the essay utilizes the notion of chronotope to emphasize the unique nature of the novel.
chronotope, derived from the words "time-space," is elucidated by bakhtin as the interconnection of temporal and spatial elements artistically portrayed in literature.
authors, in their writing endeavors, must construct complete universes that necessitate the utilization of familiar real-world organizational structures.
hence, the concept of chronotope serves as a tool that delves into reality.
the separation of aesthetics from philosophy is not a weakness; in fact, it offers various benefits.
it allows for independence from ideological limitations and the risks associated with developing multiple theories.
consequently, aestheticians have the liberty to introduce vyangyartha.
this unique theory of significance provides a fresh perspective on the essence of art.
when such a theory is not essential, they can choose from various philosophical perspectives depending on the circumstances.
this eclectic approach is more objective and preferable to adhering strictly to a single philosophical standpoint.
the idealistic perspective: idealists believe that nature is inherently beautiful in its entirety, but when viewed in isolation, it may not always appear as such and could even seem unattractive.
while some individuals who have a holistic view of nature may consider art unnecessary, many others appreciate its importance.
according to vedanta philosophy, when a person attains enlightenment and recognizes the ultimate truth, they perceive the magnificence of existence everywhere and experience a state of divine bliss.
until then, true beauty can only be found in art.
even elements of nature that initially seem beautiful may lose their appeal over time or based on our changing perspectives.
therefore, the expression of art remains essential to capture and preserve beauty.
one key aspect is unselfishness, which differs from mere outward displays driven by self-interest.
genuine unselfishness is intrinsic and all-encompassing, where individuals become so selfless they transcend their personal identity in the immersive experience of art.
this selflessness entails a disinterested admiration of beauty, devoid of personal motives.
secondly, stemming from this unselfishness, is a profound joy that is free from any negativity, offering a transcendent experience surpassing the anxieties of daily life.
in the ninth century, a shift occurred with the emergence of the rasadhavani school established by anandavardhana and later by abhinavagupta, which proposed a new perspective on artistic content.
according to this school, content in art goes beyond mere external meaning and instead emphasizes the significance of emotion.
art is seen as a medium that engages the imagination and evokes emotions.
the emotional essence portrayed by the artist is considered the true substance of art, leading to a specific experience known as rasa in the audience.
in this context, the quality of meaning in art is valued only in its ability to evoke the intended emotion.
any discrepancy between the meaning and emotion conveyed may result in a failure to evoke the desired artistic response in the audience.
dohara kakkaiah, a dalit poet by birth, is another notable figure mentioned in literary circles, known for six confessional poems that have been preserved.
modern dalit literature traces its origins to influential leaders such as mahatma phule and dr.
babasaheb ambedkar in maharashtra, who raised awareness about dalit issues through their writings.
this movement sparked a new wave of dalit literature, motivating many dalits to express themselves through writing in languages such as marathi, hindi, and punjabi.
after 60 years of gaining independence, india is indeed shining, but for whom?
while the indian economy shows great strength, it prompts us to ponder - has india truly empowered the weaker sections?
despite elaborate policies purportedly aimed at uplifting dalits, many governments have fallen short.
allocated provisions in the budget for dalits and adivasis often seem nominal, merely for show.
sadly, funds meant for the welfare of dalits are frequently redirected for other agendas, leaving the intended beneficiaries underserved.
the government has recently begun to offer reservations to the jain, muslim, and sheikh communities, recognizing them as minority groups.
unlike in many parts of the world where reservations are typically based on caste or race, this initiative is based on religion.
dalit literature serves as a poignant reflection of the realities of indian society.
despite the presence of equality in theory, many dalits continue to endure lives akin to servitude in various parts of india.
the literature of the dalit community portrays their experiences of suffering, adversity, torture, and dehumanization.
the works of writers such as arjun dangle shed light on the social, political, and economic conditions of dalits, both historically and in present times.
cultural studies focuses on examining the political aspects of modern culture, including its historical roots, unique characteristics, and areas of contention.
researchers in cultural studies typically explore how cultural activities intersect with broader power structures tied to social elements like ideology, class hierarchies, national identities, ethnic diversity, sexual orientation, gender, and age groups.
this field takes a critical approach by viewing cultures not as static, enclosed, unchanging, or independent units, but rather as dynamic and interconnected systems of behaviors and transformations.
cultural history merges anthropological and historical approaches to explore prevalent cultural customs and how historical experiences are interpreted within a culture.
this field analyzes historical artifacts and narratives, encompassing a chronological sequence of events extending from the past through to the present and projecting into the future within a specific cultural context.
cultural history documents and explains past human events against the background of social, cultural, and political environments, including artistic expressions and societal norms embraced by a community.
by highlighting the distinct ways of life shaped by a particular group, cultural history delves into the collective cultural practices, rituals, social classes, and the interplay with local environments that have characterized human societies throughout time.
english studies have increasingly shifted their focus towards the analysis of communicative practices, aligning with established fields like philosophy, history, and sociology.
within english departments, efforts are being made to identify effective ways of communicating with readers and creating contexts that enhance understanding.
this approach is viewed as essential for cultural historiography to adopt and refine.
emphasis is placed on the need for in-depth exploration of specific modes of communication and the historical evolution of this subject.
the study then evolves into an exploration of the history of interpretation and the constant struggle for meaning in various contexts.
its ultimate goal is to influence change by engaging scholars as active participants in the political and educational processes that shape historical narratives.
the paragraph explores catherine belsey's contributions to cultural history through her analysis as discussed in the 1980 book "critical practice." this volume introduced belsey and highlighted her key characteristics, including a fervent dedication to theoretical exploration, a firm disapproval of moralizing and empirical approaches in british criticism, and an insatiable intellectual curiosity that transcends boundaries of genre and era.
although belsey is known for her extensive writings on early modern drama, notably shakespeare, her scholarly pursuits also span various other literary figures such as john donne, john milton, conan doyle, thomas malory, alfred lord tennyson, and chretien de troyes, as well as playwrights like bertold brecht.
furthermore, her breadth of critical influences encompasses a wide array of thinkers including aristotle, sidney, kant, hegel, freud, lacan, althusser, machery, leavis, stanley fish, and saussure.
structuralism is a theoretical framework used in sociology, anthropology, linguistics, and semiotics, asserting that aspects of human culture should be analyzed in relation to a broader system or structure.
it aims to reveal the underlying structures influencing human actions, thoughts, perceptions, and emotions.
post-structuralism, on the other hand, is rooted in the idea of over-determination, a concept that may not be explicitly expressed in texts.
over-determination as an epistemological stance suggests the fusion of discourse and its subjects, blurring the line between theory and reality.
it suggests that our understanding is influenced by what we are taught, shaping our perception of reality.
post-structuralism highlights how discourse can mold our reality.
essentially, our comprehension is limited at any given time, influenced by the discourses we have assimilated, some of which may contain inaccuracies.
belsey's approach to the theoretical shift was unique in several aspects.
firstly, she addressed it from an educational perspective.
despite advocating for the occasional necessity of using complex and unfamiliar terminology in discussing intricate ideas, she consistently maintained a clear and understandable writing style that allowed undergraduates to grasp the concepts with a bit of effort.
her primary aim appeared to be to render new ideas practical and relevant, aiming to influence "critical practice," the theme she selected for her publication in the new accents series.
while others crafted elaborate linguistic constructs, belsey was focused on democratizing the wealth of theoretical contemplation for anyone interested in utilizing its resources.
i have a vivid recollection of using critical practice in my undergraduate classes, delving into discussions about the implications of substituting "subject" for "self" or questioning the inherent disparities between a "declarative" and an "interrogative" text, pondering whether they were merely diverse approaches to interpretation.
new historicism and cultural materialism are now considered two dominant and attractive movements in modern literary criticism.
these approaches, originally rooted in renaissance studies, have expanded their influence globally within english and american literary history.
a wide range of groundbreaking research has surfaced, covering works from the canterbury tales to the cantos, sparking significant theoretical debates.
this reader aims to spotlight the diversity and passionate debates within this new critical landscape.
the introduction defines the core principles of both movements, explores their theoretical foundations, and outlines their major points of agreement and contention.
the first set of essays traces the intellectual origins of new historicism and cultural materialism to influential figures such as foucault, benjamin, althusser, and derrida.
the following section presents a theoretical dialogue between leading proponents and critics of these critical approaches, featuring notable scholars like stephen greenblatt, catherine belsey, alan sinfield, and catherine gallagher.
a significant amount of recent groundbreaking historical research has been associated with a broad initiative to document history from a cultural perspective.
the essays compiled in this collection serve as an initial exploration into this emerging trend within the field of history.
those in part one delve into the foundational influences that have shaped this new approach to cultural history, drawing from the innovative works of influential figures like french cultural critic michel foucault, american anthropologist clifford geertz, and contemporary historians such as natalie davis and e.
thompson, alongside the controversial theories of hayden white and dominick lacapra.
essays in part two exemplify the intricate and rewarding new endeavors of historians in this vein, covering a wide range of subjects including 19th-century american parades, 16th-century spanish texts, english medical literature, and the visual techniques employed in italian renaissance frescoes.
despite the diverse topics addressed, a unifying thread emerges, showcasing the shared principles of this evolving cultural historical approach.
the concept of modern film emerged as an invention in the late 19th century, evolving into a full-fledged industry by the early 20th century.
prior to this era, there was no systematic exploration of film.
film studies emerged as an academic discipline focused on the theoretical aspects of film creation, rather than technical elements such as direction, cinematography, scriptwriting, and editing.
this academic field was a novel concept that gained prominence in the 20th century.
the field of film studies delves into the narrative, artistic, cultural, economic, and political dimensions of cinema.
it employs various critical methods to uncover the social and ideological values present in films by analyzing production, theoretical frameworks, context, and creative aspects.
the discipline of film studies is unique in that it allows the featured films themselves to act as primary educational tools rather than relying solely on the teacher.
potential career paths for individuals studying film include critics and filmmakers.
film theory often explores the tensions between the visual aesthetics of hollywood and the textual analysis of screenplays.
the study of film is a dynamic field that continues to expand alongside the film industry it scrutinizes.
leading academic journals that publish research in film studies include screen, cinema journal, film quarterly, and journal of film and video.
influential figures in the study of film can be broadly categorized as individuals involved in film production and those engaged in film criticism.
in the 1950s, cinema started shifting away from hollywood productions towards a more artistic and independent approach.
this transition was led by the emergence of the auteur theory, which emphasized the director as the visionary artist behind a film.
as a result, film studies began to gain academic credibility globally in the 1960s.
notably, in 1965, film critic robin wood drew parallels between alfred hitchcock's films and the intricate complexities found in shakespeare's plays.
this shift in perspective led to universities across the world showing interest in establishing dedicated film studies programs, equipped with stable enrollments, adequate budgets, and a strong focus on various humanities disciplines.
many programs integrate film studies with media and television studies, drawing knowledge from various aspects of visual production.
with advancing technologies, films now serve as a tangible tool for exploring cultures and art globally.
the field of film studies continues to evolve, leading to a diverse range of curricula focused on analyzing critical approaches in film.
while institutions may tailor their study materials, students are typically required to understand conceptual shifts in film, possess a vocabulary for analyzing film form and style, appreciate the ideological aspects of film, and recognize potential future directions and external influences on films.
despite the established presence of film studies, serious academic research specifically focusing on star studies did not emerge until the 1970s.
it is widely acknowledged that film stars play a fundamental role in shaping the meaning of a film.
consequently, the history of star studies is relatively shorter compared to other areas within the field of film studies, yet equally fruitful.
the chapter delves into the importance, influence, and significance of hollywood film stars in both present society and the contemporary hollywood film industry.
however, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current framework of hollywood stardom, a brief discussion on its origins, evolution, and the different analytical approaches applied within film studies is essential.
another significant aspect of star studies is rooted in the exploration of semiotics and ideology critique to uncover the societal importance attached to specific stars.
proponents influenced by ideology critique contend that movie stars hold a didactic role, conveying socially endorsed behaviors.
while not conventional role models, their personas play a prominent role in perpetuating ideologies.
thompson has devised a valuable method for identifying and assessing star personas effectively.
ideology can be viewed as a set of ideas that reflect the social needs of individuals, groups, classes, and cultures.
essentially, ideology encompasses a structured worldview that shapes our understanding of self-concepts and the relationships between individuals and entities like the state or any collective entity.
it encompasses belief systems and the underlying principles within these systems, even if they are ingrained and often unquestioned.
despite being aware of potential control, people may justify it by prioritizing the perceived benefits of the system over its drawbacks or by believing that the system adequately meets their needs, even if it mostly benefits others financially.
as a result, individuals essentially consent to the regulations imposed by governmental and societal structures.
movies generally portray various aspects of behavior, both negative and positive, thereby conveying a certain moral or ideological standpoint, whether overtly or subtly.
each film reflects the director's personal beliefs and values, giving preference to specific characters, institutions, and cultures from a certain ideological standpoint.
it is essential to acknowledge that films are commercial products targeted at the general audience, shaping narratives with the expectation that viewers will interpret them similarly.
films serve as a form of art influenced by market demands.
as societal values evolve, individuals must adapt or face obsolescence.
films often immortalize characters and abstract themes such as love, masculinity, individualism, myth, sacrifice, and national heroism.
furthermore, they may elevate nationalism above concepts like family and love, particularly during times of war, serving as a type of propaganda reflecting the prevailing global circumstances.
the introduction of digital technology into the film industry and cinematic practices has not only revolutionized film production but has also impacted historical, philosophical, institutional, and theoretical discussions.
the widespread digitization of cinema today needs to transcend mere technological advancements, influencing various aspects of filmmaking.
this marks an intriguing phase in cinematic discussions, prompting diverse theoretical debates and fluctuations among media critics, film historians, academics, filmmakers, and cultural theorists.
the incorporation of digital technology, whether in mainstream cinema, independent productions, or other media forms, has served as a crucial intersection that has led to a reevaluation of representational and theoretical frameworks within cinematic artistry and knowledge dissemination.
cultural scholars, film historians, media critics, film professionals, and academics have played key roles in advancing and diversifying the field of film studies.
in recent years, there has been a substantial increase in scholarly research focusing on digital cinema and other investigative approaches within film studies.
through their work, these individuals strive to create platforms for experts to revisit and reassess current areas of study, theoretical principles, and research findings in the realms of cinema and cultural analysis.
undoubtedly, the digital revolution in cinema has sparked intense debates and varying perspectives among audiences, scholars, historians, and practitioners within the film industry.
the term "digital divide" encompasses more than just the visual contrast caused by the advent of digital technology in filmmaking.
it represents a significant shift that has prompted critical evaluations from various perspectives.
the digital transformation of cinema has revolutionized how films are viewed as historical records and societal discussions.
it has become a focal point for numerous innovations, including aesthetic explorations, reevaluations of film histories, and reconsideration of traditional production methods.
scholars and professionals in the film industry must acknowledge and adapt to the digitalization of cinema to navigate and shape the future of the medium effectively.
economists are now delving into exploring the reasons behind and outcomes of financial illiteracy to comprehend the root causes of inadequate retirement planning and why many households find themselves reaching retirement age with minimal or no savings.
it has been found that a significant number of households lack even rudimentary economic knowledge necessary for sound saving and investment choices.
this lack of financial literacy is prevalent among individuals of all age groups in the united states and elsewhere, leading to significant challenges in saving, planning for retirement, managing mortgages, and other financial decisions.
consequently, governmental bodies and various non-profit organizations are launching endeavors to promote financial education.
drawing lessons from the experiences of other nations, such as japan's saving campaign and sweden's pension privatization program, provides valuable insights into the potential impact of financial literacy initiatives and saving programs.
transport systems play a crucial role in urban areas, making their sustainability essential for achieving overall urban sustainability.
currently, the evaluation of urban sustainability is a prominent topic across various scientific disciplines, despite the lack of widely accepted definitions for urban sustainability and sustainable transportation.
the use of diverse indicators to assess sustainable urban transportation has become central in urban studies.
this paper aims to review sets of sustainable urban transport indicators from global scientific literature, gather variables for evaluating urban transport sustainability in hungary, and provide recommendations to enhance the effectiveness of assessing the sustainability of transport systems in hungarian urban areas.
there has been a rise in the number of international studies that analyze sustainability indicators or develop composite indices to assess urban transport systems.
these studies have diverse aims, ranging from single-dimensional analyses to interdisciplinary approaches.
in this research, 18 studies were gathered from regions spanning north and south america, europe, and asia to collect data on sustainable urban transport and explore the correlation between climate-related and sustainability indicators in this field.
a total of 535 variables were identified from the reviewed studies, with some overlapping and others unique due to the differing objectives of the papers.
this diversity underscores a crucial urban planning principle: since cities vary in characteristics and challenges, there is a need to compile distinct variables and composite indices tailored to each city's unique context.
in fact, the final recommendation differs slightly from the others as it suggests that the main goal of sustainability assessments in various cities should not necessarily be about achieving comparability.
instead, the primary objective should be assessing the unique characteristics of each locality, such as identifying its strengths, weaknesses, barriers, and opportunities in terms of sustainability.
while using indicators specific to each location is preferable, international indicators can also be useful.
furthermore, although ensuring comparability is not the primary focus, it can still play a secondary role by helping to reveal best practices across different cities during sustainability assessments.
there is a lack of consensus regarding the definition of sustainable urban mobility and the selection of indicators to measure it.
the definitions and indicators used vary depending on the authors of different studies, leading to a lack of coherence in the indicators applied.
additionally, there is significant variation in the examined sectors and identified dimensions in transport-related studies on an urban scale.
the availability of indicators is cited as a major barrier in using sustainability indicators, as national and regional differences in explaining variables cause challenges.
many authors have noted this issue during the indicator collection phase, as highlighted in preceding sections.
nevertheless, mathematical-statistical techniques like cluster analysis, factor analysis, and correlation analysis have proven to be effective and increasingly utilized in reducing the volume of data required to evaluate the sustainability of complex systems.
these assertions hold true in hungary, where the hungarian central statistical office does not currently offer a comprehensive set of indicators for examining the transport sector's sustainability.
despite the clearly defined importance of mobility in urban sustainability, appropriate measures are lacking.
therefore, recommendations have been proposed for developing measurement methodologies; however, their execution necessitates additional scientific and financial commitments on both a national and regional level.
with the exception of their artistic usage, words act as surrogates for real experiences, guiding us towards an understanding of what the words aim to convey.
they function as prompts, steering us towards various experiences akin to navigating a journey.
the effectiveness of these cues lies in their capacity to assist us in anticipating the scenarios we aim to either confront or evade.
the significance of deliteralizing knowledge lies in its capacity to allow for various ways of understanding.
while some assertions can be objectively tested using scientific methods, there are also expressions and visuals that aim to evoke feelings associated with their subjects.
photographs serve as potent tools for presenting what words sometimes cannot convey.
renowned photographers like edward steichen, dorothea lange, and paul strand exemplify this skill in capturing the essence of their subjects in the 20th century.
however, this ability to unveil truths is not exclusive to these artists but is also attainable for individuals with lesser-known photographic talents.
the key point is that humans have developed diverse forms of representation within cultural contexts, encompassing visual, auditory, gustatory, kinesthetic elements, and even combinations thereof.
let's briefly differentiate between the descriptive and evocative aspects.
descriptive elements aim to establish a direct correlation between words and actions, while the evocative seeks to evoke emotions and create a resonant experience for viewers or readers, whether through visual, linguistic, choreographic, or musical means.
emotion and imagination play key roles in both.
in research, prioritizing evocative aspects, even within descriptive sections, is vital.
in essence, art in research becomes apparent when it allows viewers to immerse themselves vicariously in a scenario.
it's fascinating to observe how our language is filled with metaphors to depict our emotions.
we use expressions like feeling high or low, being bright or dull, slow or swift to articulate our feelings.
these metaphors not only describe our characteristics but also help others comprehend our emotions and aid us in recognizing our internal states.
when discussing arts-informed research, it is crucial to consider the distinct characteristics of the art form or forms being utilized.
for instance, unlike realism in visual arts that can depict detailed representations, music lacks the same referential qualities.
while a realist painting can capture a person's likeness or a place's atmosphere, music does not offer an equivalent direct representation.
even program music, like the william tell overture, is not as explicitly referential as photo realistic art.
some art forms, such as opera or theatre, blend various elements.
stage productions may incorporate color, light, speech, and music, creating synthetic art forms with diverse research potential.
understanding these nuances is essential for effective research planning in arts-informed studies.
given the vast diversity in features and research potential of various art forms, a valid question arises: what common ground unites them under the label of "art"?
in my view, the key factor that binds these art forms together is their shared objective of conveying expressiveness through skillfully crafted forms.
throughout history, the arts have consistently aimed to elicit emotions, often acting as a source of both elevation and melancholy.
the spectrum of emotional reactions provoked by artistic pieces is wide-ranging.
these emotional responses tint the subject matter with the particular shades of emotion imbued within the artistically constructed form.
through art, we often experience what is beyond visible perception.
as a result, they started to consider only empirical propositions that could potentially be verified using scientific methodologies as meaningful.
i personally find this viewpoint excessively limiting when it comes to the necessary research criteria in the social sciences.
if we acknowledge that our knowledge exceeds our ability to articulate it, then we should strive to communicate what we know using any means available to convey the message effectively.
it might be overly optimistic to anticipate that an individual lacking expertise, particularly in visual arts, could generate arts-informed research of the caliber required for a doctoral degree.
i personally believe that this kind of work should be underpinned by a solid theoretical or conceptual framework and demonstrate a high level of artistic refinement, as i previously highlighted.
it is precisely in this context of varied proficiencies that arts-informed research presents a greater level of complexity, rather than simplicity, compared to conventional research methodologies in the social sciences.
is there a future for arts-informed research?
speculation arises regarding the conditions necessary for its development.
an essential factor is the dedication of individuals embracing the arts to enhance human comprehension.
the arts are increasingly valued as research tools, likely inviting various forms of resistance.
scholars embracing arts-informed research must adeptly tackle these challenges.
it is unlikely that short-term enthusiasts possess the needed leadership and courage for this endeavor.
establishing supportive environments within universities for aspiring scholars keen on arts-informed research is vital.
the media lab at mit exemplifies an innovative approach to research exploration.
academics have the potential to consolidate various ideas within concepts of significance and communication, technical aspects, and theoretical knowledge, which can enhance the environment and result in truly extraordinary outcomes.
encouraging such collaborations will necessitate a reevaluation of the conventional promotion criteria predominantly utilized in american universities, particularly in research institutions.
traditionally, solo achievements are expected before tenure, whereas in fields like physics, collaboration is common and essential.
for instance, the stanford linear accelerator is utilized by individuals worldwide in partnership with physicists from stanford university.
this illustrates a shift towards a more interconnected, interdisciplinary, and cooperative approach to research, emphasizing that knowledge creation is inherently social.
in this chapter, the arts serve as a reflection of our ability to engage with the emotional reactions that art can elicit.
at its core, art is centered on evoking feelings and tapping into our emotions.
acknowledging our emotional depth is a means of uncovering our shared humanity.
art provides a pathway to explore our individual, internal emotions, allowing us to delve into our personal emotional realms.
this process is crucial in helping us understand our own emotional landscapes, marking a significant milestone.
the various procedures i have elucidated all play a role in enhancing human comprehension.
it is only through our deliberate choice or the influence of others that we can consider such conditions, characteristics, or emotions.
we gain insights into the world through multiple avenues, with the arts being one of them.
the substantial absence of the arts in the methodology of educational research is a notable limitation in comprehending activities in classrooms, schools, conferences, and homes.
engaging with the arts helps elevate our consciousness and broaden our humanity, which is a favorable outcome for such a crucial yet intricate process.
whenever a woman prays or prophesies without her head covering, she brings dishonor to her head—it is as disgraceful as having her head shaved.
if a woman refuses to cover her head, she might as well have her hair cut off; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved, she should cover her head.
a man, on the other hand, should not cover his head because he reflects the image and glory of god.
but the woman reflects the glory of man.
for the first man, adam, was not made from eve, but eve came from adam.
and man was not made for woman, but woman was made for man.
this is why a woman should have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.
the interplay among social connotations, courtly style, and commercial trends becomes more nuanced as we transition from discussing headwear to accessories, offering a fresh perspective to explore these dynamics.
accessories like gloves and fans prominently feature in numerous portraits from the sixteenth century, both full-length and half-length.
while some of their portrayal adhered to artistic conventions, the sheer prevalence of these items in both artwork and inventories, where they were frequently appraised at high worth, underscores their significance in reflecting social status and fashion trends of the time.
the coming together symbolized a tangible educational environment where learning opportunities were equally accessible to everyone involved.
this educational setting presented a chance for revolutionary learning, offering insights to those with access.
the spy believed that advocating for this radical educational approach led to the early termination of research activities, as it prompted shifts in work behaviors that ultimately led the general manager to expel the spy from the group.
a case in point is the online word processing functionality provided by google docs.
while it is possible to transmit microsoft word documents online, google docs sets itself apart by not requiring the document and software to be stored locally.
instead, the data and code are saved in the cloud utilizing remote server farms with shared processors and memory.
this arrangement is advantageous as it eliminates concerns regarding maintenance, disruptions, and software or hardware upgrades.
additionally, operating in the cloud enables economies of scale and simplifies data sharing among applications and users.
utilizing vast datasets plays a crucial role in enhancing machine learning capabilities, particularly evident in the field of computer vision.
noteworthy large-scale image datasets like imagenet and pascal visual object classes dataset have significantly contributed to advancements in object and scene recognition.
a study by lai et al.
showcased how trimble's sketchup 3d warehouse minimized the necessity for labor-intensive manual labeling of training data.
innovatively developed an augmented reality application by harnessing community photo collections processed in the cloud.
demonstrated a robust object learning approach by amalgamating internet images with input from a local human operator.
deep learning, employing multi-layered neural networks, is a powerful technique well-suited for handling big data extensively utilized in computer vision applications, including grasping tasks.
the core challenge in robotics and automation lies in dealing with uncertainty surrounding sensing, models, and control.
this uncertainty typically manifests as variations in position, orientation, shape, and control inputs.
employing cloud computing is particularly advantageous for conducting sample-based monte carlo analyses.
one practical application is using parallel cloud computing to predict the effects of numerous potential perturbations in the object and environment configurations on the robot's performance relative to sensor inputs and commands.
this innovative approach is currently under investigation in medical fields and particle physics.
the robotics and automation community widely recognizes the success of open source software in this field, with ros, the robot operating system, being a primary example.
ros offers libraries and tools that support software developers in creating robot applications and has even been adapted for use on android devices.
like linux, ros has risen to become a standard tool used by a vast majority of researchers and many industry professionals.
to assist these users, the ros industrial project was established.
the authors express gratitude to c.
wiegley for their continuous insights and guidance on this subject.
furthermore, their findings did not reveal any indication that hydration led to an improvement in the arrangement of water molecules around the solute.
instead, the hydrogen-bonded network appeared to uphold its configuration by aligning water molecules so that the o-h bonds run parallel to the solute surface.
the presence of these orientational effects does not contradict the absence of any structure enhancement, as it is essential to recognize that the hydrogen-bonded network imposes directional tendencies in the orientation of nearby water molecules even in the larger surrounding environment.
although there may still be a fluid layer present between the solute surfaces, its density is notably lower than that of the surrounding liquid.
despite not being completely dried, this scenario still demonstrates powerful hydrophobic forces, indicating that total dehydration is not necessary to facilitate an appealing interaction.
the impact on water dynamics in a hydrophobic depletion layer remains a less explored subject.
dokter and colleagues (103) observed sluggish orientational dynamics and reduced mobility of water molecules in the interfacial layer of nanodroplets in reverse micelles, where the interface is believed to have reduced hydrogen bonding despite not being hydrophobic.
noted delayed dynamics in water simulations adjacent to a hydrophobic surface.
the paragraph suggests that alterations in rotational dynamics in this area could significantly affect the hydrophobic interaction itself.
according to the proposal, correlated fluctuations in charge or dipoles on both surfaces could result in an electrostatic interaction that extends over long distances, without directly involving the structure of water itself.
more recently, despa and berry have further developed this idea by examining the impact of the observable alignment of water molecules near hydrophobic surfaces and the subsequent slowing down of relaxation processes.
they argue that the reduced reorientation of water dipoles at the surface will lead to a close relationship and correlations among them, generating a polarization field that induces a dipole on the hydrophobic surface.
from this perspective, the long-range attraction between two such surfaces is primarily electrostatic in nature, stemming from induced dipole-dipole interactions.
bubble coalescence is thought to be affected by a long-range interaction between hydrophobic surfaces and can be hindered by certain ions in a selective manner, as some combinations of anions and cations exhibit this effect while others do not.
the phenomenon is quite puzzling, and currently lacks a clear explanation.
despite the general understanding that salts typically lower water surface tension and therefore reduce coalescence, the observation that some electrolytes do not follow this pattern remains unexplained.
have proposed that coalescence might be influenced by the long-range hydrophobic attraction, which could be altered by salts in an ion-specific manner associated with hofmeister effects.
they suggest considering the possibility that the reduction of long-range attraction in the presence of certain salts, like kbr and mgso4, could be explained by the impact of salts on bubble coalescence rather than vice versa, thus offering an alternative perspective on the issue.
atomistic simulations of the folding process of the sh3 protein domain have indicated a gradual removal of water molecules from the collapsed interior.
these simulations suggest that folding occurs in two stages: initially, a collapse to a structure closely resembling the native state while retaining some hydrated hydrophobic core, followed by a slower expulsion of the remaining water.
this residual water may act as a lubricant to facilitate the optimal packing of the hydrophobic core.
it is noted that some water molecules tend to remain within the core, forming hydrogen bonds with the peptide backbone.
nmr data supports the idea that the sh3 domain of the drk protein in drosophila may assume a collapsed yet loosely structured conformation.
this challenges the earlier notion proposed by lum et al.
and ten wolde and chandler of a sudden, collective drying transition when water is constrained between primarily hydrophobic surfaces.
the presence of distinct water-binding sites on a protein's surface may not always indicate their occupation by water molecules.
in a study by makarov et al.
in 212, it was observed that while numerous such sites were identifiable in myoglobin simulations, roughly only half of them were typically filled at any given moment.
this led to the suggestion that a detailed representation of firmly bound waters on a protein's surface might not always be suitable, advocating instead for a continuous density distribution model of hydration waters.
additionally, the duration for which water molecules remain in specific hydration sites does not appear to correlate straightforwardly with the characteristics of the interacting residue, such as its polarity or hydrogen-bonding capability.
in the research conducted by makarov et al., it was noted that these durations mainly relied on the protein surface's geometry.
hydration waters with extended residency times were primarily situated in clefts and cavities, pointing to steric hindrance as a crucial determinant impeding diffusion.
considering that hydration water likely plays a role in stimulating protein dynamics through liquid-state fluctuations, it prompts the question of whether there are unique properties of water facilitating this phenomenon, given that fluctuations are present in various liquids.
specifically, is water distinct in a way that sets apart the dynamics of the hydration shell from a solvation layer in a basic liquid, potentially due to cooperative influences from its network of hydrogen bonds?
furthermore, how do these fluctuations in the hydration shell compare with those in the bulk liquid, and to what extent do features like hydrogen bonding impact its interaction with the protein?
in essence, the connection between two proteins through water molecules is more than just a physical bridge.
these interactions contain valuable information that helps in discerning between different interactions.
consequently, protein surfaces expand their reach through their hydration layers.
the effectiveness of these interactions facilitated by water is heightened in cases of two oppositely charged entities, like an acid-base duo.
here, the favorable coulombic interaction of a direct contact is balanced by a substantial gibbs energy cost associated with fully desolvating the charges needed for such a connection.
shifting the positioning of tethered water molecules has been identified as a key element in protein-carbohydrate interactions, with the common focus being on removing loosely attached, disorganized water molecules from the protein surface.
this process yields advantages in terms of both energy (enthalpic) and disorder (entropic) when these molecules revert to their liquid state.
discovered that the elimination of structured water from the binding site can lead to nuanced changes in substrate preference during such interactions, hinging on a fragile equilibrium between entropic and enthalpic influences.
in a broader sense, the release of bound water upon ligand binding is commonly evaluated using scoring functions that aim to assess how specific recognition patterns influence binding affinity.
friesner and colleagues have noted that these scoring methods may not effectively capture the impact of two specific motifs: strongly hydrophobic cavities containing water clusters and the formation of hydrogen bonds within sites surrounded by hydrophobic groups.
young and team have demonstrated that the hydration status of these binding cavities is significantly disrupted in such scenarios, resulting in considerable entropic and enthalpic consequences that stabilize the protein-ligand complex.
this phenomenon explains, for instance, the high binding affinity observed in the streptavidin-biotin interaction.
suggest that targeting these motifs could be valuable in drug development initiatives.
a similar phenomenon can be observed in how oxygen binds to hemoglobin through allosteric regulation.
the hemoglobin found in the mollusk scapharca inaequivalvis exists as a dimer, with a cluster of 17 specifically positioned water molecules within the subunit interface.
unlike mammalian hemoglobin, where changes in the overall structure bring about oxygen binding cooperativity, in scapharca's hemoglobin, this cooperativity arises from more nuanced structural adjustments.
notably, as oxygen binds, six of these water molecules lose their ordered arrangement, indicating their crucial role in facilitating cooperative oxygen binding.
(306), these water molecules serve as a crucial link for allosteric communication between subunits, playing a pivotal role in stabilizing the protein's low-affinity state.
conversely, a mutant form lacking two hydrogen bonds within this water cluster tends to favor the high-affinity conformation instead.
numerous proteins feature hydrophobic pockets within their structures that may not be completely devoid of water or repellent to it.
during a high-pressure crystallographic examination of a t4 lysozyme mutant with a notably hydrophobic cavity, collins and colleagues (307) observed that a modest increase in pressure allowed four water molecules to infiltrate the cavity.
furthermore, they noted that the energetic cost of filling these cavities could be minimal or non-existent.
the researchers proposed that this phenomenon could play a role in the pressure-driven unfolding of many proteins.
researchers have modeled one-dimensional proton wires by examining the water-filled hydrophobic channels of carbon nanotubes.
(2003) used ab initio molecular dynamics calculations to show that proton mobility along such water chains inside a nanotube can be significantly boosted by the structure imposed by confinement, potentially reaching levels approximately 40 times higher than in bulk water under ideal conditions without hydrogen-bonding defects.
this outcome aligns with prior predictions made by brewer and colleagues, who observed increased proton diffusion within narrow, smooth, cylindrical hydrophobic pores.
the confinement effect leads to enhanced mobility through the alignment of water molecules into a one-dimensional proton wire and by obstructing the stabilization of the protonated center via hydration.
(2017) demonstrated that the explanation for this phenomenon involves three main factors contributing to the free-energy barrier for proton transport: the bipolar field, electrostatic repulsion by arg-195, and the dehydration penalty due to the pore's narrow neck.
the authors found that the bipolar field accounts for approximately half of the gibbs energy barrier for proton permeation.
remarkably, the unique ability of protons to delocalize their charge in zundel-type configurations does not seem to significantly reduce this barrier compared to other cations.
this emphasis on the role of electrostatics in gating was corroborated by simulations of water flow in a carbon nanotube.
specifically, introducing a positive charge at the nanotube's midpoint and just outside its wall could lead to the reorientation of water molecules into an l defect formation as they pass through the tube in a single-file manner.
while experimental evidence as well as theoretical support suggest the existence of cation ions in the minor groove, a study by chiu et al.
raises doubts regarding the concept of sequence-specific ion-binding sites and their impact on altering dna structure.
they propose that short-ranged interactions between nucleotide bases might be responsible for sequence-dependent variations in local structure instead.
the debate is ongoing; while md simulations by hamelberg et al.
indicate that interactions of ions and water in the minor groove constrict its width, findings by ponomarev et al.
suggest no significant correlations between groove width and the presence of ions.
the original statement was intentionally provocative, aiming to not only draw attention to translation studies but also to suggest that comparative literature was obsolete.
however, in hindsight, this assertion seems flawed.
translation studies have not progressed significantly in the last thirty years, and the act of comparison remains central to much of the scholarly work in translation studies.
if i were to rewrite the book today, i would argue that both comparative literature and translation studies should not be viewed as distinct disciplines but rather as methods for approaching literature, complementary ways of interpretation.
the crisis in comparative literature arose from excessive adherence to set rules, coupled with culturally specific methodologies that were not universally applicable or relevant.
spivak challenges the idea of globalisation and instead proposes the concept of planetarity, while acknowledging that the discourse surrounding global flows can offer valuable insights for comparatists.
she suggests that the various exchanges and transitions within literary and philosophical movements can be likened to the dynamic shifts observed in global information flows.
this perspective highlights the potential for utilizing theories of cultural capital and its dissemination as an effective comparative approach.
furthermore, she underscores the value of commemorating specific events that unite scholars from diverse fields, emphasizing the benefits of collaborative research.
a notable example is the interdisciplinary conference held in lisbon in november 2005, which marked the 250th anniversary of the earthquake that devastated the city on all saints day in 1755 and exemplified a successful blending of interdisciplinary studies and comparativism.
the poems had a significant impact, serving as role models for a new generation of poets grappling with portraying war horrors in poetry.
they also set a standard for future translators by shaping english-language readers' perceptions of the potential of chinese poetry.
comparative literature scholars aim to analyze these poems within a context and juxtapose them with contemporary war poetry.
cathay is particularly interesting as it demonstrates how translation can drive literary rejuvenation and creativity.
this illustrates the valuable contribution of translation studies to comparative literature, emphasizing the crucial role translation plays in literary evolution.
it is now recognized that periods of notable literary innovation are often preceded by periods of substantial translation activity, marking a shift from viewing translation as a peripheral aspect of comparative literature to acknowledging its pivotal importance in literary history.
in the 1920s, kemal ataturk spearheaded the turkish modernization initiative with a significant focus on systematically translating fundamental western culture texts.
the act of translation not only introduces fresh concepts, genres, and forms but it is surprising that for a considerable period, research into the history of translation was not duly recognized within the realm of comparative literature as an academic discipline.
the future of comparative literature hinges on abandoning endeavors to rigidly define the subject matter and instead focusing on the concept of literature in its most expansive context.
it involves acknowledging the interconnectedness that arises from the exchange of literary works.
it is not viable to study any single european literature in isolation, and european scholars should be open to reevaluating the heritage they have been bequeathed.
valuable insights can be gained from the perspectives of scholars from the southern hemisphere, particularly the fresh angles their viewpoints prompt.
however, it is crucial not to overlook our position as europeans within our literary narrative.
this narrative underscores the importance of translation as a fundamental conduit for the transmission of knowledge, thereby underscoring the necessity of giving translation history a central role in any study of comparative literature.
authors, being consistently ahead of literary critics by approximately twenty years, are increasingly revisiting literature from earlier periods across europe.
they are actively involving themselves with it, reworking it, and employing it as a tool to explore the world around them.
it is hoped that scholars of literature will trail behind authors and forsake fruitless discussions on terms and meanings, directing their attention more effectively towards analyzing texts.
this involves tracing the evolution of writing and reading through various cultures and time periods.
this article emphasizes the importance of counseling psychology researchers disclosing how they handle missing data in their reports.
without understanding the extent and pattern of missing data or the methods used to address them, research consumers cannot accurately interpret study findings.
the article examines various patterns of missing data and discusses common strategies for addressing them.
through a simulation study, the authors compare three methods for handling missing data: mean substitution, multiple imputation, and full information maximum likelihood.
the results indicate that mean substitution is an inadequate approach, while both multiple imputation and full information maximum likelihood are recommended alternatives.
the authors recommend that researchers transparently report the extent and pattern of missing data, as well as their chosen data handling methods in counseling psychology research, with editors encouraged to enforce this practice.
in three articles, missing data was not addressed explicitly, although the tables implied that all participants were included in the analyses.
one article omitted participant numbers in the tables and made no mention of missing data in the text, raising doubts about whether every participant completed all measures.
another article did not discuss missing data in the text, but the tables indicated its presence.
one study employed median replacement for missing data, using regression imputation when faced with a high number of missing data points on a variable, without providing a rationale for these choices.
finally, in a separate article, missing values were deleted pairwise without justification.
a supplementary control algorithm has been incorporated to engage the yaw brake when the nacelle reaches the intended position.
whenever the yaw reference is adjusted, the brake is disengaged, and the pi controller guarantees that the nacelle yaws towards the new position.
in addition to fixed yaw references, the yaw controller can also facilitate smooth yaw movements, like a customizable harmonic pattern with adjustable amplitude and frequency.
this kind of movement can be beneficial for wind farm control strategies or for creating wake meandering effects in wind tunnel experiments.
in this study, we investigate the main factors influencing changes in global energy consumption over the last forty years.
our econometric method is resilient against unit roots, unrecorded time influences, and spatial influences.
we analyze both strong decoupling, in which economic expansion has a decreasing impact on energy consumption with rising incomes, and weak decoupling, where energy usage decreases in wealthier nations over time, all else being equal.
our main discoveries indicate that the rise in per capita energy consumption is predominantly propelled by economic growth, a convergence in energy efficiency, and weak decoupling.
strong decoupling does not appear to be present in our findings.
parental resistance or the perception of resistance from teachers and school staff may arise due to various factors.
parents often find it challenging to discuss mental health issues openly with schools, leading to uncertainties about sharing details regarding their home life during challenging times.
additionally, obstacles such as physical distance between home and school, as well as time constraints, can hinder effective communication and collaboration between families and schools.
barriers often exist between parents and healthcare providers.
oftentimes, parents come into treatment scenarios with minimal understanding of medication and therapy choices for their children.
this disparity in expectations between parents and physicians can result in communication breakdowns.
parents may struggle to engage with the physician due to uncertainties about the decision to medicate their children or even uncertainties about seeking medical assistance in general.
similarly to parent-school interactions, geographical distance and time constraints can hinder effective collaboration between parents and healthcare providers.
for decades, abstract computationalism has stood as the predominant perspective on cognition, despite occasional reports of its decline being overstated.
this essay examines recent literature on computationalism and draws the following conclusions: computationalism encompasses various theories regarding cognitive mechanisms, with neuroscience providing primary evidence for testing these theories, supported by the contributions of psychology and ai.
the diverse versions of computationalism influence ongoing research in the philosophy of mind, psychology, and neuroscience.
while our comprehension of computationalism has advanced, significant work in this field still lies ahead.
the concept of computationalism is particularly intriguing when it demonstrates explanatory capabilities.
the most pertinent and enlightening understanding of computation is linked to digital computers, which execute remarkable tasks such as solving mathematical quandaries, engaging in complex games, and validating logical theorems.
it is plausible that cognitive systems function akin to computers.
initially, the resemblance between computers and cognitive systems served as the primary rationale behind computationalism.
this form of computationalism is a robust proposition that warrants empirical assessment.
to delve deeper into this concept, it is beneficial to retrospect historically.
i appreciate the generous support provided by the gladys krieble delmas foundation, the samuel h.
kress foundation, the cosmos club foundation, and the p.
sisterhood, which enabled me to conduct essential research for this project in venice.
additionally, i extend my gratitude to kim butler, anthony colantuono, and colette crossman for their meticulous and beneficial feedback on earlier versions of this manuscript, as well as to the reviewers for their insightful recommendations.
although altars were not commonly found in venetian homes, many households owned objects similar to those used during the eucharist, such as linens, candles, plates, and goblets.
by combining everyday household items and furniture with spiritually significant images and objects, a makeshift altar could be created in these households.
during the cinquecento, the continuous and growing prevalence of religious items in households in venice serves as evidence to the unwavering faith of the local population.
the extensive presence of preventive sacred images and items documented in household registers suggests that comparable principles of religious devotion were relevant within the domestic sphere.
these sacred representations served as safeguards for households and their occupants, shielding the faithful from harm, disease, and untimely demise - an outcome dreaded for its lack of opportunity for confession, last rites, and the looming specter of purgatory.

while some advocate for abandoning the idea of sustainable development, claiming it lacks clear economic value and is too vague to be practical, it is crucial to consider that significant concepts, such as democracy, justice, and welfare, defy precise definitions.
unlike analytic concepts that adhere strictly to the law of contradiction where something cannot be both a and non-a simultaneously, dialectical concepts evolve and possess overlapping characteristics with their "other." this interplay allows for a nuanced understanding; for instance, entities like an age, a tidal salt marsh, or a credit card can embody contradictory elements, like being both young and old or both land and sea.
by embracing dialectical concepts that accommodate change and evolution, we acknowledge the complexity and fluidity of our world, enabling progress and adaptation in our understanding and approach to various issues.
the classical economists believed that the economy would naturally reach a stationary state where wages would be at a subsistence level, and all surplus would be accrued by landlords as rent, leaving no room for capitalist profit and thus no incentive for further growth.
while many of these economists viewed the stationary state as the end of progress, mill saw it differently, understanding that it did not mean a halt in human advancement.
he believed that in a stationary state, there would be a greater focus on refining the quality of life rather than just economic advancement.
unlike his contemporaries, mill argued that production laws did not rigidly determine distribution, negating the necessity of subsistence-level wages in the stationary state.
essentially, mill advocated for sustainable development without conventional growth, emphasizing qualitative improvements over quantitative increases.
however, despite mill's insights on the stationary state, his views were largely overlooked by subsequent economists.
could such expansion potentially deplete the earth's ecological capacity to sustain life in the future?
this is a valid concern as some economic models view this "liquidation" process as "optimal".
despite some models acknowledging ecological costs, they may still advocate for liquidation for the sake of present value maximization.
the higher the discount rate, the quicker the liquidation may occur.
this concept can raise unease among some neoclassical economists, though not always.
it is commonly assumed that replacing natural resources with additional manmade capital is a viable solution.
however, reality is prompting a reassessment of these models, particularly at institutions like the world bank, which employs a large number of economists globally.
the world bank is well positioned to acknowledge the ecological contradictions present in the global economic development strategies and to underscore the necessity for developed nations to limit resource consumption.
this is crucial to ensure that there is enough ecological space left for the growth required to meet the essential needs of people in developing countries.
by setting an example of sustainable development that can be applied broadly, the north can pave the way for a more balanced growth approach.
one significant opportunity for the world bank to address these issues was presented in its 1992 world development report titled development and the environment.
during this period, i was part of the environment department at the world bank.
while i was not directly involved in producing the report, i did have the chance to provide feedback on early versions and closely observe the overall process.
despite its valuable contributions in raising awareness about the public health risks posed by water and air pollution, the 1992 report failed to address a crucial issue.
it maintained that environmental degradation was largely a result of poverty and advocated for a growth-oriented solution similar to the world bank's approach to economic challenges.
this strategy emphasized the need for growth not only in developing countries but also in developed nations, as the former relied on exporting to and receiving investments from the latter.
while the report did recognize some conflicts between economic growth and environmental sustainability, it generally portrayed the situation as offering numerous mutually beneficial opportunities to enhance growth and protect the environment simultaneously.
the transformation of the manuscript for development and the environment is quite revealing.
in its early stages, there was a diagram titled "the relationship between the economy and the environment." this diagram depicted a square labeled "economy" with an arrow marked as "inputs" entering and another arrow labeled "outputs" exiting, with no mention of the environment.
i pointed out the omission of the environment in the picture and recommended adding a larger box around the existing one to represent the environment.
this adjustment would effectively illustrate the relationship between the economy and the environment, emphasizing that the economy is a subsystem dependent on the environment for raw materials as inputs and as a 'sink' for waste outputs.
upon reflecting on these two experiences, it has become clear to me that the fundamental issue in the sustainable development debate is indeed centered around what economist joseph schumpeter famously termed "preanalytic vision." my preanalytic vision of the economy as a subsystem immediately raises inquiries such as the relative size of the subsystem compared to the total system, its capacity without disrupting the overall system's functionality, the ideal size it should attain, and the optimal scale at which further growth would become counterproductive and costlier than beneficial.
the chief economist of the world bank avoided engaging with these challenging questions, choosing instead to dismiss the perspective that prompted them.
today, we seem to have reached a critical juncture.
however, the world bank is not in a position to assert this conclusively, at least not yet, as it cannot concede to the concept of growth limitations.
growth is currently perceived as the primary solution to alleviating poverty.
while historically this perspective holds merit, it is imperative to acknowledge the physical and economic constraints that growth is beginning to present, where the costs may outweigh the benefits.
in light of these limitations, the challenge is then posed: how do we uplift impoverished communities?
the straightforward answer lies in population management, wealth and income redistribution, and enhancing resource efficiency through technological advancements.
in essence, progress hinges not on growth but on development.
regrettably, within many spheres, the notions of population control and redistribution are deemed politically infeasible.
while the idea of improving resource efficiency is appealing initially, it often clashes with the goals of capital and labor productivity.
this conflict is exacerbated by the realization that in developed nations, the pursuit of high productivity and incomes for capital and labor has been attained at the expense of resource efficiency, perpetuating a cycle of resource wastage.
at the conclusion, the world bank's publication titled development and the environment failed to address a crucial inquiry: is it advantageous or detrimental for countries in the south if those in the north persist in escalating their resource consumption?
the conventional belief asserts that it is beneficial because northern expansion boosts demands for southern exports, along with providing funds for aid and investments in the south.
conversely, an opposing perspective posits that northern expansion exacerbates issues by depleting the remaining resources and ecological capacity necessary to sustain economic progress in the south at a sufficient scale.
moreover, it is argued that this trend amplifies global income disparities and international political tensions.
this standpoint advocates for development in the north without further growth.
these conflicting responses to the central query cannot both be correct.
the failure to explore this fundamental issue in the world bank's policy research highlights a deficiency in both courage and intellectual depth, indicating a persistent refusal to acknowledge limitations on growth.
although the right to peaceful assembly is beneficial, it may not be appropriate to encompass all positive elements within the concept of sustainable development.
the term had become so popular that individuals believed that their preferred causes had to be integrated into the definition to avoid being overlooked.
this confusion was further fueled by some individuals in the bank who aimed to keep the concept ambiguous, thereby preventing it from challenging the status quo of promoting loans in favor of export-driven growth and worldwide integration.
naturally, i consider the possibility that orthodox economists could be correct, and that dissenting viewpoints like mine may have misconstrued the situation.
therefore, i do make an effort occasionally to examine issues through the lens of their initial perspective and that of others.
it is a challenge to diverge from my ingrained perspectives, much like growth economists likely experience.
nonetheless, i would like to offer some insights into different approaches for merging economics and ecology, for connecting the sub-system to the whole system.
i think there are three different approaches that have been deliberated in the public domain to integrate the economy and the ecosystem.
the first method is termed "economic imperialism," where the economy subsystem grows to encompass everything.
in this scenario, the economy becomes synonymous with the entire system, treating everything as part of the economy with a monetary value attached.
the concept of internalizing externalities is taken to the extreme, leaving nothing external to the economic realm.
this perspective appears to align with the underlying approach of neoclassical economics.
the second approach involves minimizing the boundaries of the economy until it becomes indistinguishable from the ecosystem, a concept referred to as ecological reductionism.
this theory posits that all human evaluations and decisions can be attributed to the same evolutionary principles of chance and necessity that are believed to regulate the natural world.
values are determined by the amount of embodied energy, and both economies and ecosystems are influenced by the imperatives of survival.
some individuals take this stance to its extreme by considering human extinction to be of no greater consequence than the extinction of any other species.
many biologists and ecologists who adhere to a philosophy of scientific materialism seem to adopt or at least emulate this perspective.
the third strategy involves considering the economy as a part of the ecosystem and acknowledging that, although it must abide by natural laws, it cannot be solely explained by them.
the human economy is distinct from a natural system as there is more to valuing things than just their energy or survival benefits.
likewise, the economy cannot exert full control over the entire natural system by efficiently allocating resources.
envisioning earth as a meticulously managed terrarium, where everything is transformed into its highest human utility value, is a dangerous notion.
it is crucial to establish a clear boundary between the economy and the natural system, avoiding either overexpansion or collapse of this boundary to ensure that essential distinctions are preserved.
thus, the boundary must be carefully defined to include or exclude the appropriate elements.
the council should be lauded for developing an initial set of principles and seeking feedback, despite the fact that the list contains fifteen principles when likely only two or three would have been sufficient, which may diminish confidence.
achieving consensus on such a complex matter within a diverse committee – which intentionally includes members from various interest groups – is challenging.
often, reaching agreement on a principle involves simplifying it to avoid disagreements.
this can lead to an increasing need to introduce more principles with less content.
yet, the council managed to present some principles that, while not entirely clear and precise, are not devoid of meaning.
although some may seem vague or repetitive, this presents an opportunity for citizens to contribute additional specifics and substance to enrich the dialogue further.
i will now present each of the fifteen principles, along with a brief commentary intended to enhance their specificity and clarity.
while my comments may not always align with unanimous agreement due to the increased level of detail provided, it is crucial to maintain these principles as the foundational structure for our discussion.
this approach allows us to appreciate the current level of consensus and comprehension, recognizing its limitations, and prevents any misinterpretation that may arise from condensing or summarizing them.
additionally, references to subsequent chapters in the book pertaining to certain principles serve to complement the introductory purpose of this essay.
the market should indeed be the primary mechanism for addressing the issue of efficiently allocating resources.
however, before the market can effectively operate in this capacity, two key challenges must be addressed through political means.
firstly, there is a necessity to establish political and social constraints on the overall extraction of key resources to ensure sustainability.
this sets a sustainable limit on resource utilization.
secondly, the rights to exploit or contaminate resources up to this sustainable limit must transition from being freely accessible to being considered valuable assets.
determining the rightful ownership of these assets requires a fair social agreement.
only after resolving these fundamental questions regarding sustainability and equity can the market, operating in an individualistic manner, effectively tackle the challenge of efficient resource allocation.
while the market can be utilized to address allocation concerns, it is incapable of resolving issues related to scale and distribution independently.
it is essential to ensure that the statement reflects the following: ".
to support its residents with a per capita wealth that enables a satisfactory standard of living." while the definition of a "satisfactory standard of living" may vary, malthus suggested it should afford individuals the ability to have a glass of wine and a piece of meat with their meals.
this standard of prosperity is considered desirable even for those who do not drink alcohol or eat meat, and would, in itself, necessitate a decrease in populations that are currently at or above today's level.
the primary focus should be on stabilizing total consumption, which is a product of the population multiplied by the per capita consumption.
both population growth and individual consumption levels must be curbed.
the effective management of population and consumption will be conducted at the national level rather than globally.
different nations will have varying approaches: some may not regulate either population or consumption, while others will implement control measures.
among those regulating total consumption, some may prioritize high per capita consumption and low population, while others may choose the opposite.
the implementation of free migration or unrestricted trade with capital movement can undermine national efforts to control consumption and population growth.
the current trend towards economic globalization is likely to hinder sustainable development unless there is a move towards world governance, which may not be well-received.
a successful national model that others can follow could be the most beneficial contribution a nation can offer towards global sustainable development.
ensuring that future generations have a wide array of choices available is a key element of sustainable development.
however, achieving this objective cannot be accomplished solely through isolated, individualistic assessments of the impact of microeconomic and environmental choices on the future.
preserving future options requires a broader, societal approach that involves macro-level decisions, such as implementing policies to restrict the overall scale of resource consumption.
while it is important to encourage individuals to consider the needs of future generations in their personal economic choices, this alone is not adequate to address the issue effectively.
unwavering uncertainty regarding the environmental impacts of emerging technologies or substances translate into tangible economic ramifications.
these costs, akin to others, ought to be factored into the pricing and should be borne by the consumer utilizing the product that has caused the expense, instead of shifting the burden onto the broader populace.
one way to achieve this more effectively could be by mandating an assurance bond equal to the potential damage, to be issued upfront and subsequently refunded as experience diminishes uncertainties about the damage.
currently, the weight of uncertainty is disproportionately carried by the general public.
our existing liability regulations only take effect post-incident, often leading to difficulties in settling dues.
indeed, adjustments have been proposed for the fifteen principles outlined here in my feedback.
although there may be a requirement for changes in behavior or actions, often the fundamental principle itself stays constant.
a case in point is the recognized economic principle mandating the deduction of depreciation of capital from accounting income to preserve productive capacity.
this fundamental remains valid and simply necessitates expansion to include natural capital alongside human-made capital.
the exhaustion of natural resources incurs a cost and warrants inclusion in the system of national accounts at the macro level, project assessments at the micro level, and international balance of payments evaluations.
i will conclude this opening essay by discussing the insufficient sense of urgency and ethical drive instigated by sustainable development in institutions like the world bank, academia, the u.s. government, and many other national governments.
while there are occasional individuals within these sectors who stand out as exceptions, acting as prophetic voices in the midst of indifference, it remains puzzling why these calls for action elicit minimal reaction from the broader community.
what measures must be taken to move beyond our usual state of denial?
in may 1992, a notable event unfolded known as the "joint appeal by science and religion on the environment," spearheaded by distinguished scientists carl sagan, edward o.
wilson, and stephen jay gould, in collaboration with several religious leaders and hosted by then-senator al gore.
despite the scientists' well-known advocacy of scientific materialism and dismissal of religious interpretations of the universe, their deep concern for the environment was evident.
they believed that while science provided the knowledge, it lacked the ethical guidance to motivate action, prompting them to seek support from the religious community.
this initiative aimed to combine the moral compass of religion with the scientific means to drive positive change, using the metaphor that religion would guide moral direction while science would provide the means to achieve it.
the skeptics' attempt to harness the moral fervor of the religious community in the name of ecology is perplexing, given that the very foundation of believers' moral commitment stems from the deep-seated belief that their religious symbols and teachings reveal fundamental truths about reality.
without this conviction, the ethical influence of religions would be rendered ineffective.
it is challenging to envision any significant change in human behaviors without a collective human faith in the intrinsic value of our moral pursuits.
a profound trust in the essence of reality is crucial for the longevity of ecological ethics.
this trust should stem from a belief in the meaningfulness of the universe, viewing it as an evolving "promise." a shared understanding that the cosmos represents a purposeful process akin to human notions of intent is essential for sustaining enduring global and cross-generational dedication to the well-being of the planet.
haught stresses that sagan, wilson, and gould advocate for a cosmology of scientific materialism, portraying the cosmos as a random occurrence and life as merely incidental, ultimately reducible to lifeless matter in motion.
they believe that objective value and purpose do not exist beyond basic survival and reproduction instincts, which they see as purely mechanical.
asking for a moral compass in this context is compared to requesting a magnetic compass in a world where magnetic north does not exist.
just as a compass needle is useless without an external force to guide it, a morally attuned individual in a world devoid of objective value is like a compass needle lacking any external magnetic pull.
gould commented on the necessity of establishing an emotional connection with nature to effectively preserve species and landscapes.
he questioned whether it is conceivable to develop affection for an accident or for accidents to reciprocate such sentiments.
although he harbored doubts about accidents loving each other or having the impulse to protect one another, he acknowledged that scientific materialists could develop a profound admiration for the world they meticulously scrutinize.
scientists often develop a deep fondness for the world, perhaps more so than theologians, and he pondered whether they should acknowledge this affection.
gould proposed reflecting on how scientists could develop an attachment to something that their scientific beliefs classify as accidental.
he raised the question of whether they genuinely appreciate random occurrences in their daily lives or whether they perceive them as bothersome.
at the joint appeal meeting in washington, d.c., the discussions frequently brushed over the lack of a clear purpose by emphasizing the phrase "for our children." however, this approach failed to address the fundamental issue that if we are merely accidents, then so are our children, making it insufficient to defer the dilemma to the next generation.
i vividly remember a woman, possibly a reporter or photographer rather than an official participant, who grew visibly frustrated with the sentimental emphasis on "our children." she grabbed the microphone and questioned whether her lack of children meant she had no reason to care about the future of god's creation.
this intervention resonated with me, highlighting the inadequacy of defining one's worth solely on their ability to pass on their genes, as suggested by some biologists.
i strongly believed that including part 7, focusing on religion and ethics, in this book was crucial, alongside the more conventional sections covering economic theory, operational policy, national accounts, population, international trade, and the recent history of economic thought on sustainability.
while i rank this topic as the most important, i placed it last due to feeling less qualified to address it and anticipating controversy in a society where political correctness often implies an anti-religious stance.
as a tactic for consensus-building, saving the most controversial issues for the end, even if they are the most crucial, seemed prudent.
however, it would have been misleading not to address them at all.
sustainability has faced challenges in gaining acceptance within economic theory primarily because the focus of economics in the last fifty years has been predominantly on promoting economic growth.
the concept of "economic growth" has mainly revolved around increasing the gross national product (gnp).
the conventional belief has been that all challenges can be addressed, if not entirely resolved, through perpetually augmenting the gnp.
unlike in microeconomics, where each business has an ideal scale beyond which expansion may not be beneficial, the macroeconomy lacks a clear concept of an optimal scale.
consequently, the idea that further economic growth could become counterproductive is largely disregarded at the macroeconomic level.
there are multiple reasons for this perspective.
initially, all microeconomic activities are viewed as components of a larger entity, with their scale restricted by their relationship to this broader structure to achieve an appropriate or optimal size.
in contrast, the macroeconomy is not considered a part of a larger entity but is perceived as the whole system.
it has the capacity for perpetual growth, alleviating temporary constraints within specific sectors caused by shortages in complementary sectors.
with the correct proportions maintained, both the overall system and its individual components can expand continuously.
while individual firms may face limitations in reaching an optimal scale due to managerial constraints, industries or sectors can sustain perpetual growth by incorporating new firms.
pricing serves to assess relative scarcity and assist in maintaining the necessary balance among various elements, without acknowledging any absolute scarcity that could restrict the macroeconomy's scale.
the foundation of the chapters in part i lies in the concept that the macroeconomy is a subsystem of a larger finite and non-growing ecosystem, rather than a stand-alone entity.
thus, it suggests that the macroeconomy also must maintain an optimal scale.
key to achieving this scale is ensuring that the economy's flow of throughput - from raw material inputs to converted commodities and eventual waste outputs - remains within the regenerative and absorptive limits of the ecosystem.
essentially, sustainable development dictates that the economic subsystem should not exceed a scale that the ecosystem can continually support in the long run.
the value of services is on the rise, yet the matter and energy needed for these services are decreasing.
in this book, this qualitative enhancement in the arts is labeled as "development," whereas simply raising the quantity of computers, regardless of their age, is termed "growth." gnp accounting fails to differentiate between growth and development, as both contribute to an upsurge in the gnp, a boost in the worth of yearly goods and services, and are categorized as "economic growth." however, merging qualitative advancement with a quantitative increase in the same value metric causes significant confusion.
i propose that sustainable development requires a significant departure from a growth-focused economy towards a steady-state economy, particularly in the developed world first, and eventually globally.
my initial priority is to present a comprehensive argument for this fundamental shift in perspective.
i aim to outline the key theoretical and ethical contradictions of a growth economy and demonstrate how they can be addressed by transitioning to a steady state.
additionally, i plan to examine the practical shortcomings of a growth economy when seen as initial steps towards achieving a steady state.
despite being a widely recognized fact even among economists that the economy relies on natural resources from the environment and produces waste, this crucial aspect is often overlooked in the circular flow model.
economists primarily focus on scarcity, therefore, the initial assumption that environmental resources were abundant compared to economic needs was valid in the early stages of economic theory.
nevertheless, as the economy expanded, it became evident that resources are now scarce, though this absolute scarcity may not reflect in relative prices.
it is no longer reasonable to exclude the concept of throughput, as seen in the ad hoc inclusion of "externalities" to address the effects of increased throughput in the economy.
this approach is akin to using "epicycles" in astronomical theories to explain deviations from the ideal circular motion of celestial bodies.
undoubtedly, one of the most significant setbacks in growth is the ongoing arms race, which has ironically resulted in reduced security rather than enhanced it.
this has escalated the risks from the loss of individual lives to the endangerment of life as a whole through widespread ecocide.
instances such as excessive population growth, toxic waste accumulation, acid rain, climate manipulation, destruction of rainforests, and the disruption of ecosystem services serve as prime examples of growth failures.
recognizing these as initial strides towards transitioning to a sustainable economy necessitates a deliberate and optimistic mindset.
money fetishism exemplifies alfred north whitehead's concept of "the fallacy of misplaced concreteness," where one reasons at an abstract level but erroneously applies the outcomes of that logic to a concrete level.
this notion suggests that the circular flow of abstract exchange value implies a similar circular flow of physical commodities within actual gnp.
for instance, the belief that money in savings can perpetually grow through compound interest leads to the misconception that real wealth and welfare can also expand perpetually.
this fallacy assumes that characteristics attributed to the symbolic representation of wealth are directly applicable to tangible wealth.
the term "permanently" does not equate to "in the meantime," a period during which we have sidestepped the illogical act of amassing use values in favor of accumulating exchange value and using it as collateral for future use values at the micro level.
however, unless future use value or actual wealth has increased at the same pace as the growth in accumulations of exchange value, a devaluation of exchange value may occur due to factors such as inflation or debt repudiation after a certain period.
at the macro level, constraints will inevitably resurface, despite being disregarded at the micro level, where the pursuit of gathering exchange value has become the primary driving force.
the process of measurement always entails some form of interaction and influence on the reality being assessed.
this concept, akin to the heisenberg principle, holds particular significance in the field of economics.
in economic contexts, metrics used to gauge success, determine rewards, or calculate taxes often lead to unintended consequences for the subject under evaluation.
this phenomenon is exemplified by a story illustrating the pitfalls of employing quantified objectives in managing a tuberculosis hospital.
for instance, in an attempt to measure patients' progress, the number of daily coughs was selected as an indicator of improvement.
patients' coughs were meticulously recorded by attaching microphones to their beds.
subsequently, the hospital staff noticed a correlation between their performance evaluations and the frequency of patient coughs.
as a result, patients were prescribed codeine more frequently to reduce coughing, as coughing lessens when patients are more relaxed.
regrettably, the patients' conditions deteriorated because they were not expelling congestion through coughing.
consequently, the cough index was ultimately discarded in this scenario.
examples of this phenomenon are not limited to the soviet union but are rather widespread.
in academia, professors are often incentivized based on the quantity of their publications, leading to a trend of shorter articles approaching the minimum publishable research unit.
simultaneously, the prevalence of co-authors has risen, resulting in more collaborative efforts on condensed papers.
this shift prioritizes the quantity of publications bearing one's name rather than the discovery and sharing of comprehensive knowledge.
these examples aim to illustrate that, similar to quantified success indexes, gnp is not merely an objective measure but also has a significant distorting impact on the reality it seeks to represent.
gnp, functioning as a measure of throughput rather than welfare, is closely tied to welfare in a scenario with unlimited resources.
however, in a finite world with a fully utilized carrying capacity, high throughput translates to a burden.
therefore, basing national policies on maximizing gnp is shortsighted; it essentially amounts to prioritizing depletion and pollution.
wisdom entails having knowledge of techniques, understanding the significance of purposes, and recognizing the boundaries within which technique and purpose operate.
it takes wise judgment to differentiate between genuine limits and temporary obstacles and to discern fundamental purposes from mere desires.
it is through such discernment that unchecked growth can be curbed.
given the shift towards an information-based economy, there is a possibility of transitioning to a wisdom economy, characterized by a dynamic steady state.
economists agree that the goals of efficient allocation and just distribution should be treated independently.
it is widely acknowledged that prices are best left to serve efficiency, while equity is better achieved through income redistribution policies.
a third crucial policy goal is the proper scale, which necessitates a separate policy instrument.
although economists have not fully embraced this concept yet, its rationale runs parallel to the separation of allocation and distribution.
the market's role in pricing factors of production and distributing profits does impact income distribution.
balancing efficiency with incentives sometimes requires adjusting income distribution.
the market's primary focus is to incentivize efficient allocation rather than achieving justice.
moreover, historical factors like property ownership greatly influence income distribution and are not solely tied to efficiency or justice.
conflicts can arise between these values, and the market does not automatically resolve them.
the initial step involves establishing a set amount of pollution allowances.
these allowances are carefully calculated to fall within the ecological limits of the specific airshed or watershed.
this approach ensures that the overall environmental impact remains at a sustainable level by imposing an economic threshold from the outset.
contrary to overlooking the scale of pollution, this strategy prioritizes resolving the question of sustainable scale right from the start.
determining this threshold could be based on estimations of carrying capacity, safe minimum standards, or a cost-benefit analysis, but the key is to establish a cap on total pollution emissions.
once social decisions concerning an ecologically sustainable scale and an ethically just distribution have been made, reallocation among individuals through markets can only be allowed in the pursuit of efficiency, and only after the above priorities are met.
the key to achieving this balance is by fixing the total quantity of permits while allowing market prices to fluctuate.
in scenarios where the total quantity is determined through willingness-to-pay studies providing a shadow price and an aggregate quantity, neoclassical economists aiming to prevent a disconnect between allocation and scale must ensure trading occurs at the calculated shadow price.
however, in practical terms, market prices are left to fluctuate, indicating a clear separation between allocation and scale, showcasing the pragmatic approach to the issue.
economists have predominantly assessed the effectiveness of the tradable pollution permits scheme compared to command and control allocative schemes, highlighting its efficiency in allocation.
however, the crucial aspects of scale and distribution have not received adequate attention.
while tradable permits are often regarded as an individualistic and free-market solution, it is essential to recognize that this freedom is established within predetermined scale and distributive boundaries agreed upon collectively.
economists typically address the scale issue by attempting to incorporate it into allocation, suggesting that achieving accurate pricing will eliminate any problems related to scale.
in the past, when the economy was small, the correct price for abundant environmental services was zero.
economists argue that as these resources become scarce, establishing the appropriate positive price will lead to efficient allocation.
while pricing scarce resources is essential for solving allocation challenges, the error lies in assuming that this resolves the scale issue.
the scenario of a small-scale economy with many zero-priced environmental services is fundamentally different from a large-scale economy where these services are priced positively.
even though both cases represent efficient allocation due to "correct pricing," it remains important to consider whether individuals are better off in the former or latter scenario.
i agree with the assessment that discounting should not be seen as a solution to solely address the scale issue instead of the distribution problem.
while justice concerning the future is a key factor motivating sustainability goals, an excessively large scale can threaten sustainability.
however, considering the optimal scale involves more than just future considerations.
it is possible for a system to be too large in the present, even if it can be sustained for the future.
for instance, expanding to the extent of displacing other species and imposing strict management measures to maintain balance could lead to an overly large scale, even if it is technically sustainable.
therefore, scale considerations should not be overshadowed by distribution concerns, although it is acknowledged that intergenerational aspects of distribution do intersect with scale issues to a significant extent.
in the past, when the human economy was insignificant compared to the natural world, sources and sinks were viewed as infinite and not scarce.
this perception allowed them to be disregarded in economic considerations.
the prevailing belief was that since there were no scarcities imposed by the larger system, there was no need to account for it.
while this viewpoint was once valid, it is no longer sustainable.
as kenneth boulding accentuates, as something grows, it also expands!
unlike the economy, the ecosystem has not grown proportionally.
the question now arises: how does the size of the economy compare to that of the ecosystem?
if each person continues to consume resources at a steady rate, the time it takes for overall human impact to double would align with the population doubling time, estimated to be around forty years.
however, economic advancement typically involves raising individual resource consumption levels to hasten human impact growth beyond the natural population trend.
the existence of environmental problems such as the greenhouse effect, ozone layer depletion, and acid rain signifies that we have surpassed a safe threshold for the scale of economic activity.
the author concludes by posing the question of whether we are acting recklessly like a cowboy, adventurously like a spaceman, or clumsily like a bull in a china shop.
considering the economic process as an open subsystem of a closed finite total system raises the query of the appropriate size of the subsystem in relation to the total system, a question that has been somewhat overlooked.
this oversight has been possible in two ways: firstly, by defining the economic subsystem as infinitesimally small compared to the total system, rendering its scale negligible; and secondly, by regarding the economy as encompassing the entire system.
by encompassing all aspects, the issue of scale concerning the total system becomes moot.
these contrasting viewpoints are akin to boulding's vivid comparison of the "cowboy economy" and the "spaceman economy." the cowboy, residing in vast lands, operates on a linear flow from source to destination, without recycling necessary.
in contrast, the spaceman, confined to a small capsule, functions within strict material cycles and immediate feedback loops, meticulously controlling and adapting to address his needs.
for the cowboy, scale holds little significance, while for the spaceman, scale is paramount.
the concept of the optimal scale of a single activity is familiar to economists and is a central theme in microeconomics.
in this field, the focus is on analyzing specific activities such as producing shoes or consuming ice cream by defining cost and benefit functions.
it is widely accepted that as the scale of an activity increases, marginal costs tend to rise while marginal benefits tend to decrease.
the fundamental principle of microeconomics is to expand the scale of an activity until the point where marginal costs are equal to marginal benefits, defining the optimal scale.
essentially, the entirety of microeconomics revolves around exploring this principle in various contexts.
the number of people or their individual consumption levels become insignificant as long as the correct proportions and relative prices are maintained.
while each micro activity is believed to have an optimal scale, it raises the question of why the aggregate of all micro activities wouldn't have an optimal scale.
the argument that constraints on individual activities lie in the interdependence among them, and that these restrictions balance out with overall economic growth, prompts the challenge of increasing the scale of the carbon and hydrologic cycles in line with industrial and agricultural expansion.
the idea that if the ecosystem can expand endlessly, so can the overall economy is acknowledged, but a suggestion is made not to take it too seriously until the earth's surface can grow at a rate matching the interest rate.
central to the current economic theory and practice crisis is the unsustainable consumption of the earth's resources, leading to a depletion of its capacity for renewal.
this results in the consumption of natural capital under the guise of income.
as we navigate these challenges, it becomes imperative to focus on consumption, value addition, and welfare within economic theory.
by examining traditional economic principles, we can uncover valuable insights and identify crucial mistakes that need rectification.
in the previously mentioned quote from marshall, he discusses the concept of "new utilities" introduced by humans, suggesting that there could be inherent utility in matter.
however, later economists have focused on new utilities and added value, overlooking the intrinsic value that nature inherently possesses.
according to the conventional economic perspective found in textbooks, we are seen as consuming only the value that we have contributed to natural resources.
this value is repeatedly added to the unchanging fundamental components and consumed repeatedly in a cycle, known as the famous circular flow.
if you uphold the belief that value is primarily derived from labor and capital, with nature being viewed simply as a nondestructible and abundant material source that inherently lacks value, then this perspective can be deemed reasonable.
if you find yourself in a state of poverty, the solution is to increase value through your own efforts and investments.
you possess the ability to utilize your labor and build up your capital, whether through personal accumulation or by seeking external financial support.
the constraints imposed by nature are non-existent in this viewpoint.
rather than complaining, it is encouraged to take action, be productive, and cease dwelling on illusory limitations.
this outlook is commonly shared among neoclassical economists and is closely tied to john locke's idea that the justification of private property hinges on the notion that one must have mixed their labor with the raw materials to enhance its value and claim ownership.
a method of constructing an argument involves considering the contrary and demonstrating its implausibility.
if human-created resources could almost entirely replace natural resources, then natural resources should also be able to almost wholly replace man-made resources.
in that case, the accumulation of man-made assets would have been unnecessary from the outset, as nature had already provided a satisfactory substitute.
however, throughout history, the accumulation of man-made resources occurred specifically because they complement natural resources.
although natural and man-made capital are complementary, economists have often viewed them as substitutes.
one reason for this is that not all economists adhere to leontief's input-output model, which assumes fixed factor proportions and treats all factors as complements.
another factor is the mathematical definitions of complementarity and substitutability, which in a two-factor scenario typically imply substitution.
additionally, the focus on two-dimensional paper in textbooks highlights this case and perpetuates the misconception.
the prevalence of cobb-douglas and similar production functions, emphasizing substitutability between factors, further contributes to this notion.
however, some economists are now recognizing the importance of limiting substitution through principles like the law of conservation of mass.
it is essential to consider overall complementarity relationships rather than solely focusing on marginal substitution.
for instance, while private spending on car maintenance may seem to substitute for reduced public investment in roads at the margin, it should not overshadow the fundamental complementary nature of private cars and roads as forms of capital.
this phenomenon is a result of altering product aggregation rather than trading one factor for another within a specific product isoquant.
moreover, a fresh product could be developed to deliver equivalent service using fewer resources, such as light bulbs that provide increased lumens per watt.
this represents technical advancement - a qualitative enhancement in the current technology - rather than substituting a set amount of capital for resources in manufacturing a particular product quantity.
if we acknowledge that natural and man-made capital are complementary resources rather than interchangeable ones, it leads to certain implications.
when resources complement each other, the one that is scarce becomes the limiting factor.
on the other hand, if resources can substitute for each other, neither becomes a limiting factor as the availability of one doesn't significantly impact the productivity of the other.
the concept of a limiting factor corresponds to leibig's law of the minimum in ecology.
if natural or man-made capital can act as a restricting element, it cannot be considered when resources are seen as substitutable.
identifying which of the two resources is the limiting factor, meaning the one in shortest supply, becomes essential once we recognize them as complements.
if we unconsciously acknowledge that the expansion of production is unsustainable, then addressing both equitable distribution and population control becomes essential to alleviating poverty.
however, these measures are often dismissed as unfeasible by pragmatic policymakers, leading to the unwarranted rejection of any argument supporting them.
these biases could have prevented us from recognizing the fundamental reality that man-made and natural capital are interdependent, with natural resources now acting as the primary limiting factor.
the increase in man-made capital does not replace natural resources but instead intensifies the pressure on them, depleting them more rapidly to sustain the value of man-made assets temporarily, thereby exacerbating their scarcity in the future.
one of the primary challenges faced by the government is the maintenance of industrial harmony between labor and capital.
historically, this has been achieved by redistributing resources from landlords to both labor and capital.
while landlords are generally unpopular, when the government adopts the role of the landlord and aims for industrial peace through resource availability at low prices, it is no longer the landlord class that bears the cost.
in fact, this approach signifies a neglect of the government's responsibility as a guardian of the public and future generations.
taking on this role more responsibly would entail raising resource prices, thereby potentially heightening conflicts between labor and capital.
environmentalism often overlooks these significant issues in political economy.
looking ahead, environmentalists in the twenty-first century will need to address these critical challenges.
despite being persuaded by the preceding argument advocating for a transition in investment focus from artificial to natural capital, a challenge persists.
given that natural capital is inherently not created by humans, the meaning of "investing" in it may not be readily apparent.
nevertheless, the term "investment" is appropriate, as it entails the traditional idea of delaying gratification or abstaining from immediate consumption as a method of investing in natural capital.
prior to delving deeper into defining investment in natural capital, it is essential to first explore the concept of natural capital itself.
furthermore, there exists a significant category that straddles the definitions of natural and man-made capital.
assets like plantation forests, fish ponds, and selectively bred cattle, though not wholly man-made, undergo substantial alterations from their original state due to human intervention.
these assets are termed "cultivated natural capital," encompassing sectors like agriculture, aquaculture, and plantation forestry.
this designation challenges the distinction between natural and man-made capital and questions their status as complements.
cultivated natural capital comprises both natural and man-made elements.
for instance, a plantation forest comprises natural assets like sunlight, rain, and soil nutrients alongside man-made aspects like planting techniques, spacing decisions, culling strategies, and disease control.
generally, cultivated natural capital showcases a significant complementary relationship between its natural and man-made components.
investment in renewable natural capital is typically seen as a passive endeavor.
however, there is potential for more actively investing in cultivated natural capital.
to what extent can we pursue this form of investment?
is it conceivable to cultivate an entire biosphere?
with regard to biosphere ii in arizona, does it have the potential to succeed?
while it is undoubtedly valuable for experimental purposes on a small scale, would scaling up such active investment in cultivated natural capital to ecosystem and biospheric levels be a promising future prospect?
could the vast ocean be transformed entirely into a catfish pond?
even if such a feat were achievable, would there not still be a need for synergy with the fundamental natural capital of sunlight, chlorophyll, and decomposers?
the extent to which we can depend on developed natural resources remains uncertain.
presently, our knowledge of ecosystems is insufficient to consider the large-scale restructuring as anything more than minimally impactful at best and potentially hazardous at worst.
paul ehrlich emphasizes that ecological economics is time-bound, underscoring the urgency of the situation.
there is no room for creating a controlled "biosphere ii" due to time constraints.
instead, the focus should be on preserving the existing biosphere i, promoting its natural regeneration through patient waiting.
in this context, "laissez faire" takes on a heightened significance for ecological economists, advocating for a hands-off approach to allow for natural recovery.
in an empty world where growth is readily available, investments in distributive efficiency may not be a priority.
however, in a full world where growth is constrained, enhancing efficiency becomes crucial.
therefore, the potential for efficiency gains through redistribution cannot be overlooked.
economists have extensively examined service efficiency, particularly through the price mechanism, in the context of allocative efficiency.
delving deeper into ratio 0 may not yield significantly greater returns compared to studying the other three ratios, unless it pertains to the prospect of redistribution.
ratio 2, known as maintenance efficiency or durability, demonstrates the lifespan of man-made capital stock.
in contrast, ratio 1 signifies the service output within a specific timeframe.
ratio 2 represents the duration over which the stock provides a service, indicating its resilience.
this longevity of the stock, also referred to as the "residence time," can be enhanced by minimizing resource depletion and pollution.
improving maintenance efficiency involves creating long-lasting, repairable, and recyclable products, or by reducing the dependence on certain commodities through lifestyle choices.
the growth efficiency of natural capital to produce an increment for off-take as throughput is defined by ratio 3.
it relies on the inherent biological growth rate of the exploited population within its ecosystem.
for instance, pine trees have a faster growth rate compared to mahogany.
therefore, in scenarios where either type can be utilized, pine is considered more efficient.
nature offers a variety of species with diverse growth rates.
opting for faster-growing species in technology and consumption design would enhance efficiency, all other things being equal.
the current disorganized arrangement of ecosystem costs can be attributed to a lack of acknowledgment of the issue and a limited understanding of ecosystem operations.
given the significant uncertainties regarding ecosystem expenses, it is advisable to adopt a cautious approach and refrain from further expansion.
even with precise knowledge and a cost-effective sequence of environmental expenses, there exists an optimum threshold beyond which additional growth becomes uneconomical.
this concept of the optimum scale is primarily human-centered, valuing all other species merely for their usefulness to human well-being.
should we assign intrinsic worth to other sentient beings to some extent, the ideal scale of human influence would be reduced compared to a scenario where only human sentience matters.
enhancing natural capital investment would then bring an added advantage of amplifying life-support services for non-human species, acknowledging their right to experience life rather than deeming it insignificant, albeit not deemed equal to human well-being.
transforming the categorization of transactions to shift a nation's trade balance from surplus to deficit could prompt a distinct series of suggestions and measures from the international monetary fund.
this adjustment in balance-of-payments record-keeping ought to be the primary area of attention for the imf's recent engagement in fostering environmentally sustainable advancement.
the world bank should actively support and motivate the executives and employees of its affiliated organization to prioritize this task, as it may not be their usual area of focus.
transitioning the taxation framework towards throughput promotes higher efficiency in throughput and internalizes externalities related to depletion and pollution.
while it is acknowledged that precise calculations of external costs may not be possible, as typically aimed for with a pigouvian tax, which seeks to align marginal social costs and benefits for individual activities, such exact estimations and attributions prove intricate and uncertain.
insisting on them from the start would only serve as a labor-intensive undertaking for econometricians, leading to prolonged unemployment and environmental deterioration for the general population.
the primary source of generating public revenue would be taxation on throughput, focusing on either depletion or pollution.
income tax would primarily serve for wealth redistribution rather than as a significant revenue source.
throughput taxes would serve the dual purpose of revenue generation and incentivizing reduction in throughput.
some individuals express concerns regarding the sustainability of the tax base with reduced throughput.
however, as throughput cannot be wholly eliminated, even minimal levels will still generate tax revenue, allowing for adjustments in tax rates to fulfill financial requirements.
it is the added value that can potentially be taxed out of existence, not the throughput itself.
moreover, taxing a product with inelastic demand demonstrates allocative efficiency.
certainly, the initial step towards attaining sustainable development should commence in the northern regions before extending to the south.
it is unreasonable to demand sustainability sacrifices from the south without implementing comparable measures in the north first.
the primary limitation hindering the world bank's facilitation of ecologically sustainable development is its influence solely over the south, not the north.
therefore, mechanisms need to be devised to motivate the northern regions also.
the world bank should act as an impartial mediator articulating the south's valid concerns towards the north, instead of the reverse.
initiatives in this direction have already been kickstarted by nordic countries and the netherlands.
historically, natural capital was undervalued and often considered inexhaustible, resulting in it being regarded as having zero value.
consequently, whether it was viewed as a supplement or replacement for human-made capital seemed inconsequential.
presently, the diminishing natural capital is perceived as both scarce and complimentary, thereby imposing restrictions.
for instance, the availability of cut timber is restrained not by the number of sawmills but by the quantity of remaining standing forests.
similarly, the supply of pumped crude oil is dictated by the remaining petroleum reserves in the ground rather than the pumping capacity.
moreover, the ability of the atmosphere to absorb co2 is anticipated to become a more critical limitation on the rate of petroleum combustion than the diminishing oil reserves.
how can we invest in something that inherently cannot be created by humans?
if it were possible to create, it would be classified as manmade capital.
when dealing with renewable resources, we have the option of making investments that involve allowing natural growth to increase the stock for future use, following the concept of "waiting" in the marshallian sense rather than depleting it.
conversely, for nonrenewable resources, this waiting strategy is not applicable, and the only choice is to sell them off.
therefore, the crucial question arises: at what rate do we deplete these resources, and how much of the profits can be considered as income if we reinvest the remainder in the most suitable renewable alternative available?
subsequently, decisions have to be made on how much of the income deemed appropriate is spent on consumption and how much should be reinvested.
an alternative renewable form of capital to natural resources is the amalgamation of natural and artificial resources found in plantations, fish farms, and similar setups, referred to as "cultivated natural capital." even in this significant blend, there is a vital interplay between natural and artificial components.
for instance, a plantation forest may utilize man-made resources for tree planting, pest control, and selecting the appropriate rotation, while still relying on natural resources such as rainfall, sunlight, and soil, which eventually impose limitations.
additionally, cultivating natural capital often results in reduced biodiversity compared to pure natural capital, which should be regarded as a drawback.
as outlined in the opening of part 1, understanding the precise components of "economic growth" is fundamental before debating whether its pace should be moderated or accelerated.
this directs focus towards the methodologies and fundamental concepts that form the basis of our national accounting system, frequently referred to as gnp accounts.
within this section, chapter 6 presents a cautious argument, crafted for the world bank, advocating for a modification of our national accounts.
in contrast, chapter 7 puts forward more progressive proposals, informed by the principles of irving fisher.
we did not deem the index of sustainable economic welfare (isew) as a suitable objective for economic policy due to its inherent flaws.
comparing gross national product (gnp) to a cigarette, the isew could be seen as a cigarette with a charcoal filter.
just as smoking a filtered cigarette is preferred for those addicted to smoking, utilizing the isew is more suitable for those addicted to numerical measures of well-being.
it is evident that we have become overly reliant on these measures, akin to an addiction that requires fulfillment.
however, it is crucial not to settle for this dependency but rather contemplate ways to overcome it.
the revelation that our obsession with economic growth is tied to arbitrary indicators of welfare prompts the thought that perhaps we would be better off without such measures altogether.
the presence of any numerical welfare index invites the temptation of misplaced importance, leading us to focus on the distorted reflection of reality represented by the index rather than addressing the reality itself.
the significant increase in human populations, various artifacts, and the exploitation of plants and animals for human purposes over the last fifty years could perhaps be more accurately described as an implosion rather than an explosion.
this term implies a gathering together within a limited environment, rather than a spreading outwards.
it signifies a state of congestion, mutual interference, and conflicting collisions, as defensive spending illustrates the growing trend of activities canceling each other out due to mutual interference.
data regarding geological and ecological depletion is typically presented in physical units and needs to undergo a valuation process before it can be deducted from nnp.
this assessment may involve adopting certain arbitrary standards.
the valuation process could rely on either replacement cost or willingness to pay, selecting the lesser of the two to maintain a cautious approach.
the level of arbitrariness introduced might not exceed that found in present estimations of depreciation of human-made assets, particularly when considering factors like obsolescence or moral devaluation alongside physical parameters.
viewed from a historical perspective, the mercantilist viewpoint appears riddled with contradictions and impossibilities, prompting us to chuckle and shake our heads.
while it's relatively easy to spot these flaws in hindsight, it's often trickier to recognize potential anomalies in our contemporary development theories.
i propose that it's conceivable we might be championing ideas that are unattainable, akin to advocating for all nations to maintain a trade surplus, a pursuit that usually results in conflict and dismay, as illustrated by the mercantilist era.
although focusing on maximizing gross national product (gnp) seems more rational than prioritizing gold reserves, significant anomalies persist.
i'm not discussing the widely acknowledged issue of wealth distribution, which economists have extensively addressed.
instead, i'm highlighting the notion that gnp, regardless of its distribution, could serve as more of a gauge of expenses rather than benefits, a concept i'll elaborate on later.
opposing the aforementioned argument, proponents of technological advancement argue that technology has the potential to enhance resource productivity infinitely, making it possible for all nations to achieve greater prosperity.
however, this rebuttal overlooks the fact that the initial argument was focused on per capita resource consumption rather than per capita output or well-being.
even if technology were able to continuously boost resource productivity, resulting in a growing value stream from the same physical resources, the challenge of maintaining resource flows within ecological boundaries would persist.
it would still be unrealistic to apply the current u.
while it is conceivable that a novel and highly efficient resource utilization system could be established, it would more likely acknowledge the notion of technological limitations rather than disprove it.
these considerations also introduce the notion of "overdevelopment" in relation to "underdevelopment": an overdeveloped nation could be characterized as one where individual resource consumption is at a level that, if extended globally, would be unsustainable in the long term.
similarly, an underdeveloped nation would have a per capita resource consumption below what could be sustained globally over time.
it may be more precise to replace "indefinitely" with a specific timeframe, such as one hundred or five hundred years.
however, a limitation of these definitions is that they focus on per capita measures and do not consider the total population size and its distribution across countries.
rebuilding would not be supported by east texas oil this time, necessitating offshore alaskan oil without relying on mesabi range iron ore.
developing nations trading their valuable geological resources for luxury items for the wealthy may face similar challenges.
are there indicators in our economic records to signal this risk?
kuwait illustrates this dilemma; boasting a high gnp per capita, is it due to income or depletion of resources?
despite common sense pointing to the latter, gnp calculations categorize it as immediate earnings.
the traditional national accounting approach pioneered by pigou and others has become increasingly inappropriate for contemporary times.
the shift can be attributed to the significant changes that have occurred in the world since the 1920s, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
this evolution, which aligns more closely with fisher's perspective than pigou's, is marked by the transition from a world characterized by ample resources to one where resources are fully utilized.
in the earlier era of abundance, economic throughput was perceived as a continuous process without constraints, and hence not considered a scarce or costly commodity.
as the world progressed towards a state of full capacity utilization, the emphasis on throughput as a measure of capital stock and the services it signifies became inadequate.
in this context, throughput emerged as a more tangible and practical measure compared to the abstract notion of services rendered by capital stock.
naturally, gnp serves as a metric for the ongoing production or consumption.
hence, it predominantly reflects the expenses associated with preserving the capital stock, quantifying the essential yet undesirable tasks related to depletion, pollution, and labor required to uphold the capital stock against the inevitable physical wear and tear that occurs as it is utilized to fulfill needs.
it is crucial to note that "capital" is broadly defined as per fisher, encompassing items such as umbrellas, shoes, pencils, and similar goods.
the satisfaction of needs is facilitated by the existing capital stock, rather than by the inherent but lamentable tendency of the stock to deteriorate or be depleted.
gnp encompasses components of the three fundamental measures.
it involves the valuation of services provided by all rented assets within the accounting period, excluding those used by owners, except for owner-occupied residences where a rental value is estimated and included.
natural ecosystem services are not factored into gnp calculations.
the flow of value from production necessary for the upkeep and replacement of human capital, assets, and resources, such as consumer goods, is represented in the throughput value.
the net change in accumulated assets and resources signifies net investment but does not incorporate alterations in natural assets like depletion of geological resources or disruptions in environmental functions.
the reduction of minerals and degradation of ecological life-support resources gathered over centuries are not deducted when computing changes in assets and resources, nor is the decline in the current services of environmental functions subtracted from the value of services provided by manufactured goods.
to what extent does gross national product (gnp) stay true to its essence when broken down into these more fundamental measures?
if we view services as a benefit, throughput as a cost, and net accumulation as a change in assets and resources, is it logical to aggregate these disparate metrics together?
isn't it akin to how a merchant's accountant might total up sales, expenses, and inventory changes?
what analytical value could arise from merging such diverse figures?
is it rational to define economic progress based on the growth of this questionable total, even after adjusting for inflation, population growth, and unequal distribution of wealth?
certain economists may raise objections to the preceding argument by asserting that every addition to the gross national product (gnp) is the result of a transaction.
for a transaction to take place, each party involved must have determined that the gains from engaging in the deal outweigh the associated costs.
consequently, any rise in gnp is inherently founded on a detailed evaluation of costs and benefits at the individual level.
thus, a supplementary macro-level assessment could be viewed as unnecessary at most and potentially harmful to personal liberty at worst.
secondly, utilizing the fallacy of composition occurs when arguing from the specific to the general.
the concept of micro rationality often results in macro irrationality, as observed through instances such as the paradox of thrift, the tragedy of the commons, the prisoner's dilemma, the tyranny of small decisions, and the arms race.
it is imperative to conduct macro-level assessments of costs and benefits.
this viewpoint is supported by conventional economists who advocate for enhancing overall economic growth beyond individualistic market determinations.
public policies aimed at boosting aggregate growth must be grounded on an implicit evaluation of costs and benefits at the macro level and the belief that the societal advantages of growth outweigh the societal costs.
the core debate centers around the validity of this belief rather than the validity of macro cost-benefit analyses.
implementing the three-accounts approach would offer more pertinent insights and enhance the accuracy of our understanding of social costs and benefits.
the challenge with adopting an optimizing approach is not only the necessity for precise evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with further stock accumulation but also the requirement for the marginal cost and benefit functions to exhibit "well-behaved" characteristics.
essentially, this denotes that the marginal benefit curve should show a consistent decrease, while the marginal cost curve should show a consistent increase.
the former expectation seems reasonable as rational individuals typically address their most urgent needs first, implying that each additional stock or fund is typically allocated to less critical requirements.
however, the marginal cost curve signifies the exhaustion of geological resources and the decline in current environmental services.
it is uncertain whether the loss of environmental functions will occur in a structured manner from less to more crucial amidst the growing demand.
therefore, a prudent approach may involve establishing the accumulation level at an ecologically sustainable threshold.
this could involve ensuring that the population multiplied by per capita resource consumption remains within or even below the carrying capacity to avoid resource depletion.
in my view, irving fisher's perspective appears highly practical, consistent, and rational.
fisher's approach offers the benefit of distinctively delineating costs and benefits, allowing for a more comprehensive measurement of each.
beyond merely acknowledging rented asset services, fisher also considers the value of owner-operated assets which are often overlooked.
he factors in costs such as the depletion of natural resources, the depreciation of environmental quality, and the labor disutility, currently ignored by gnp calculation or erroneously treated as advantages.
could this alternative methodology not offer a more reasoned strategy compared to the pursuit of gnp maximization, which essentially amplifies throughput and subsequently elevates the expenses linked to resource depletion and environmental pollution?
even though marxists and malthusians have historically been antagonistic towards each other, i find that their respective explanations for poverty are logically congruent, despite their differing psychological and ideological stances.
i have written two papers exploring this theme.
the first paper, chapter 8, delves into carrying capacity and emerged from my experiences at the world bank, addressing practical policy questions in paraguay and ecuador that were often overlooked.
chapter 9 serves as a follow-up to this exploration.
both chapters serve as empirical case studies, offering a more practical angle compared to the rest of the book.
simultaneously, shaping immigration policies and ensuring the adherence to current regulations to prevent illegal immigration have emerged as contentious political topics, notably in california and florida.
reductions in welfare provisions have led to a growing reluctance among underprivileged citizens to extend these benefits to undocumented migrants, who are also vying for the same job opportunities and driving down wages.
consequently, this has triggered a justifiable frustration over the perceived lack of government action in upholding immigration statutes and regrettably fostered antipathy towards certain immigrant groups.
given the substantial population growth, any attempt to preserve the amazon by restricting settlement is likely to fail.
confronting millions of economically disadvantaged individuals with the message that the preservation of nature outweighs their basic needs seems unrealistic.
even from an ethical standpoint, prioritizing environmental conservation over human lives would not be accepted on a political level due to the intense pressure for colonization.
the impoverished communities might argue that if safeguarding the ecosystem holds more value than their livelihoods, it should also be considered more important than the wealth of the affluent.
consequently, calls for wealth redistribution would escalate.
the wealthy, safeguarding their own interests, would advocate for exploiting the amazon to delay redistribution demands.
with a projected increase of 10 million people in the next twenty-five years, it appears improbable to save the ecuadorian amazon from devastation or to prevent significant suffering.
only a country that clearly views its options as national survival versus national liquidation would dare to implement such a drastic program.
this viewpoint is not shared by the government of ecuador or its majority citizens, including major environmental organizations in ecuador focused on preserving the amazon's biodiversity, who avoid grappling with the population issue.
however, if present trends persist for twenty-five years, ecuador will face a fate similar to haiti.
the ecuadoran government, along with multilateral development banks, fails to recognize this impending crisis.
a nation on the path to environmental devastation will struggle to repay loans as it lacks creditworthiness.
ecuador requires a restructuring of old debts rather than accruing new ones unless the new debt is channeled into more sustainable and productive investments.
unfortunately, relief of past debts seems unlikely as long as petroleum revenues are used for consumption rather than renewable alternatives.
ecuador potentially downplays the severity of its situation due to the willingness of development banks to provide additional loans.
from ecuador's perspective, being considered creditworthy by these banks implies that the situation may not be as dire as perceived.
the fact that ecuador can secure loans at interest rates without implementing severe measures could be seen as an indication of its creditworthiness.
this mutual optimism between ecuador and the development banks provides reassurance to both parties.
however, neither party has fully confronted the harsh realities of the situation at hand.
there is a high probability of failure attributed to ecological factors.
from a political perspective, the chaco colonization may be viewed as a means to mitigate existing land disputes in the east, delay addressing issues related to population control, sustain a temporary façade of advancement and hope, and provide a significant national initiative to rally public backing.
the practical considerations regarding the region's carrying capacity may not hold much sway against the political benefits outlined above.
the components of a pragmatic approach for paraguay would likely align closely with those identified for ecuador.
in both scenarios, the basic estimation of carrying capacity has effectively highlighted the severity of the situation.
despite their simplicity and roughness, the deductions drawn from these calculations are robust, as a deliberate overestimation was adopted when assessing carrying capacity.
adding more sophisticated econometric models for policy purposes would offer little value beyond what is already evident.
what is fundamentally lacking is not greater precision in data but the political determination to acknowledge the ecological rationale behind historically low population densities, whether in the ecuadorian amazon or the paraguayan chaco, and to adjust human populations accordingly.
the variability of human carrying capacity does not negate the significant and conflicting challenges expected in both cases over the next generation.
additionally, the impracticality of a "hong kong solution" – involving importing food for a densely populated area by exporting manufactured goods and financial services – is evident for both the ecuadorian amazon and the paraguayan chaco, particularly due to their remote locations.
the intention is not to suggest that carrying capacity is exclusively pertinent to developing nations.
the united states of america, had it considered carrying capacity, might not have grown so perilously reliant on dwindling petroleum resources from foreign countries.
if the us struggles to implement a modest gasoline tax to curb unsustainable consumption, is it fair to assume that paraguay and ecuador can effectively manage their populations?
while these measures may seem implausible politically in the near term, neglecting them is unfeasible from a biophysical standpoint in the long term, even within a timeframe as short as twenty-five years.
it is important to acknowledge the limitations of using either total family income or family income per capita.
as highlighted by wood and carvalho, larger households typically have higher total incomes due to more earners, yet lower incomes per household member.
grouping households by income per capita reveals greater differentials in fertility and income inequality compared to grouping based on total household income.
both categories are distinct concepts, neither inherently biased.
it is crucial to understand their definitions and refrain from conflating them when making comparisons.
the initial disbelief that many nordestinos feel towards these figures might suggest a tendency to overlook the underlying social realities they represent rather than providing a basis to question their accuracy.
this was the perspective shared by certain individuals at the ibge in rio de janeiro, upon learning about the skepticism prevalent among my peers in ceara.
nevertheless, both supporters and skeptics alike should delve deeper into this topic, as it warrants further examination.
joao lyra madeira brought up a significant question a few years back, highlighting the apparent lack of attention given to the topic of fertility in brazilian demography and economics.
although the term "taboo" may now seem too extreme, there still exists a reluctance to delve into the socio-economic aspects of fertility.
when a subject is deemed taboo, it often points to an evident injustice that is too important for the status quo to openly confront.
this reluctance to address fertility issues in brazil is reminiscent of the segregated southern united states during my childhood.
the clear divide between the tasks and economic status of blacks and whites was apparent even to a child, with segregation laws enforcing and perpetuating these disparities.
implicit acknowledgment of such inequalities was tolerated as long as it was not overly scrutinized or discussed in depth.
the oligarchy finds it inconvenient as it reveals a different aspect of class exploitation.
while one might expect marxists to be keen on exposing such facts, they are reluctant to acknowledge any reasons for poverty besides the exclusive ownership of the means of production.
marxists particularly dislike neo-malthusian approaches as they suggest improvements can be made through individual efforts, undermining class unity and detracting from their primary solution to all problems, the class revolution.
as a result, this topic is often overlooked by them.
due to the lack of attention, the substantial fertility disparities in northeast brazil still lack a satisfactory explanation.
it is my belief that the root cause can be attributed to the societal class structure.
in my previous studies from 1970 and 1971, i posited that the essence of a proletariat is to have numerous offspring.
in ancient rome, the term "proletariat" denoted the poorest social class, characterized by having many children, who were exempt from taxes and primarily contributed to the nation by producing offspring.
this original connotation, later diminished in meaning by marx's era, tied poverty to rapid population growth.
marx redefined the term to refer to individuals who do not own the means of production and must sell their labor to capitalists for survival, effectively severing the historical link with prolific procreation.
marx's definition implicitly includes a theory of poverty, suggesting that poverty results from the control of production means by a small group and the resulting lack of ownership of these means by the majority.
although the two schools of thought conflict in attributing a singular cause and solution to poverty, there is no inherent contradiction between marxian and malthusian theories.
it is feasible for a group to control both production means and population limiting resources.
marx emphasizes that mere ownership of land and capital does not automatically make someone a landlord or a capitalist without the corresponding social context, such as proletarians dependent on selling their labor.
the rapid increase in such dependent individuals reinforces the unequal distribution of wealth in northeast brazil, a defining characteristic of its social structure.
by 1977, the disparity in life expectancy based on social class in the northeast had decreased to approximately 15 years.
the most significant change, a reduction of nearly 11 years, was observed between the income brackets of "half to one minimum wage" and "one to two minimum wages." conversely, the most notable shift in fertility rates during that period occurred between the preceding categories of "below half minimum wage" and "half to one minimum wage." interestingly, the decline in birth rates preceded that of the mortality rate as income levels rose, contradicting the notion that birth rates decline only in response to decreasing death rates.
while class-based mortality gaps were less stark than fertility variations and lacked a clear-cut threshold at a specific income level, they played a crucial role in painting a comprehensive picture of class distinctions in society.
in short, the demographics of class in northeast brazil highlighted nuanced interplays between mortality and fertility dynamics within different income strata.
additional backing for the second perspective can be derived from several official public statements.
in 1982, a research team from the escola superior de guerra released a concise publication titled "the brazilian demographic problem," embodying the official stance, as evidenced by the subsequent excerpts.
a nation as vast as brazil, boasting extraordinary natural riches, ample prosperity, and free of discrimination based on race, color, or faith, necessitates a populace capable of inhabiting and safeguarding its lands from external covetousness.
the conventional principles of free trade and comparative advantage used to strongly influence my thinking and were the hardest for me to reject.
it is not unexpected that some sympathetic readers disagree with me on the topic of free trade.
nonetheless, i am confident that the same reasons that led me to reevaluate these doctrines will also persuade others to do the same.
our uncritical embrace of all things global and cosmopolitan, while simultaneously devaluing national and local aspects, has been excessive.
in 1987-1988, during the collaborative work on our book "for the common good," john cobb jolted me from my entrenched beliefs on trade matters.
despite having taught the theory of comparative advantage for two decades, the issue had seemed settled until then.
john's prompting led me to reevaluate the entire topic, prompting a revisit to ricardo's theories.
much to my dismay, i realized how extensively i, along with the textbooks i used, had disregarded ricardo's crucial assumption of immobile capital between nations, which forms the crux of the comparative advantage principle.
in chapter ii of our book, we advocate against free trade, championing community, particularly the national community.
i admit, at first, i anticipated severe critiques and errors pointed out by fellow economists, yet over the past seven years, this has not materialized.
the significance of the limited range of occupational choices for a specific group is often overlooked as a welfare cost, though it holds crucial importance.
individual happiness is heavily influenced not just by how one earns a living but also by how they choose to spend their earnings.
take for instance a nation like uruguay, which has a distinct advantage in cattle and sheep farming.
in a scenario strictly following the specialization and trade principle, a resident might have the option of pursuing a career as a cowboy or a shepherd.
however, to maintain a thriving national community, uruguayans have found it essential to establish their own legal, financial, medical, insurance, and educational services in addition to basic agriculture and industry.
despite potentially reducing efficiency, such a diversity of occupations is vital for the unity and identity of the community.
from an individualistic standpoint, the expanded array of occupational choices must be viewed as a welfare improvement.
countries that have weakened their borders due to economic reasons find it challenging to implement domestic policies, including commitments made to support international environmental agreements they have ratified.
these agreements are a stride towards fostering a genuine global community.
however, their significance diminishes when nations relinquish their compliance ability by eroding their borders in favor of unrestricted trade.
transnational corporations have evaded their community obligations by operating on an international scale.
as there is no established global community, they have effectively sidestepped these responsibilities.
globalism, rather than fostering a sense of global community, promotes individualism on a vast scale.
the dilemma lies in whether to allow transnational capital to operate without constraints, establish an international governing body to regulate it, or opt to reassert control over capital by nationalizing it and reintegrating it into the national community.
personally, i advocate for the latter option.
while envisioning this change might be challenging presently, the same holds true for the other options.
the occurrence of an international market crash could potentially make it easier to envision and implement such a transformation.
as national borders become more permeable to the flow of goods, capital, and labor, a global labor market, capital market, and market for goods and services emerge.
consequently, each commodity will have a unified world price.
individual countries can no longer enforce unique wage, interest rate, full-cost pricing, or population control policies without global cooperation.
rather than various nations experimenting with different policies independently, there is now a singular global experiment.
this shift towards standardized competition risks failure due to the downward pressure on standards.
two instances illustrate the challenge of addressing national issues in the context of free trade.
firstly, attempting to transition u.s. citizens from welfare to sustainable employment becomes increasingly difficult when they are immediately exposed to competition from the less privileged global population.
pressing disadvantaged members of our community to transition directly from welfare to competing against abundant and inexpensive labor worldwide neglects our duty to support and stand in solidarity with them.
a similar challenge arises when attempting to transition our military production capacity to civilian uses, especially when facing strong foreign competition.
the inefficiency of our military sector is likened to that of centrally planned socialist economies, highlighting the need for a gradual introduction of competition.
rather than pursuing rapid global efficiency that could result in job losses and societal issues such as increased crime, drug abuse, and irresponsible behaviors, it is advocated to support domestic workers and companies making modest yet valuable contributions to our nation despite current global competitiveness levels.
the introduction of trade initially reduces environmental constraints compared to total economic self-sufficiency (autarky), giving the impression that increased trade will further alleviate these constraints.
however, the advantages of transitioning from no trade to some trade do not automatically imply that more trade is superior to less trade.
moreover, it is not feasible for all countries to solely rely on importing natural resources.
free trade amplifies the geographical distance between the advantages of production and the environmental drawbacks of growth in throughput.
this disparity makes it challenging to assess and more likely to exceed the ideal scale dictated by their equilibrium at the margin.
additionally, due to heightened connectivity from trade, nations will encounter increasingly stringent global environmental limitations concurrently rather than gradually on a national level.
this contrasts with a scenario of reduced trade and integration where countries would experience more sequential and localized environmental restrictions.
consequently, there will be fewer chances to experiment on a smaller scope and draw insights from other nations' past endeavors in managing throughput.
overall, through the simultaneous availability of resources and absorption capacities to meet demands globally, free trade is likely to boost throughput growth, consequently accelerating environmental degradation.
it may diminish the ability of local communities to manage their surroundings and sustain their means of living.
while neoclassical growth economics perceive the increase in throughput growth spurred by free trade as advantageous, sustainable or steady-state economics view any inclination of trade to drive growth above an optimal level as uneconomic.
however, proponents of free trade stress the significance of strengthening intellectual property rights and reducing the accessibility of knowledge as a common good.
they argue that without making new knowledge costly, there would be insufficient motivation to create more of it.
despite the persuasive nature of this argument, i am inclined to support the idea that the advantages of swiftly sharing existing knowledge outweigh the potential drawbacks of hindering the generation of new knowledge.
drawing from schumpeter's theories, one could posit that new knowledge initially holds a natural but temporary monopoly due to its novelty.
by disseminating knowledge, the loss of this exclusivity drives the pursuit of even newer knowledge.
the practical worth of fresh knowledge is attributed to the production factors that implement it, while its market value is driven down to zero through competition.
assessing welfare is complex and prone to numerous subjective considerations, underscoring the importance of avoiding broad generalizations.
nevertheless, it appears reasonable to suggest that there is scant empirical support for the notion that gross national product (gnp) growth has significantly enhanced welfare in the united states since 1947.
consequently, any potential welfare improvements resulting from free trade's role in bolstering gnp growth are likely to be minimal.
essentially, upon closer examination, the touted substantial benefits that supposedly necessitate sacrificing national cohesion and industrial harmony seem to be nonexistent.
ricardo demonstrated the concept of free trade being mutually beneficial even in cases where there were substantial one-sided differences in production costs between countries.
he used the example of england and portugal in the eighteenth century to illustrate this.
portugal was able to produce both wine and cloth at a lower cost compared to england.
however, england's efficiency in the cloth industry far surpassed that of portugal's, while portugal excelled in producing wine.
despite portugal's absolute advantage in both products, england had a comparative advantage in cloth production, while portugal had a comparative advantage in wine production.
ricardo argued that both countries would benefit by specializing in their respective comparative advantage products and engaging in trade.
this approach, rather than focusing on absolute advantages, would result in mutual benefits through free trade and competition within each country.
irrespective of what ricardo might argue if he were alive today, some contemporary neoclassical economists could still advocate for free trade based on absolute advantage rather than comparative advantage.
they may still demonstrate that overall global output would increase through specialization and trade under absolute advantage, though not guaranteeing that each country would necessarily benefit.
this was the crux of the matter.
classical economists, being nationalists, were primarily concerned with the benefit of their own nations and were not particularly keen on global integration or trade that did not directly favor their countries.
with the progression of global integration, the concept of "each nation" loses its economic significance.
nonetheless, neoclassical economists are not troubled by this shift as they prioritize individualism over nationalism.
apologies, aging union worker joe six-pack, but in today's interconnected global economy, companies like mine can outsource labor overseas for a fraction of the wages demanded by your union.
by avoiding higher environmental and social taxes, we can then market and sell our products competitively.
your severance package is being processed.
as for your mention of "bonds of national community," i must disagree.
the reality is that we now operate within a global economic framework, transcending the nationalistic sentiments that led to historic conflicts.
the movement of factors is crucial for attaining peak productivity, a vital aspect for staying viable amidst global competition.
while there may indeed be a trend towards the convergence of wages worldwide, it's imperative to recognize that profits will also harmonize.
consequently, wages may trend downwards while profits trend upwards, reflecting the equilibrium dictated by global supply and demand dynamics.
wouldn't you agree, joe, that striving for equality in wealth across all workers, be they chinese, mexican, or american, is the humane path forward?
let's not harbor any prejudiced views.
at this point in the conversation, there is a diminishing sense of community.
what is being observed is the nullification of a fundamental social contract between labor and capital regarding the equitable division of the value they collectively contribute to raw materials.
this accord hasn't been established on economic principles but rather through years of national discussions, voting, labor disputes, company shutdowns, legal judgments, and confrontations.
the rejection of this pact, crucial for national unity and industrial harmony, is now occurring in favor of worldwide integration.
this exchange, labeled as "free" trade, is deemed highly unfavorable.
the concept of free trade, when mistakenly expanded to include unrestricted capital flow, logically suggests that it should also extend to unrestricted labor movement, specifically through open immigration policies.
if we consider ourselves part of a global economy, why should there be limitations?
if both capital and the governments supporting it have no greater allegiance to their own citizens than to foreigners, then the freedom to migrate should be allowed.
the unrestricted movement of goods, capital, and labor is a direct outcome of global economic integration.
while this may not align with the original intentions of economists like ricardo or smith when discussing free trade, it now represents the implicit or explicit agenda of contemporary advocates of free trade.
however, this approach undermines national unity rather than fostering it and does not necessarily promote international cooperation either.
according to jim hightower, a former texas commissioner of agriculture, a potential solution could be to retain manufacturing facilities and job opportunities in the united states while relocating corporate headquarters to countries like mexico or korea to source cost-effective chief executives.
another proposition could involve liberalizing immigration policies to allow entry of affordable executive talent and labor force.
nevertheless, the reality may lean towards further marginalization of the working class, accentuated by corporate and academic elitism towards less educated and rural populations, with a corresponding increase in the emphasis on firearms as a defining element of identity among the former group.
the concept of free trade, specialization, and global integration has made it almost impossible for nations to opt out of trading.
however, the freedom to choose not to trade is important for ensuring that trade continues to be mutually advantageous.
emphasizing the idea that national production for the domestic market should take priority over international trade is crucial.
some free trade proponents advocate for intertwining the two so tightly that it could ultimately stifle domestic production in favor of a global approach.
this idealistic vision of a perfectly orchestrated international trade system might end up causing chaos and intense conflicts, both globally and within nations, rather than the intended harmonious outcome.
while there may be additional criteria for adjustment, these three typically encompass the majority of cases known as "adjustment lending." these loans are primarily used to fund changes in policies focusing on the rationalization of prices, addressing macroeconomic issues such as debt and deficits, and promoting the liberalization of international trade.
the rationale for a country resorting to borrowing money at interest to implement more sound national policies may not always be immediately apparent.
some view adjustment lending as a form of incentive, albeit for a noble cause.
the underlying belief is that the benefits of policy changes, akin to any investment, will outweigh the costs of loan interest, ultimately contributing more to national welfare in the long run.
certainly, if all trading nations were to reach a consensus on shared regulations for defining, assessing, and incorporating external costs, the stated concern would no longer be valid, thereby reestablishing the traditional arguments in favor of free trade within this new framework.
however, the likelihood of such collective agreement remains uncertain.
even the limited group of expert national income accountants cannot reach a consensus on the assessment of environmental costs within national accounts, let alone on the strategies for integrating these costs into firm-level pricing.
it is improbable that policymakers will fare any better in this regard.
some economists may oppose universal cost integration by pointing out that countries have varying preferences for environmental goods and services, which should justify profitable trade based on differential pricing.
undoubtedly, reaching a consensus on standardized principles and the degree of deviation permissible from these principles will present formidable challenges.
once capital can move freely, the concept of comparative advantage and its associated illustrations lose their significance.
the outcome of capital mobility mirrors that of international labor mobility, leading to a tendency to harmonize wages worldwide.
given the current issue of overpopulation and rapid demographic growth in developing countries, it is evident that this alignment will push wages downwards, as observed in the united states over the past decade.
consequently, under free trade and capital mobility, returns on capital are also expected to be leveled, albeit at a higher scale than now.
american capital stands to gain from inexpensive foreign labor, succeeded by low-cost domestic labor, at least until hindered by a demand crisis caused by insufficient purchasing power from reduced wages.
nevertheless, this can be prevented by efficiently redistributing resources to cater to the new spending patterns resulting from the growing income disparity.
the objective of sustainable development is to progress towards a future where development benefits all individuals across all generations through modifications in resource allocation, distribution, and magnitude.
however, achieving this goal requires more than just minor adjustments to the conventional growth model, which has largely contributed to the current stalemate.
libertarian economists often view homo economicus as an independent entity with unlimited mobility, comfortable in any environment.
however, actual individuals reside within communities, which are interconnected with other communities.
their unique identities are shaped by their connections within these communities.
treating community as a dispensable collection of temporarily proximate individuals, solely to benefit mobile capital, is problematic enough when capital remains within national borders.
the situation escalates when capital crosses international boundaries.
free trade does not eliminate carrying capacity limitations; rather, it ensures that countries will encounter these constraints more or less simultaneously instead of one after the other.
it consolidates various local limitations into a unified global constraint, thereby transforming a series of manageable issues into a single, overwhelming challenge.
the misconception surrounding this concept is evident when individuals, who are expected to possess better understanding, use the netherlands or hong kong as models that all nations should follow, claiming that every country could achieve the same high population density.
however, it remains unclear how all countries could achieve the status of being net exporters of goods while also being net importers of carrying capacity.
a subsystem is limited in its growth by the total system it belongs to.
if the total system offers services that the subsystem cannot provide independently, the subsystem should refrain from encroaching on the main system in a manner that could hinder its ability to deliver these services.
it is essential for the economy to operate within the bounds of the ecosystem's capacity to sustainably provide services like photosynthesis, pollination, air and water purification, climate maintenance, uv radiation filtration, waste recycling, and more.
prioritizing growth over sustainability has led us to exceed a viable scale.
in order to sustain the current population size and per capita consumption levels, we are depleting natural resources and categorizing it as income.
trying to alleviate poverty through continued expansion of resource consumption will ultimately backfire once the environmental costs exceed the production benefits.
it is highly probable that we have already surpassed this critical threshold, where further growth actually reduces wealth instead of increasing it.
an alternative approach involves halting the expansion of resource consumption and addressing poverty through redistribution and enhancing the efficiency of resource utilization rather than merely increasing the quantity of resources used.
by restricting resource consumption, efforts can be directed towards enhancing resource efficiency.
if technological advancements can substantially enhance efficiency, the transition may be relatively smooth.
however, if technological progress is limited, the process will be more challenging.
regardless, it is imperative to pursue this approach whether one is optimistic or pessimistic about technological advancements.
in an attempt to evade these truths, adherents of the adjustment paradigm have introduced another adjustment termed sustainable growth, adding to the confusion by wrongly equating it with sustainable development.
adhering to the correct definitions, "growth" pertains to a quantitative increase in physical size through the assimilation of materials, while "development" signifies qualitative change, realizing potential, or transitioning to a more enhanced state.
these two processes are distinct yet interconnected, as evident in examples like simultaneous growth and development in a child, mere growth without development as seen in a snowball or cancer, and development occurring without growth, like in the case of the planet earth.
economies often experience concurrent growth and development, though they can occur independently as well.
as the economy is a part of a limited and unexpanding ecosystem, its expansion causes it to encompass an increasingly larger portion of the entire system, making its operations resemble those of the full system, which entails development without further expansion.
the acknowledgment that continual growth becomes unattainable and increasingly burdensome is what underscores the importance of sustainable development.
this concept entails advancing without enlarging the economy beyond a threshold that remains within the carrying capacity of the biosphere.
many believe that the current scale exceeds the long-term carrying capacity, and to achieve sustainable growth, it may be necessary to experience a phase of negative growth initially.
even for those inclined towards technological optimism, who anticipate that productivity improvements in resource usage may outpace the reduction in resource volume, this notion remains quite radical.
the term "sustainable growth" is seen as an attempt to avoid this profound transformation and instead implies that growth is still the primary objective, albeit with a slightly improved environmental focus.
in contrast, sustainable development offers an alternative to the conventional growth paradigm and is fundamentally incompatible with it.
sustainable development, characterized by progress without growth, does not signify the demise of economics; if anything, it elevates the significance of economics.
this approach embodies a nuanced and intricate economic model centered on maintenance, enhancing quality, resource sharing, frugality, and adapting to natural constraints.
it advocates for a philosophy of "better, not bigger" economics.
the accumulation of physical assets acts as a support in enhancing our capacity to access energy income, provided they are protected from the effects of entropy.
however, the energy income itself cannot be significantly expanded nor conserved extensively.
preserving our stock of physical wealth against the impact of entropy necessitates a continuous supply of low-entropy "revenue." while nature has deposited energy in coal over vast geological timescales, we can only extract it.
soddy viewed the period of extravagant coal consumption as transient, with the limitations of depending on energy income becoming more apparent and undeniable once the coal reserves were depleted.
soddy seems to argue that if it is impractical for an entire community to subsist solely on interest, then it should similarly be discouraged for individuals based on principles of equity.
allowing unchecked individual accumulation of debt eventually leads to a scenario where debt holders exceed the future capacity of revenue producers to meet those obligations, resulting in conflicts such as debt defaults.
while debt, fueled by compound interest, can theoretically persist indefinitely, the physical constraints of wealth—subject to the realities of entropy—prevent limitless growth.
as debt compounds exponentially yet wealth growth is ultimately finite, a point of imbalance between the two is inevitable, requiring some form of debt repudiation or cancellation.
the subtitle of his later work, "the bearing of physical science upon state stewardship," is the only indication of the significant and innovative contribution he made to economics.
it is noteworthy that soddy foresaw the fundamental ideas of georgescu-roegen and boulding concerning the connection between economics and thermodynamics.
as a result, he should be acknowledged as a trailblazer in a school of thought that i predict will gain prominence in the future.
the initial question may seem logical, albeit extraneous, as soddy did not propose benefiting from compound interest without reinvesting some of the interest earned.
nevertheless, the latter portion of the inquiry indicates a misunderstanding between tangible and abstract quantities, leaving soddy potentially disheartened about bridging the gap with economists.
it is possible that when professor silverman used the term "approximately," he intended to convey "for a set duration." yet, this raises queries about the conclusion of this specified period and its duration.
georgescu-roegen's impact on the field of economics can be divided into the categories of normal science and revolutionary science, concepts popularized by philosopher thomas kuhn.
his normal science contributions encompass essential research in utility and consumer choice, measurability, expectations, production theory, input-output analysis, and economic development.
he was a trailblazer in mathematical economics, and although his work was groundbreaking at the time, it is now considered normal science as a result of the success of the revolution it sparked.
his revolutionary science contributions, particularly his pioneering work in the entropy law and the economic process, are still met with opposition from the prevailing paradigm, a paradigm georgescu himself played a role in establishing.
while some of his students may opt to focus on his earlier contributions to mainstream economics, i have chosen to highlight his groundbreaking contributions, which i believe hold greater significance and relevance to ecological economics.
it concerns me that, even decades after the publication of key works such as the entropy law and the economic process and the introductory essay to analytical economics, their impact is not evident in standard economics textbooks.
scholars in various disciplines outside of economics have recognized the value of georgescu's later work, prompting questions as to why economists have not embraced it more fully.
the lack of integration of these ideas cannot be attributed to their inability to withstand critique from within the field.
georgescu was not only a distinguished fellow of the american economic association but was also praised by paul samuelson in 1965.
in his preface to analytical economics, samuelson referred to georgescu as a "scholar's scholar" and an "economist's economist." this accolade was not limited to georgescu's established scientific work featured in analytical economics but also extended to the groundbreaking introductory essay that laid the foundation for his later pivotal work, the entropy law and the economic process.
samuelson challenged economists to reflect on this essay, stating, "i defy any informed economist to remain complacent after meditating over this essay." despite samuelson's endorsement, most economists remained indifferent.
surprisingly, even in samuelson's widely used textbook almost three decades later, there is no mention of the ideas presented in georgescu's essay.
naturally, an introductory text does not delve into complex themes, and it is not surprising that georgescu's intricate advancements in traditional economics are not referenced.
nevertheless, his groundbreaking perspectives on economics and entropy are quite straightforward due to their fundamental nature.
the comprehension of these basic concepts does not demand a technical explanation of the entropy law.
thus, these foundational ideas could feasibly be incorporated into an introductory text.
however, the challenge lies in the fact that their incorporation would necessitate substantial revisions across the text, given the far-reaching implications that challenge conventional perspectives.
the section focusing on national income accounting, along with its guidelines on evaluating the circular flow, could be enhanced by incorporating a quantified measure of the entropic flow, known as "gross national throughput." furthermore, this segment might address the peculiar imbalance evident in current national accounts.
while the depreciation of man-made assets is deducted from current production, there is no equivalent deduction for the depletion of natural assets.
this discrepancy allows for a situation where a nation could deplete its mines, destroy its forests, degrade its topsoil, and deplete its wildlife and fisheries to extinction, leading to a consistent rise in measured income despite the loss of these vital resources.
centering the analysis on the entropic flow underscores the importance of recognizing the natural capital assets responsible for generating this crucial flow.
it highlights the definition of income according to hicks, which refers to the highest level of consumption an individual or community can sustain over a period while maintaining the same level of well-being from the beginning to the end.
the preservation of capital now encompasses both natural and man-made resources in order to sustain the same level of well-being.
in our revised section on population, we would focus on reevaluating the notion of optimum population.
instead of merely considering the number of individuals, we would delve into contemplating the duration for which a certain population level is sustainable.
specifically, we aim to determine the ideal population size, longevity, and corresponding per capita resource consumption that would optimize the total duration of human existence, while ensuring a satisfactory quality of life for all individuals.
i conclude with a wish for my work to undergo thorough yet fair evaluation.
i firmly emphasize this request as i have had to contend with challenging misconceptions that are widely accepted as truth, which have become deeply ingrained for numerous individuals due to their livelihoods being tied, in part or in whole, to these beliefs.
renouncing these notions would thrust them into a circumstance similar to mine, where they would have to seek new opportunities at an advanced stage in life.
embracing sustainable development requires a profound shift in mindset, a genuine transformation of beliefs, and a sincere readiness for self-reflection.
these notions are rooted in religious language with a purpose - challenging us to reconsider our core values on a profound level that inherently leans towards the spiritual.
interestingly, within the academic world, there is often a reluctance to acknowledge this inherent religious undertone, as labeling an issue as religious can lead to its dismissal or marginalization.
the notion of repentance, once a powerful call to action, has been replaced by a more neutral and detached term - "change." this shift reflects a broader societal trend of avoiding overtly subjective terms like "progress" in favor of a more objective and value-free approach.
ultimately, the expectation is for individuals to adapt or at least not resist these changes, emphasizing a subtle shift from values-driven progress to a more passive acceptance of objective transformations.
the initial chapter of this section delves into the concept of limited inequality and asserts its solid biblical foundation.
while it may appear conventional to rely on biblical authority to uphold an ethical principle, as opposed to the contemporary academic trend favoring figures like john rawls, robert nozick, and amartya sen or concepts such as the social contract, historical evidence suggests that a significant portion of the moral principles embraced in the united states originated from the bible.
these principles were disseminated across the nation by churches and universities, many of which were originally established by protestant churches, although little evidence of this heritage remains in most modern universities.
for those who prefer to anchor ethical principles in culture and history, our culture and history predominantly offer various interpretations of the bible as foundations for ethical values.
hence, there is no need to justify basing a moral principle directly on the bible rather than indirectly through our diminishing cultural legacy.
advocating against enforced equality, no one is proposing an unwarranted scenario of equal distribution.
a tenfold difference in wealth could be deemed acceptable due to variations in work ethic and dedication, serving as motivation to encourage such qualities.
for a more cautious approach, one might argue for a twentyfold difference.
nonetheless, societal bonds start to fracture at or even before a hundredfold inequality.
the seeds of class warfare are already being sown.
the attachment of numerous individuals from rural and working-class backgrounds to their firearms, and the subsequent influence of the national rifle association, emanates from an implicit yet profound sentiment that "even though the government may view me as an uneducated, blue-collar individual, there are limits to how much they can oppress me if i possess firearms.
without them, there are no boundaries." while acknowledging the presence of political and religious extremity in these militia groups, they also signify a manifestation of class strife stemming from widening wealth gaps.
it is essential to establish a systematic approach that connects religious beliefs with economic principles.
this connection should be universal and foundational to bridge the gap between the agricultural economies of biblical palestine and the roman empire to today's advanced industrial economies.
in this chapter, i aim to interpret a particular and revolutionary economic principle rooted in the context of the old and new testaments.
the final chapter delves into a broader exploration of the religious context, proposing that the key aspects of sustainable development economics organically emerge from and are intrinsically supported by a religious worldview.
in today's agricultural practices, it seems unreasonable for farmers to refrain from harvesting the corners of their fields to accommodate travelers, strangers, widows, and orphans.
though this custom may be considered outdated, its underlying principle remains relevant: to provide for the less fortunate.
while traditional methods become obsolete, there is a need to identify more appropriate approaches.
furthermore, the demographics of those in need have shifted over time, with widows and orphans often being financially stable heirs.
it might be more apt to refer to the disadvantaged groups as "unmarried heads of households" in contemporary census terms, highlighting the changing face of poverty.
i suggest focusing on a fundamental biblical economic principle that, in my opinion, is straightforward to grasp and crucial for improved institutionalization in today's society.
this principle also aligns partially with the requirements for a sustainable economy.
i will begin by outlining the principle, demonstrating that it was indeed the primary economic guideline for the communities whose beliefs are reflected in the hebrew scriptures and that its importance is reinforced in the new testament.
next, i will propose a novel institution to effectively reintegrate this principle into the contemporary economy.
finally, i will explore additional implications of the principle and its significance for a steady-state economy.
the concept of the "eleventh commandment" implies that private property and some level of inequality in its allocation are accepted.
however, it emphasizes that this inequality should have boundaries.
before delving into these boundaries, it is essential to briefly discuss the validity of private property, which is sometimes debated.
both christianity and judaism view individuals as autonomous beings capable of making decisions and facing the consequences.
private property is crucial as it expands the domain for personal freedom and accountability.
moreover, the eighth commandment, "thou shalt not steal," is sometimes interpreted as indirectly endorsing the idea of private property.
although total equality was not a reality or objective, the community could not tolerate extreme inequality.
there were defined limits on the extent of inequality.
firstly, land distribution among families was either equal or fair in a broader sense.
secondly, since property is essential for freedom and accountability, it is reasonable for everyone to possess some form of property or at least have the right to gather crops and utilize resources, a diluted form of ownership.
conversely, the traditional argument for private property stands as a safeguard to shield individuals from exploitation by others.
property owners have the autonomy to sustain themselves and are not compelled to agree to unfavorable employment terms.
if the legitimacy of property rests on these grounds, then it is evident that ownership should be widespread, if not universal.
according to the book of leviticus, the acceptable level of inequality was limited to what could amass over fifty years, starting with an equitable initial allocation, and adhering to principles of honesty, no interest, fallow sabbatical, protection of the impoverished, religious contributions, and similar guidelines.
the jubilee, marking the fiftieth year as a grand sabbath, was a time to revert to the original distribution.
the presence and prospect of the jubilee year tended to curb the rapid build-up of inequalities that it aimed to rectify.
as the jubilee year neared, the drive to amass wealth lessened, knowing that gains would need to be relinquished.
post-jubilee, with 49 years to enjoy the gains, the drive to accumulate peaked, aligning with a period of equal distribution.
it is essential to acknowledge that there is no universally defined limit to inequality that is of divine authority.
does this mean our efforts are futile?
just like how a democracy doesn't have a precise and absolute standard for determining the appropriate voting age, as it's subjective whether it should be set at eighteen or twenty-two.
the crucial point is that the specific age limit is somewhat arbitrary.
what truly matters is having a clearly defined and widely accepted minimum age, regardless of whether it is eighteen or twenty-two.
similarly, the precise boundaries of inequality are less significant compared to establishing limits that align with a reasonable, functional, and fair level of inequality.
the crucial question is: what constitutes this acceptable and functional range?
the baseline income would ideally cover basic needs such as food, shelter, clothing, health, and education, set at a culturally appropriate level.
the upper limit could be ten times higher than this minimum threshold.
while plato proposed a factor of four, i suggest ten as a suitable benchmark.
what is the precise extent of inequality and how is income distributed in reality?
economists rely on various tools like lorenz curves, gini coefficients, pareto distributions, and lognormal distributions to characterize income distribution.
yet, a particularly vivid and creative depiction was proposed by dutch economist jan pen, who illustrates this concept by organizing a procession of dwarfs and giants.
in this visual, all earners are either reduced or enlarged to reflect the size of their income.
they will then march past us in a parade, from shortest to tallest, spanning precisely one hour, providing an intriguing perspective for us, individuals of assumed average stature.
what would we see in this scenario?
initially, there are individuals with a negative height, possibly with their heads buried up to ten yards underground.
these individuals experienced financial losses that year; they are not necessarily destitute but may face financial struggles if losses persist.
following them are numerous gnomes, each roughly the size of a matchstick.
among them are part-time workers, students, and housewives who earn modest incomes, often contributing to a household's overall earnings, thus managing to stay somewhat financially afloat.
this procession of gnomes lasts for approximately five minutes.
subsequently, individuals of noticeably larger stature appear, standing at around three feet tall.
among them are elderly pensioners, divorced women without alimony, individuals with disabilities, and some artists.
this group takes an additional five minutes to pass by.
after fifteen minutes of the ongoing parade, individuals of short stature, standing at four feet tall and described as unskilled workers, start to appear.
among these individuals, many are women and most have dark skin.
the procession continues to showcase dwarfs for an extended period before transitioning to office workers, who although not dwarfs, are notably shorter from our viewpoint.
forty-eight minutes into the parade, twelve minutes before its conclusion, people of average height, representing the middle-income bracket, begin to be visible.
this group includes teachers, civil servants, insurance agents, farmers, and skilled workers.
six minutes later, individuals from the top ten percent, standing at around six feet and six inches tall, start to be seen.
these figures are mostly university graduates.
in the final moments of the parade, towering figures suddenly emerge.
among them are a lawyer, a doctor, and some accountants towering at about eighteen feet tall, followed by doctors, judges, and executives, standing at approximately sixty feet tall.
the procession culminates with the appearance of prince phillip and the director of shell oil, who stand at staggering heights of one hundred and eighty feet and more than double that, respectively.
the query arises as to whether restrictions on income or wealth should be imposed, or if a combination of a minimum income and maximum wealth, as suggested in scripture, would be more appropriate.
considering the options, it is evident that setting a minimum limit on wealth is not feasible since wealth can be spent, making it difficult to maintain year after year.
therefore, the minimum restriction should be placed on income.
the maximum constraint can be set on either income, wealth, or both.
placing a cap on wealth without limiting income could result in extravagant spending by individuals who have exceeded the wealth threshold, potentially escalating consumption inequalities once wealth inequalities are regulated.
this imbalance may contradict the principles of sustainability by promoting excessive consumption.
although setting a cap on income avoids this issue, it may be perceived as exacerbating wealth disparities.
however, upon closer examination, this symmetry proves to be flawed.
imposing restrictions on income will inevitably impact wealth in two significant ways.
firstly, wealth accumulation will slow down when income is restricted.
secondly, individuals whose income from other sources has hit the maximum limit will witness a devaluation of their existing wealth.
this would prompt them to either spend or liquidate their assets since they cannot retain the full benefits.
as a result, it is more effective to set direct limits, both for maximum and minimum levels, on income rather than wealth.
while exploring the feasibility of imposing a cap on wealth is also advisable, the most straightforward and practical approach to address inequality remains the implementation of maximum and minimum thresholds on income.
until now, the concept of limited inequality has been scrutinized within a specific timeframe.
however, should this principle not extend across time as well?
it is essential that the current generation does not amass excessive wealth at the expense of future generations being impoverished.
conversely, depriving the present generation in an attempt to secure disproportionate wealth for future generations should also be avoided.
amidst an era fixated on economic expansion, characterized by prioritizing investment over immediate consumption, there have been sporadic acknowledgments of the latter misstep.
suppose an economy adhered to the ten-to-one limits of inequality but experienced consistent growth in terms of population and per capita consumption.
while the limits to inequality were respected at all times, they would not be sustained over time due to the increasing scale of economic activity.
this growth trajectory could lead to either a significantly wealthier future or a substantial decline resulting from ecological collapse, possibly both in sequence.
the lack of mention of issues like overpopulation and ecological degradation in biblical times limits the specific guidance available in the judeo-christian religious tradition concerning these matters.
in antiquity, sustainability was generally assumed given the predominantly pastoral, agricultural, small-scale, and solar-based economy of ancient israel.
however, various laws promoting sustainable practices such as leaving land fallow, protecting nesting birds, and preserving trees during conflicts suggest that sustainability was not entirely automatic and was not taken for granted.
due to high death rates, the population did not grow rapidly, maintaining the economy at a nearly steady state necessary to revert back to the initial historical circumstances of the jubilee.
in these conditions, it was undeniable that imposing a maximum limit on individual income was necessary, as simply relying on overall prosperity without considering the rate at which the rich and poor became wealthier would be ineffective.
in a steady state scenario, if the wealthy accumulated more wealth, the less privileged would inevitably experience a decline in their financial standing, both relatively and absolutely.
when there is a cap on the overall wealth, it becomes vital to set a maximum limit on individual earnings.
moreover, if a minimum income is also established, generally, the higher the minimum threshold, the lower the maximum limit on income would need to be.
numerous individuals contend that the existence of a stable economy within the community was a fortunate outcome of historical events and not a result of divine intervention.
with the advancements in science and technology, the natural constraints that previously required the economy to remain steady, specifically the imposition of a maximum income, have been eliminated.
advocates propose retaining the minimum income but argue that once poverty is eradicated, concerns about inequality become less pressing.
moreover, some argue that an escalation in inequality may be essential to drive economic growth, subsequently enabling an increase in the minimum income level.
there are two key points to address in response.
firstly, the distance between the wealthy and the impoverished significantly impacts community cohesion.
excessive inequality undermines a sense of community, regardless of the well-being of the lowest economic strata.
even relative poverty fosters resentment, while wealth can isolate and desensitize individuals.
the bonds of conviviality, solidarity, and brotherhood diminish as economic disparities widen.
moreover, relative income often influences political power and must not become too concentrated in either a theocratic or democratic system, as this could pave the way for a plutocracy.
mistakes can occur in any of the three stages.
our religious understanding may be flawed, either lacking sensitivity or veering towards fanaticism.
while a fundamental religious understanding might be accurate, translating it into an ethical principle could still be skewed by historical biases or being overly one-sided.
there is a possibility of making errors in deriving particular economic strategies from a broad principle of ethical conduct.
even if our ethical foundation is solid, misconceptions about the functioning of the world can result in policies producing outcomes contrary to our intentions.
exponential growth, in a remarkably brief timespan, has rapidly transformed our once sparsely populated world into one teeming with people and their possessions.
this transformation, driven by economic progress, has led to a world bustling with human activity and material wealth, yet it has also come at the cost of depleting the natural resources and ecosystems that previously thrived.
this assimilation of nature into our human-made environment, now acknowledged as "natural capital" due to its intrinsic value and limited availability, has ushered in a new phase of growth paradoxically characterized by diminishing returns and escalating environmental degradation.
this detrimental trend, termed "antieconomic growth," results in a situation where the costs of expanding human activities outweigh the associated benefits, thereby exacerbating poverty and endangering the natural world.
despite the illusion of prosperity indicated by rising gross national product (gnp), the well-being of society is on a downward trajectory, underscoring the fallacy of equating material wealth with true prosperity and well-being.
this persistent confusion, perhaps rooted in misplaced priorities or blind allegiance, perpetuates a cycle in which tangible symbols of success are misconstrued as the genuine indicators of human flourishing.
nonreligious individuals may adopt this perspective due to its alignment with empirical knowledge.
conversely, the prevailing alternative viewpoint, endorsed in much of contemporary economic analysis, posits the economy as an all-encompassing system with limitless growth potential.
while acknowledging the finite nature of the environment, this view regards it merely as a component of the economy that can be replaced by other sectors without impeding overall growth significantly.
this perspective is rooted in the belief that humans are essentially creators rather than mere inhabitants of their surroundings.
it is worth noting that while these viewpoints are not explicitly tied to religion, they share a commonality with religious beliefs in that they establish foundational principles that resist straightforward disproof through critical analysis.
their influence over us stems partly from faith and dedication.
viewing the economy as a subsystem differs from the religious belief that the world is god's creation and we, along with our creations, are a part of it and constrained by its limits.
however, this economic perspective is more aligned with the religious insight than the idea of the human economy as the primary system, with nature being just a segment that could be replaced by various other sectors.
the contrasting implications of these preanalytic views are significant: regarding the economy as a subsystem prompts the pursuit of an optimal human niche scale, suggesting growth should halt beyond a certain point, while perceiving the economy as the total system encourages an endless pursuit of growth.
there is an inherent understanding of what constitutes a satisfactory life, although there may be differing opinions on this matter.
it is essential to delve deeper into this concept, as life can be negatively impacted by both poverty and excessive wealth.
establishing reasonable boundaries for inequality is a feasible expectation, despite opposition from economic experts questioning the validity of imposing personal preferences on others.
the argument suggesting that these values are merely subjective tastes and that perpetual growth is feasible is flawed, highlighting the superficiality of the current economic discussions.
however, without forests, a sawmill holds no value; without fish, fishing boats become worthless; without remaining petroleum deposits, refineries are of no value; and without rivers and adequate forest cover in catchment areas to prevent erosion and siltation, dams lose their value.
claims about intergenerational sustainable practices and the supposed efficiency of man-made versus natural capital are merely vague attempts to avoid addressing the underlying moral question.
i am convinced of the continuous existence of god, the creator, in the past, present, and future.
god is the origin of our responsibility towards creation, which includes all living beings, particularly those among us enduring suffering.
our actions that exploit the present, at the expense of future generations and other species, mirror the sinful act of favoring the wealthy over the impoverished.
it is undoubtedly a transgression to return the gift of creation to god in a deteriorated state, with reduced capacity to sustain life abundantly and for generations to come.
just as killing and stealing are considered sins, so too is the destruction of the earth's ability to support life in the present and for future inhabitants.
while it may be unavoidable at times to make choices that result in sacrifices for the future, trading the well-being of future generations for present comfort and luxury is a distinct moral failing.
the initial step in implementing this change involves recognizing, a concept discussed in chapter 2, the existence of three main economic challenges: allocation, distribution, and scale.
these challenges each serve as distinct objectives, and addressing one does not automatically resolve the others.
presently, the approach is to address these challenges in a comprehensive manner.
the first objective concerns allocation, which pertains to the distribution of resources across various commodity uses, such as determining the allocation for cars, bicycles, shoes, and beans.
a desirable allocation is one that efficiently meets people's preferences and purchasing abilities.
efficiency is achieved through the use of relative prices that reflect marginal opportunity costs.
the second objective focuses on distribution, involving allocating final products among different individuals, determining how many bicycles or beans are distributed to each person equitably and adequately.
an optimal distribution is one that maintains fairness and adequacy standards.
to achieve this, policy tools such as transfer payments and limitations on inequality are employed.
today, the issue of optimal scale cannot be disregarded any longer.
in the past, this matter was often overlooked due to the assumption that as long as the scale of operations remained small, economic growth could function as the primary guiding principle of society.
growth was prioritized with the belief that it would eradicate poverty through continuous accumulation facilitated by the miraculous effects of compound interest.
redistribution was considered unnecessary, as it was thought that premature redistribution could impede the momentum of growth.
the concept was that growth would naturally eliminate inefficiencies without the need for adjusting relative prices to encompass all social and environmental costs.
however, there are limits to scale.
there exists a maximum threshold, and well before this threshold, there is an optimal point at which further growth becomes more expensive than beneficial.
a mounting body of evidence suggests that we have already surpassed this optimum scale.
given that the earth is evolving without expanding, it implies that a part of the earth will eventually adapt to this mode of sustainable development, where growth is not the primary focus.
this transition may occur on any level below the earth's carrying capacity.
following ethical principles, the most suitable scale would be the one that maximizes the collective human experience over time, while ensuring a decent quality of life within the limits of available resources per individual.
currently, what is certain is that this ideal scale must be sustainable, avoiding any excessive strain on the ecosystem that could jeopardize future generations.
at this stage, the primary objective is to strive towards achieving a sustainable scale, deferring the question of determining the most optimal sustainable scale for a later time.
the challenges of achieving sustainability encompass both technical and economic aspects, which may not be overly complicated.
the true difficulty lies in breaking free from our addiction to constant growth as the primary means of harnessing our innovative abilities.
whether framed in religious contexts or not, there is a mistaken perception that our creative potential is self-reliant and boundless.
this misguided belief hinders the acknowledgment that combating poverty necessitates recognizing and respecting various constraints.
these include limitations on per capita resource consumption, population expansion, and the proliferation of inequality.
ignoring these natural boundaries results in unsustainable growth that surpasses the earth's capacity, precipitating widespread devastation.
this, in turn, leads to a decline in the overall quality of life, ultimately causing premature mortality among those currently lacking adequate resources.
however, critical academic relativists may highlight that distinct plimsoll lines are necessary for fresh and saltwater, and that the line is not solely a physical measurement but includes subjective evaluations of acceptable risk, further influenced by the ship's technical design.
despite these challenges, a practical line is drawn, offering significant advantages to seafarers over the years.
similarly, in economics, establishing a limit at any point holds greater significance than pinpointing the exact ideal location for the boundary.
with a global membership base of approximately 1,500, this organization operates in a participatory and inclusive manner, despite encountering challenges typical of such structures.
the growth of the organization can be attributed to the significance of its discussed ideas and raised concerns, as well as the remarkable drive and guidance provided by its president, robert costanza.
unlike the beijer institute for ecological economics, which forms part of the swedish royal academy of science under the direction of karl-goran maler and partha dasgupta, this organization has maintained a more critical stance towards mainstream economics.
the beijer institute, with a diverse and competent board of directors, is somewhat characterized by an establishment perspective, lacking strong grassroots participation.
while leaning towards a traditional environmental economics approach, the beijer institute does support a relatively open research agenda, concentrating on areas such as biodiversity, common property, and complex systems.
differences in willingness to pay are considered acceptable grounds for a competitive advantage, while variances in the level of internalized costs are not.
two important points should be addressed in this context.
firstly, there are significant differences in how costs are internalized, regardless of willingness to pay disparities.
secondly, even focusing solely on willingness to pay, a scenario may arise where one country's willingness to pay greatly differs from another's, justifying trade restrictions.
for instance, if country x shows little willingness to pay to eradicate extensive child labor (e.g., a 16-hour workday), country y is not obliged to impose similar conditions on its population or deal with the repercussions on its employment and community life resulting from free trade influenced by this low cost stance.
i recommend group training for various subjects, particularly for enhancing communication skills, even when the focus is on one-on-one dialogues.
one of the key advantages of group training is the opportunity for interaction and learning from diverse perspectives.
during role-playing activities, individuals can observe their colleagues' performance and behaviors, which can be insightful.
however, for more personal topics that individuals prefer not to discuss in a group setting, individual coaching is more suitable.
this is especially relevant for senior managers who may have confidential matters to address.
additionally, logistical challenges such as scheduling conflicts can make group training impractical if key participants are unavailable on the same date.
in this context, there is a specific emphasis on analyzing these secondary practices and dynamics and viewing them as essential components of specific global scales, even if they are not commonly acknowledged as such.
an obstacle in pinpointing these processes and participants within globalization is that they are frequently perceived and defined in national terms.
consequently, there is a requirement to unravel and understand elements conventionally categorized as national.
studying the global involves not just concentrating on explicitly global phenomena, but also examining locally specific practices and conditions that are interconnected with global forces.
it also involves understanding the increase in cross-border connections among different localities, which are driven by shared conditions across various regions.
moreover, it requires acknowledging that many global dynamics, like the global capital market, are partially rooted in sub-national locations and transition between different organizational frameworks and practices.
for instance, the global capital market is shaped by both global electronic markets and locally influential factors such as financial centers with their encompassing infrastructures and trust systems.
exploring processes and dynamics of globalization at sub-national levels involves utilizing methods and theories that address not only global but also sub-national scales, challenging traditional scale hierarchies.
analyzing global phenomena manifested at local levels offers benefits over examining globally scaled dynamics but also introduces specific complexities.
this approach enables the application of established research techniques, encompassing both quantitative and qualitative methods, in the examination of globalization.
it provides a platform for leveraging various national and sub-national datasets and specialized fields like area studies.
nonetheless, these studies must be embedded in conceptual frameworks different from those initially used by the researchers who developed these methodologies and datasets, as their focus was largely unrelated to globalization.
another important example linked to the first one pertains to the impact of new interactive technologies in reshaping the concept of the local, prompting a deep analysis of our understanding of it.
these latest technologies have the power to transform a financial services firm into a microenvironment with a global reach.
similarly, resource-constrained organizations or households can also transcend boundaries and establish themselves as global microenvironments, such as activist groups.
by connecting these microenvironments to distant ones, the conventional association of the local with physical proximity and contextual limitations becomes unsettled.
this reevaluation of the local concept involves challenging the traditional belief that local levels are inherently part of a hierarchical scale system from local to regional, national, and international, proposing a shift towards a more intricate understanding of spatial dynamics.
another example involves the interplay between global dynamics and specific aspects of national states.
central to this concept is the idea of the global being partially integrated within the national realm, with the global city serving as a prime illustration of this phenomenon.
the primary thesis posited is that when particular configurations of the global take root in what conventionally constitutes national territory, it fosters a range of bargaining processes.
a contemporary consequence of this dynamic is the emergence of what i term as a nascent, exceptionally specialized, and partial deconstruction of certain elements of national states.
apart from a growing interest in geography scholarship, the social sciences have generally overlooked critically analyzing the concept of national scale from a historical perspective.
this oversight has led to the tendency of viewing the national scale as fixed and thereby making it absolute, while overlooking the complexities involved in scaling or reducing it to a mere hierarchy of size.
additionally, there exists an unexamined assumption that different scales, particularly national and global, are mutually exclusive.
however, a nuanced perspective allowing for some level of interconnectedness between scales can be observed when scaling is perceived as a nested hierarchy, albeit in a very limited sense.
the current landscape of influence is evolving beyond the national level due to a combination of initiatives by leading corporations, advancements in technology linked to information and communications, and certain aspects of governmental actions.
notably, subnational entities like global cities and supranational entities such as global markets are now pivotal in strategic decision-making.
this shift has disrupted traditional power structures and economic models.
previously, power dynamics and economic frameworks were determined by the scale of institutions and territorial boundaries, ranging from international to national, regional, urban, and local, with the national level acting as the primary mediator.
a significant portion of societal structures and institutions is historically shaped at the national level, with elements like authority, identity, territory, security, legal systems, and economic growth being primarily defined and aligned at this scale.
if obtaining these rights, choices, and capabilities requires a partial surrender of aspects of state power as it has been developed in the past century, we can suggest that this paves the way for a shift in the role of the state.
this also indicates that national states must actively participate in the globalizing process.
ultimately, it signifies the emergence of new power dynamics that challenge traditional national state boundaries.
in closing this lecture, i aim to revisit the initial points related to methodology and interpretation.
throughout this lecture, my focus has been on instances of the global phenomenon that are situated within what are typically considered national institutional systems and operations.
these instances encompass various forms of global influence rooted in localized movements and individuals involved in transnational connections, extending to constructs like global cities, and even specific governmental initiatives designed to engage with global entities and their needs.
spanning across this diverse array of processes and sectors is a comprehensive research and theoretical agenda.
i have sought to delineate this agenda by amalgamating various threads of a swiftly expanding body of knowledge, in which geographers have played a significantly substantial role compared to other social scientists.
this agenda is steered by some key overarching concerns.
among oakland, california residents, those in the rockridge area were discovered to rely heavily on public transportation.
this neighborhood is recognized for its pedestrian-friendly environment, featuring narrow tree-lined streets and a commercial district bustling with small shops, cafes, and services, conveniently linked to a transit hub.
while there is a common belief that individuals residing in walkable areas are more inclined to walk, this research challenges that assumption regarding rockridge inhabitants.
surprisingly, the study found that even those who did not prioritize walkability in their neighborhood opted to walk as frequently as those who did.
we tested our new method on more than 1,000 species across various countries and sizes, evaluating its effectiveness and addressing potential challenges arising from existing data limitations.
our method offers significant advantages over current approaches.
it is adaptable to any geographical area, can be automated with access to databases, and can easily incorporate enhancements in future data.
additionally, it has relatively low data requirements, utilizing widely accessible biodiversity information such as distribution maps.
we are confident that our method can optimize resource allocation in conservation efforts by enabling efficient sharing of monitoring responsibilities, enhancing protected area networks, expanding biodiversity knowledge, and filling information gaps in various species groups.
the involvement of rem sleep in synaptic consolidation is a crucial aspect to consider.
while the active system consolidation hypothesis clarifies the temporary strengthening and integration of freshly acquired memories with existing long-term memories through reactivation, it falls short in elucidating how sleep after learning reinforces memory retention and solidifies synaptic connections in the long run.
therefore, it is presumed that sleep plays a role in synaptic consolidation to stabilize memories, with rem sleep potentially serving this purpose.
the heightened activation during this phase could enhance local synaptic plasticity without being influenced by external stimuli, unlike in wakefulness.
the focused and isolated synaptic consolidation during this period could be the reason why rem sleep by itself does not enhance declarative memory consolidation.
this is because declarative memory consolidation depends on integrating various features from different memories stored in multiple memory systems and facilitating information transfer across different brain regions, which occurs during slow-wave sleep (sws)-dependent system consolidation.
in my opinion, the functionalist critique overlooks the intricate interplay between agency and structure.
structural narratives characteristic of the modernist framework are not necessarily deterministic; rather, they emphasize the significance of structural transformations and how different political undertakings or beliefs can be facilitated or impeded by these structures.
politics inherently involves experimentation; certain policies may enhance the credibility of political institutions while others may falter.
the degree of success is influenced, to some extent, by the underlying structural conditions.
the merit of the modernist argument does not stem from a straightforward correlation between nationalism and industrialization or the emergence of the modern state.
for instance, the modernist perspective does not posit that nationalism developed solely to pave the way for industrialization or that nationalism inevitably emerges from industrialization.
nonetheless, i do assert that a fundamental element of industrialization, specifically print technology, plays a pivotal role in the ascent of nationalism.
connected to the feeling of insecurity is the confrontation with globalization and the sense of powerlessness that emerges when pivotal decisions impacting daily life are made increasingly distant.
the young men who tragically took their own lives on september 11 were all western-educated, a common trait among numerous nationalist and religious extremists.
for instance, seselj, the head of an extreme nationalist serb faction, had completed his ph.d. at the university of michigan.
many of the individuals who become radicalized are migrants, having moved either from rural to urban areas or from the global south to the west.
these individuals have grappled with severed connections to their homelands and struggle to feel integrated in their new environments.
i have supported the modernist viewpoint that nationalism is a concept that is created or imagined, and its effectiveness stems from its alignment with the structural aspects linked to modernity.
nationalism served as the cohesive force that facilitated the development of the modern state and industry.
furthermore, i have contended that the influence of nationalism is contingent on politics rather than culture, particularly in transparent democratic nations.
i interpret the fervor linked to nationalism not as a reflection of cultural prowess, but as a result of conflict and war playing a pivotal role in shaping nationalist sentiments.
the confucius computer represents a novel approach to computing that deviates from the traditional western logic found in computing systems and instead draws inspiration from eastern principles of equilibrium and unity.
its primary goal is to promote cross-generational cultural exchange by allowing individuals of all ages to engage with and delve into the rich cultural legacy of ancient asia.
through the utilization of modern media, the platform revitalizes and embodies these age-old philosophies and lessons, introducing them in contemporary settings like online social platforms, music, and culinary arts.
by leveraging digital interactivity, individuals are offered the opportunity to immerse themselves in and appreciate antiquity in a new and engaging way.
confucianism, an ancient eastern ethical and philosophical system that has profoundly impacted asian countries for over 2500 years, is now garnering increasing interest in western societies.
however, the complexity of confucian philosophies poses a challenge for many due to cultural and language barriers.
traditional passive media offer only a surface-level understanding of his teachings, hindering the learning process.
moreover, modern youth gravitate towards digital and networked media.
to bridge the gap, our goal is to create an interactive and dynamic way for users to explore confucianism and eastern culture through computing technology.
the confucius computer aims to provide a personalized experience, allowing users to delve deep into the richness of this ancient culture.
this research obtained and correlated vaccination records with cases of viral meningitis diagnosed in children in their second year of life between october 1988 and december 1991.
the observation period for each child represents the timeframe during which any potential event would be recorded.
therefore, the study's observation period spans from 366 to 730 days of age, covering the period from october 1, 1988, to december 31, 1991, inclusive.
accurate precision regarding ages and timelines is crucial in this context.
after considering data from previous research and understanding the replication timeline of the mumps virus, we have determined the risk window to be from day 15 through day 35 after receiving the mmr vaccine.
by analyzing the vaccination records, we have documented the exposure histories of all cases within the observation period.
it is essential to have vaccination records for ages 331 to 715 days to categorize each day during the observation period as either exposed or unexposed.
two prominent characteristics are apparent in a basic model of corporate finance involving overly optimistic managers and efficient capital markets.
firstly, these optimistic managers have the belief that the market undervalues the risky securities of their firm and might reject profitable projects requiring external financing.
secondly, these managers tend to overestimate the value of their corporate projects and could be inclined to invest in projects with negative net present value, even when they prioritize shareholders' interests.
these findings illustrate a trade-off between underinvestment and overinvestment linked to free cash flow, without the need to consider asymmetric information or rational agency costs.
conversely, managerial optimism leads to consistently inflated cash flow projections and results in managers overestimating the value of the company's investment prospects.
managers who lack free cash flow may be reluctant to pursue projects with a negative net present value that they believe to be positive because they view the cost of external financing as prohibitive.
in such cases, free cash flow can be detrimental.
it eliminates the requirement for external financing and facilitates the pursuit of projects with negative net present value that are erroneously perceived as positive.
it is crucial to understand that optimistic managers will only make a limited number of poor decisions.
if the investment cost i surpasses the high cash flow state rh, optimistic managers will not pursue the project.
essentially, there exist projects of such low quality that not even highly optimistic managers will proceed with them, as their positive outlook on the likelihood of success cannot compensate for the fact that the project's returns will not sufficiently offset the initial investment.
nonetheless, optimistic managers may still consider a wide range of projects with negative net present value.
domestic violence criminalization involves implementing laws to address domestic violence through both criminal and civil legal measures.
this article examines social science, legal, and criminal justice studies on strategies employed to combat domestic violence.
it delves into the theoretical underpinnings, evaluates the efficacy of police involvement, and discusses the application of protective orders.
additionally, it scrutinizes prosecution and support for victims, court reactions, mandated batterers' programs, and collaborative community actions against domestic violence.
the implications for social work practice are discussed, along with essential guidance for helping individuals who have suffered violence within their homes.
police officers should bear significant responsibilities, including aiding in the issuance of temporary protection orders and providing information on local domestic violence shelters and their contact details.
moreover, they should conduct post-case follow-up calls once the court proceedings are concluded.
it is crucial for police officers to stay informed about domestic violence offenders on probation to cooperate effectively with the probation department.
establishing specialized domestic violence units within police departments, akin to existing child abuse units, could greatly enhance support for victims seeking legal redress against their abusers.
in the realm of particle physics, it is noteworthy that a theory as triumphant as quantum electrodynamics is not directly applicable when transitioning from atomic to nuclear energy scales.
at nuclear energy levels, the dominant force is the strong interaction superseding electromagnetism.
the transition from atomic to nuclear scales represents a mere separation of 6 orders of magnitude.
pediatric visits at the primary care clinic encompassed walk-in services, sick visits, and scheduled routine health check-ups.
study participants also attended initial and follow-up appointments at the outpatient clinics dedicated to lead exposure and failure-to-thrive.
patient care was consistently provided by both pediatricians and pediatric nurse practitioners, with no changes made due to the study, apart from the inclusion of a research assistant and tape recorder.
the individuals involved - patients, families, medical staff, and interpreters - were informed that the study focused on patient-physician communication without disclosing that medical interpretation errors would be examined.
at times, the complexity of medical terminology, idiomatic expressions, and contextual nuances may lead medical interpreters to deviate from a strict word-for-word translation.
in such cases, any variations from literal interpretation due to jargon, idioms, or context were not considered errors on the part of the interpreter.
additionally, as medical interpreters may also serve in roles such as cultural mediators or advocates, any instances where they provided cultural context or advocated for the patient or family were not deemed interpreter errors.
a distinct analysis focusing on the correlation between the number of verbal exchanges, the parties involved, and the quality of interpretation will be presented in a separate paper.
while the spotlight has been on medical errors following a notable institute of medicine report, errors in medical interpretation have not been a prominent part of this dialogue.
this research identifies parallels between common mechanisms for medical errors and interpreter errors with clinical implications, such as incorrect dosages, frequencies, durations, or modes of drug administration.
it also highlights instances of crucial clinical information being overlooked, like drug allergies and past medical histories.
these findings underscore the significance of utilizing proficient, well-trained medical interpreters for limited english proficiency (lep) patients to diminish errors and enhance healthcare quality.
to continually enhance quality assurance, healthcare facilities could consider periodically recording a sample of clinical interactions involving medical interpreters to detect and track interpreter errors in general, the occurrence of clinically relevant interpreter errors, and the subsequent medical errors stemming from interpreter mistakes.
the discussion in this article suggests that the standardization of global curriculum, teaching methods, and assessment procedures could stem from prevailing international trends.
concepts such as the knowledge economy, ongoing education, and the development of human capital are shaping the perspectives of government officials worldwide.
various studies indicate strong endorsement from key international organizations like the world bank and oecd towards educational strategies aligned with the knowledge economy and human capital enhancement.
promoting gender equality in education is a top priority for many global agencies.
the establishment of a consistent global curriculum is additionally supported through cross-country performance comparisons from assessments like timss and pisa.
the emergence of neoliberal ideologies and frameworks like the general agreement on trade in services (gats) are driving a worldwide push for the privatization of educational services, notably in higher education, as well as the dissemination of educational materials and services by multinational corporations.
brain circulation also plays a role in shaping global educational norms, influenced by local demands to prepare graduates for the international job market.
with english prevailing as the language of global commerce, the incorporation of english language instruction is becoming a common feature in national educational frameworks.
non-governmental organizations, especially those focused on human rights and environmental advocacy, are championing progressive human rights and environmental education initiatives.
in a stark departure from prevailing worldwide patterns, indigenous communities are advocating for the preservation of traditional educational methods.
additionally, there is apprehension among some groups regarding the erosion of local cultures and identities as english gains prominence as a global language.
these tensions underscore the significance of global educational standards while also hinting at potential shifts in their ongoing evolution.
these observations aid in clarifying the concept of logical necessity.
despite the prevailing view held by many philosophers for an extended period, there is no requirement to actually draw out logical conclusions.
even if g follows logically from f, it is not mandatory to think of g immediately upon considering f.
however, what is essential is that if f is true, then g must also be true.
bringing about f inevitably results in bringing about g.
therefore, it is acceptable in reasoning that preserves truth to progress from f to g.
decisions related to policies and programs involve selecting from various options for preparing teachers.
the choices in this matter have sparked intense debates due to the critical shortage of teachers currently faced.
despite this urgency, research on special education teacher training is notably lacking.
however, comparative studies that outline the key features of successful teacher training programs can guide these decisions if based on insights from previous research on general teacher education.
our aim is to support educators by examining literature from both general and special teacher education.
initially, we propose a framework, inspired by general education studies, to evaluate teacher training programs.
we then apply this framework to review practices in special education teacher preparation.
a comprehensive analysis of special education program descriptions and assessments was conducted.
finally, we outline the essential steps needed to enhance the research foundation for special education teacher training.
our evaluation comparing special education teacher training programs to outstanding general education programs indicates that certain elements likely impact the effectiveness of novice special education teachers.
specifically, immersive field experiences tailored to help prospective teachers synthesize classroom learning may lead to superior knowledge and skill development compared to programs lacking this integration.
moreover, programs that encourage extensive collaboration between faculty and students, emphasizing teaching strategies and expertise in handling diverse student populations, are likely to yield better results for aspiring special educators.
nonetheless, it is crucial to establish evidence-based connections between teacher training components and the outcomes for both novice teachers and students, in order to validate the impact of special education teacher education.
further research is imperative to investigate the influence of osep funding on teacher training.
currently, there is insufficient understanding regarding how osep-funded initiatives contribute to the proficiency and longevity of special education teachers.
critical aspects to explore include the sustainability of osep-funded programs, the institutional variables influencing their continuity, and whether these initiatives incorporate successful teacher education strategies.
given the substantial federal funding directed towards special education teacher preparation, it is crucial to gain comprehensive insights into the outcomes of this investment.
when utilizing relationship mining, it is crucial for identified relationships to meet two key criteria: statistical significance and interestingness.
statistical significance is usually evaluated through conventional statistical assessments like f-tests.
due to the execution of numerous tests, it becomes essential to mitigate the possibility of chance findings.
one approach to achieving this is by applying post-hoc statistical techniques or adjustments that consider the number of tests conducted, such as the bonferroni adjustment.
this technique enhances the certainty that a specific identified relationship is not merely coincidental.
another strategy involves evaluating the overall likelihood of the observed results pattern through monte carlo methods.
this methodology examines the probability of the overall results pattern occurring by chance, providing a comprehensive assessment of the findings' validity.
this paper discusses the influential role of archival institutions, arguing that they hold significant power.
as stated by rose, establishments like galleries and museums shape specific forms of knowledge and, consequently, shape the type of visitors they attract.
these institutions have the authority to decide which artworks are displayed and which remain in storage.
they also control the layout of public spaces by placing seating strategically and allowing some items to be touched while others are kept secure.
operating on a similar basis, archival institutions wield their power by producing catalogs and regulating researchers' access to certain materials.
the execution of this authority over visitors and researchers within these institutions lies with their guardians.
upon gaining access to various archival institutions, i experienced immense pressure as time constraints allowed only a few hours to sift through documents before new data arrived the following day.
it was frustrating not being able to adjust my requests based on findings from previous searches, and having to wait an additional two to three working days for specific boxes.
the vast array of boxes without detailed descriptions left me feeling overwhelmed and led to sporadic choices.
while negotiating access to sealed boxes in one institution was a privilege, it paradoxically added to the challenges of the process.
in most cases, the disorderly arrangement of documents and the absence of crucial pages proved to be disheartening.
due to the time constraints and restrictions set by the guardians overseeing the archival documents, i opted to utilize a camera to capture numerous pages of data, even if they appeared loosely connected to my research.
my intention was to conduct a thorough analysis of the material at a later stage.
this was a research methodology i had not previously explored, as i had planned to review the documents meticulously before considering copying or photographing them and to select data based on well-defined contents listed in the archival boxes.
however, given the aforementioned circumstances and constraints, i made the decision to gather and compile databases of data that held potential relevance to my study.
my strategy involved initially amassing the data in a raw format, prioritizing quantity over quality.
after a few days of employing this method, despite my initial hesitance, i began to acknowledge its potential benefits.
i discovered that the archive has undergone multiple relocations and changes in storage locations over the years, resulting in the loss of historic documents and materials during the moves or due to improper storage and handling.
the new site of the archive is situated in a residential suburb, housed in a former kindergarten building, which is not ideal for the storage and research of data.
the archive has limited opening hours, allowing researchers only three hours a day for study, and it is closed on fridays.
it wasn't just the guardian's authority, but the entire archive system, including its regulations and procedures, that determined the timing and method of my data retrieval.
derrida labels these institutional processes as the "science of the archives." in this scenario, the archive explicitly stated: "you must be patient." after a week of waiting, i was informed via email by the guardian that the archive had no relevant information for my research.
encouraged by advice from guardians at other archives who suggested that valuable data might be found there, i was determined not to abandon my search.
i made a call to the archive, requesting a meeting with a senior guardian to navigate the bureaucratic obstacles.
after numerous discussions, i finally spoke to a guardian who questioned my interest in that specific timeframe.
reluctant to share a list of archives, i started questioning the existence of such a catalog or whether access to it was restricted.
further inquiries eventually led to a breakthrough: the guardian discovered some kindergarten records that were accessible to me.
primarily examine evidence-based medicine (ebm) through the lens of an individual medical practitioner who must make treatment decisions for a patient with specific symptoms.
in contrast, when considering evidence-based software engineering (ebse), our perspective differs as individual developers within organizations typically do not have the autonomy to select technologies.
technology choices are often dictated by project managers or senior management at the project, departmental, or organizational levels.
additionally, in the realm of software engineering, the focus is not solely on the technology's application to a specific task, but rather on the overall project outcome in which the task plays a role.
research conducted in evidence-based management emphasizes the significance of formulating research questions that are sufficiently broad to accommodate variations in the study factor and diverse populations.
in evidence-based software engineering, the study factor typically revolves around a specific technology.
it is crucial not to narrow down the technology at too abstract a level, such as design methods or software lifecycles, but rather to define it broadly enough to encompass the majority of pertinent empirical studies, such as object-oriented methods, agile methods, or cost estimation methods.
in certain cases, a more precise identification of the technology may be required, like contract-based specifications, pair-programming, or statistically-derived estimation models.
defining the target population can be even more challenging.
the population of interest can be classified along various dimensions, like the experience of technology users, the types of problems the technology addresses, or the application area.
nonetheless, overly broad categories might hinder the extraction of valuable empirical evidence if adhering strictly to such categorization.
while an equivalent to the cochrane collaboration may not exist, there are numerous abstracting services available for articles.
various organizations like the ieee and the acm offer databases such as ieee xplore and the acm digital library.
these databases index articles by author names and keywords, often including links to abstracts and, occasionally, access to the full articles.
this indexing system facilitates information retrieval for researching specific problem areas or answering particular questions.
the ongoing dispute between berry and tichy and sobel and clarkson regarding the procedures for conducting recent experiments on formal methods highlights the absence of widely accepted guidelines and standard protocols in empirical software engineering.
to address this gap, kitchenham et al.
have put forward initial guidelines for formal experiments and surveys.
however, these guidelines do not cover observational and investigatory studies.
additionally, due to their attempt to encompass various types of empirical studies, the guidelines lack the specificity and detail provided in the consort statement.
nevertheless, feedback is prevalent in the field of medicine at a more comprehensive scale.
specifically, physicians have the duty to share any unexpected side effects of medications.
this supports the body of knowledge linked to a specific treatment and might pave the way for additional fundamental research.
transposing this model into software engineering could be advantageous.
however, within a competitive sector, there is minimal motivation for companies to aid their rivals by disclosing positive and negative encounters.
furthermore, distinguishing fresh experiences with a technology from the unique context of their implementation can prove challenging.
for instance, a design approach relies on an initial requirements analysis.
it needs to take into account limitations set by the software and hardware platform, programming schedules, and budget constraints.
it should be integrated with suitable coding and testing methods.
as a result, validating the substantial influence of a design technique on the ultimate reliability of a product could be challenging.
overall, establishing a definitive cause-and-effect relationship between a specific technique and the desired project result becomes complex when the use of the technique and the final result occur at different times.
additionally, various other tasks and activities could also impact the final result.
an alternative method involves compiling datasets containing project information, sourced from either a single company or multiple companies, to create quality or productivity benchmarks.
the idea is to utilize these datasets to evaluate how software engineering technologies influence quality and productivity.
however, a significant challenge with this strategy lies in procuring a reliable sample of projects.
to ensure valid findings, projects should represent a random sample from a specific population.
nonetheless, defining the population and obtaining a truly random sample pose difficulties when it comes to software projects.
nonetheless, certain scientific challenges prove to be more formidable.
the evaluation of technologies dependent on human expertise presents a persistent issue, as our studies remain susceptible to bias from both subjects and experimenters.
while there are methods to mitigate this concern, grappling with the intricate nature of the software development cycle poses a greater hurdle.
gaining dependable insights into the performance of technologies within extensive projects will continue to be a formidable task.
case 2: a 75-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure, knee osteoarthritis, and hypertension underwent elective knee replacement surgery.
despite being an active volunteer, he had been experiencing limitations due to knee pain and fatigue.
the knee replacement procedure went smoothly without any complications.
however, on the first day after surgery, he developed delirium after taking low-dose pain medication, leading to a fall while attempting to stand.
this incident resulted in incontinence and reluctance to engage in physical therapy.
by the fifth postoperative day, he was transferred to a subacute rehabilitation facility where his delirium gradually resolved.
he had to stay in the facility for a full two weeks and engage in outpatient rehabilitation for a month to regain his mobility and independence.
recent advancements in telomere biology have shed light on its potential significance in unraveling the mechanisms underlying the onset of frailty.
telomeres, comprising repetitive dna sequences and specialized proteins, play a crucial role in safeguarding the ends of linear chromosomes.
with aging and successive rounds of cellular division, these protective structures diminish in length, setting off a cascade of events including cellular dna damage, leading ultimately to programmed cell death, cellular senescence, or genetic instability, culminating in the production of faulty proteins.
early studies have suggested a link between shorter telomeres in older individuals and a higher risk of premature death, emphasizing the importance of telomere length in longevity.
while the precise pathways linking shortened telomeres to early mortality remain unclear, investigating the molecular and tissue changes resulting from telomere shortening may offer valuable insights into the biology of frailty.
research suggests that various interventions have the potential to modify aspects of frailty, making them suitable candidates for targeted future clinical trials.
among these interventions, exercise, particularly strength training, stands out as the most effective in enhancing components of frailty such as muscle strength and physical function.
it is proposed that older individuals might need to increase protein intake beyond the current recommended levels, potentially in conjunction with exercise, to maintain and build skeletal mass.
while a combination of strength training and protein supplementation has shown promise in enhancing strength and muscle mass in very elderly sedentary nursing home residents, it is emphasized that only exercise alone seems to enhance strength and functionality; nutritional supplementation alone has not proven to be effective.
alongside exercise strategies, tailored preventive rehabilitation interventions involving structured physical therapy have demonstrated success in reducing functional decline among frail older adults.
there is a suggestion that further refinement and integration of such multifaceted approaches could contribute to enhancing the function and quality of life among frail older individuals.
nevertheless, it is essential for all studies in software engineering to aim for a high level of external validity given the vast and intricate nature of the software world, which makes comprehensive study impractical.
researchers must carefully select typical projects to analyze and subsequently extrapolate and apply their findings broadly.
throughout history, numerous religious groups have delved into defining the core virtues and obligations of healthcare providers and have expressed their unique perspectives on medical ethics.
the roman catholic church is not the sole christian denomination with established viewpoints on various medical ethics dilemmas.
protestant churches also hold distinct stances.
moreover, non-christian faiths offer profound insights.
for instance, jewish and islamic medical ethics outline the roles and accountabilities of practitioners from these religions.
in regions like east asia and the indian subcontinent, medical ethics traditions are deeply influenced by taoism, confucianism, buddhism, shintoism, and hinduism.
moral philosophers started delving into practical ethical dilemmas such as abortion, euthanasia, the ethics of war, capital punishment, allocation of limited medical resources, animal rights, and similar issues.
they bravely challenged previously unexamined aspects.
their focus on topics associated with healthcare and biological sciences played a crucial role in paving the way for bioethics as an essential field of study.
in such instances, international agreements stipulate that the responsibility for the aforementioned materials belongs to the countries where they originate from.
thus, negotiations concerning benefits must occur between the interested commercial entity seeking to utilize the biological resources and the specific country of origin.
it could be contended that this arrangement could offer a model for ensuring equitable benefit sharing of traditional knowledge as well.
this is because knowledge lacking the associated biological resources would be futile.
additionally, it would address concerns about fair resource distribution and beneficiary identification, as the government, acting as the legitimate representative of its populace, could undertake this responsibility and be accountable for it.
however, a limitation of this approach is its assumption that these nations possess legitimate governments with valid claims to speak on behalf of their people, a presumption that may not always hold true.
humanitarians would potentially support medical tourism if it results in a net increase of quality-adjusted or disability-adjusted life-years.
however, they would not condone tying access to essential medicines in a poor nation to its capacity to generate income from medical tourism.
advocates of the political approach would probably evaluate the agreements made between wealthy and developing countries to safeguard the rights and well-being of residents in developing nations from potential unfair treatment or harm resulting from service contracts related to medical tourism.
the current application of reproductive technologies places a strong emphasis on individual autonomy and freedom, setting it apart from historical eugenics practices by prioritizing personal choice.
a similar focus on personal agency can be observed in debates surrounding biomedical advancements aimed at prolonging human life.
these developments contradict the notion that bioethics is inherently totalitarian, as foucault suggests that state intervention may not always be essential for the effectiveness of biopolitical strategies.
security games are a distinctive category of games that examine the dynamics between nefarious attackers and defenders.
these games, along with their solutions, serve as a framework for structured decision-making, algorithm creation, and anticipating attacker strategies.
the complexity of security games can range from straightforward deterministic scenarios to intricate stochastic and restricted information models, depending on factors like available information to decision-makers (dms), action spaces, and dms' objectives.
they have utility across a spectrum of security issues, such as intrusion detection, privacy, and cryptography in wireless, vehicular, and computer networks.
although gamification is increasingly being utilized in various sectors like business, marketing, corporate management, health insurance, ecology, and wellness programs, its use in education is a developing trend.
this article delves into an analysis of existing empirical studies concerning the implementation of gamification in educational settings.
the scope of the study is focused on scholarly papers that specifically examine the impacts of incorporating gaming elements within distinct educational environments.
employing a methodical mapping approach, the study proposes a structured categorization of research findings based on the prevalent themes observed in the literature.
these categories encompass foundational principles of gamification design, game mechanics, contextual factors relevant to gamification implementation such as academic subject and level, as well as aspects of execution and assessment.
through a comprehensive mapping of the research findings against these predefined criteria, the study sheds light on the current trends in empirical research on gamification in education.
furthermore, it identifies key challenges and requirements, such as the necessity for robust technological infrastructure and the demand for well-controlled studies validating the efficacy of specific game elements in diverse educational scenarios.
the prevalent gamification design principles frequently applied in educational settings include visual status, social engagement, freedom of choice, freedom to fail, and rapid feedback.
conversely, there is a scarcity of literature discussing the principles of goals and personalization.
this scarcity can be attributed to the fact that goals and personalization are regarded as foundational elements in instructional and educational applications, having long been the focus of pedagogical and educational computing research.
therefore, advancements specifically linked to these aspects may not be necessarily attributed to the gamification of education.
application type is a critical criterion concerning the setting in which gamification is implemented.
the research papers were categorized based on the context in which gamification was employed, including gamifying courses without online support, moocs or online courses, blended learning courses, e-learning sites, and the development of gamification support platforms.
the distribution of papers among these categories is illustrated in figure 4.
it is evident that the predominant focus of the reported case studies lies in the gamification of blended learning courses.
the study highlighted that although there are numerous publications focusing on the application of gamification in education, many simply outline various game mechanics and dynamics without delving into empirical research on how integrating game elements impacts learning environments.
furthermore, most empirical studies lack thorough evaluations, hindering the ability to perform a comprehensive meta-analysis to draw conclusions on the overall effectiveness or drawbacks.
while some trends in utilizing specific combinations of game mechanics and gamification design principles were identified in the mapping study, their actual impact within educational settings is yet to be substantiated through practical demonstration.
while comprehensive evaluation is lacking, most authors of the papers under review agree that when well-designed and utilized appropriately, gamification holds promise for enhancing learning.
hence, there is a requirement for more robust empirical studies to examine the motivational impacts of individual game elements within distinct educational settings and for various learner profiles.
such research would serve to guide educators looking to incorporate gamification into their curriculum by offering insights into selecting suitable game components for their unique circumstances.
the growing interest in studying borders, focusing on how differences are constructed and represented, emerged from the postmodern shift in social sciences.
this discourse suggests that borders are constructed through our knowledge and interpretations, shaping the way we perceive the world.
consequently, the distinction between the ontology of borders (what borders are) and the epistemology of borders (how we understand and know borders) has blurred or vanished.
recognizing that borders are influenced by our social practices and cultural environment has expanded border studies beyond traditional state or national boundaries.
drawing upon the principles of postmodernism, significant attention has been directed towards the representation and symbolism of borders through both form and narrative.
this focus has given rise to a standardized approach to constructing borders, influenced heavily by the theories of post-structuralist thinkers such as foucault, derrida, bourdieu, and de certeau.
this method, referred to as a "bordering script," serves as a fundamental framework for analyzing the social construction of specific borders within various contexts.
while each study that adopts this framework offers valuable insights into the construction of borders or explores alternative perspectives, the ongoing discourse may be somewhat imbalanced.
this imbalance could be likened to debates from the early twentieth century, suggesting parallels in the current scholarly discussions.
one more reason why i find it unfortunate that the current debate does not address the nature of borders is the absence of a discussion on the ethics and justice of socio-spatial borders, distinguishing between good and bad borders.
adapting this discussion to contemporary knowledge is essential, especially considering the timely question of the morality of borders.
it is crucial to consider whether borders are morally justified and, if so, to what extent it is ethically acceptable to prioritize self-protection over granting access to others.
should there be a moral distinction between citizens and foreigners?
therefore, rather than focusing on the physical demarcation itself, i am interested in exploring the moral implications of borders and avoiding justifications based on essentialist beliefs about the natural or militarized delineations in space.
reciprocal determinism, a central construct of social cognitive theory (sct), delineates how a person can function as both an instigator and a reactor to change.
it posits that modifications in one's surroundings, exposure to influential role models, and the reinforcement mechanisms can all play a pivotal role in fostering healthier behavioral patterns.
this fundamental principle not only underpins social ecological models but is also increasingly critical in the context of contemporary societal challenges.
important individuals who make decisions within a community frequently operate under constraints of time, particularly when their planning relies on financial resources.
given that significant changes in social norms and a community's physical settings may require years to become evident, adopting ecological models that acknowledge a lengthy and sometimes gradual sequence of events is crucial for designing effective programs and for enlightening decision makers about the importance of being patient and maintaining support over time.
this strategy should be complemented by consistent, collective endeavors to bring about alterations in policies, systems, and the environment.
the current empirical research on factors influencing pollution is facing various challenges.
firstly, there is a lack of consensus among scholars regarding which variables are truly influential in explaining environmental contamination.
secondly, many researchers fail to conduct thorough sensitivity analyses on their empirical results, leaving uncertainty about the robustness of identified pollution determinants when additional relevant variables are considered.
thirdly, most studies tend to concentrate on a single hypothesis with limited control variables, rather than systematically exploring multiple hypotheses from the literature.
this approach overlooks potential relationships with other variables and the risk of omitted variable bias.
lastly, some studies suffer from restricted data samples, often focusing on a single country over multiple years or a single year across various countries.
the results from the eba analysis of the baseline model provide strong support for the environmental kuznets curve (ekc) hypothesis, particularly concerning water pollution.
the negative coefficient of squared gdp per capita indicates the presence of a non-linear association between per capita gdp and both pollution variables.
to confirm the existence of an inverted u-shaped relationship, it is essential to determine if the projected turning point falls within the sample range.
hence, for both models, we compute the estimated ekc-turning point for each of the 1,159 regressions.
this approach allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of the ekc-turning point compared to the standard practice in this field of research.
recent attention towards politically driven factors influencing environmental conditions may not hold significant promise.
the analysis indicates that only the presence of a dictatorship significantly correlates with co2 emissions, showing that dictatorships are linked with lower air pollution levels per person.
moreover, it suggests that economic freedom may lead to higher levels of water pollution.
nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that the simplistic nature of our model limitations does not negate potential indirect pathways through which political variables impact pollution levels.
acknowledging the significance of our approach, it is crucial to acknowledge certain limitations.
our primary objective was to conduct an empirical evaluation of previously proposed variables.
while emphasizing reduced form estimations offers the advantage of yielding easily obtainable, straightforward results, it also runs the risk of overlooking indirect transmission channels or failing to model underlying dynamics in a more sophisticated manner.
therefore, future research in this area should reassess and perhaps integrate some of the theoretical models that informed the inclusion of the robust variables we have identified.
moreover, our findings can serve as a foundation for constructing and analyzing more structurally oriented models capable of capturing potential indirect effects and addressing underlying dynamics.
hence, although we view our work as a significant advancement, there remains a considerable scope for further exploration in this research domain.
questions exist surrounding sociopolitical matters regarding the perception of disciplinary knowledge by stakeholders within the context of human affairs.
who has developed the theories and where?
how has the evolution of theory transpired in the realms of history and sociology?
is there consensus among scholars in the field concerning existing theories or are there significant divergences in opinion?
furthermore, how is this knowledge implemented, and is it anticipated to offer practical usefulness and relevance?
are there discernible social, ethical, or political implications linked to the utilization of this disciplinary knowledge?
topics addressed in the discussion encompass the general concept of theory, the importance of generalization, the understanding of causality, and the fundamental objectives of explanation and prediction.
attempting to summarize the extensive discourse spanning centuries on these subjects into a single paper proves challenging.
therefore, the chosen approach is to provide a broad overview of the various viewpoints explored, emphasizing distinct ideological discrepancies associated with divergent theoretical approaches, while also acknowledging significant shared principles.
certain theories may prioritize either explanation or prediction, possibly neglecting the other.
for instance, achieving accurate predictions does not always require a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
as an illustration, one can forecast rain based on cloud formations without comprehending the intricacies of precipitation.
similarly, some models excel at elucidating processes but may lack precision in predictions.
for example, insights from case studies on information systems implementation can reveal how user neglect leads to dissatisfaction with the system.
however, accurately anticipating the exact extent of user dissatisfaction across various systems and contexts remains challenging.
dubin terms these dilemmas as the precision paradox and the power paradox, respectively.
other approaches could involve empirical classification methods, such as examining the evolution of theory types in is publications over time to identify groupings based on observed characteristics, possibly using statistical tools like cluster analysis.
an analytical approach is chosen here for its suitability in extracting key attributes of theory from extensive literature sources.
the paragraph provides an in-depth examination of different types of theories, elucidated with relevant examples.
each theory type showcases variations based on the specific focus and extent of the theory's application.
examples pertaining to each theory type are scrutinized to detect seven key components of a theory: means of representation, constructs, relationships, scope, causal explanations, falsifiable statements, and prescriptive statements.
evaluating existing theories can be intricate since they may not explicitly encompass all seven components, leading to the application of some interpretive flexibility in presenting examples.
furthermore, the classification process hinges on the primary objectives of the theory rather than tangential goals.
for instance, a theory primarily emphasizing prediction but containing simplistic explanatory elements would be categorized as type iii.
this category of theory focuses on the explanation of how and why certain phenomena happen.
while these theories are structured to provide insights into the occurrence of events, they are not primarily concerned with generating testable predictions for the future.
they offer explanations on the how, when, where, and why events unfold, leading to the development of process-oriented theories.
this group could aptly be termed "theory for understanding" as it often aims to demonstrate alternative perspectives on how the world can be perceived, ultimately fostering a different comprehension of realities and reasons behind them.
it is important to acknowledge the limitations of this type of theory.
discovering regularities or connections between two variables does not automatically suggest a cause-and-effect relationship.
for instance, while there is a correlation between height and weight, one does not directly cause the other.
similarly, the amount of ice cream sold at beaches shows a strong positive correlation with the frequency of shark attacks.
however, it would be incorrect to infer that eating ice cream triggers shark attacks.
in both scenarios, another variable, which influences both factors, is more relevant.
in this case, temperature emerges as the crucial variable, as higher temperatures result in increased beach attendance and more people in the water, thus increasing the risk of shark attacks.
a taxonomy was employed to categorize 50 research articles from two prominent journals as a demonstration of its practicality.
the articles selected were from the period between march 2003 and june 2004 from mis quarterly and information systems research.
all articles were included in the classification process except issues and opinions, review articles, and research essays.
the classification was carried out independently by the author and a junior researcher, with table 2's distinguishing attributes serving as the primary criteria for assigning articles to types i to v.
out of the 50 articles analyzed, 45 were classified identically by both researchers in the initial assessment, while five required further discussion for classification.
the outcomes of this classification process are presented in the appendix.
the findings of the activity demonstrated that the schema seemed comprehensive as no papers were identified that did not fit within the schema.
the decision rules for assigning theory to a category were deemed clear, as the junior researcher successfully applied them independently and reached conclusions consistent with the author.
an inquiry arose regarding the necessity of the type iii category.
only one article was discovered with theory falling under category iii, which pertained to prediction without causal explanation.
it is suggested that this category be maintained for analytical completeness and because it represents a recognized type of theory by several authors, despite being infrequently utilized.
table 9 exhibits the relative frequency of each theory type.
this essay discussed various concepts regarding theory in information systems (is) and proposed a classification system for organizing the theories that are formulated.
while many of the ideas presented in the discussion are not novel and have been drawn from existing literature, the unique compilation and arrangement of these concepts result in a taxonomy that deviates significantly in focus from the typical discourse in is research.
the primary goal of the essay is to provoke thought and encourage discourse on the essence of theory as a subject worthy of dedicated consideration.
in pursuit of this objective, the narrative is structured around thought-provoking questions that stimulate debate, incorporating some personal viewpoints and value judgments along the way.
it would be inaccurate to assume that all individuals developing type iii theories are logical positivists, or that those working on type ii theories are interpretivists, or that interpretivists exclusively construct type ii theories.
type iii or type iv theories, commonly recognized as natural-science type theories, involve testable theories.
in the field of information systems (is), researchers identifying as positivists often conduct research incorporating such testable theories.
nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that not only self-declared positivists create type iii and iv theories.
it is crucial to avoid attaching paradigmatic labels to these theory types as no strict correlation exists between a specific theory type and any single paradigm.
in line with the natural sciences model, types iii and iv theories align with widely held views of scientific-type theories by offering testable propositions.
consequently, they have been well-received within the field of is.
nevertheless, the terms "scientific" and "science" carry varying interpretations across contexts, making it imprudent to firmly associate them exclusively with specific theory types or to leverage them in promoting the legitimacy of one theory type over another.
one benefit of categorizing different forms of theory development under labels is that it compels theorists to precisely consider the kind of knowledge they seek and the characteristics of statements permissible within each theory category.
this approach also encourages viewing individual contributions to theory as cooperative and cohesive advancements within theory construction.
recognizing that each theory type possesses different strengths can lead to a more robust and comprehensive theory.
by treating our endeavors in constructing one theory type as components of a broader framework and recognizing potential linkages among the subdivisions, a more comprehensive and interconnected theory can be achieved.
many definitions of theory mention goal-related characteristics to varying degrees, making it an ideal starting point for creating a taxonomy.
another potential distinguishing factor among theories is the level of generality, although it is considered less important than the goal.
however, it could be utilized in a two-dimensional classification scheme.
subsequent subclassifications within these types may also be explored.
the taxonomy primarily utilizes structural attributes as the main classifier, rather than socio-technical or epistemological differences.
employing attributes of different types on the same level in a classification schema may pose challenges.
if a classification based on non-structural grounds is pursued, it should be done separately.
another significant aspect of the essay is its advocacy for legitimizing each of the five classes of theory.
the essay highlights the considerable variation in perspectives regarding the definition of theory, which may not be fully understood by journal editors, reviewers, and authors.
it emphasizes the importance of acknowledging the differing views on process-type and variance-type theories, as well as the potential for type iv theory to encompass aspects of both process and variance.
the essay suggests that researchers can leverage the arguments presented to validate the significance of their own theories.
in conclusion, this essay delves into the untouched topic of the structural nature of is theory, shedding light on a neglected aspect within is research when compared to discussions on disciplinary boundaries, epistemological methodologies, and sociopolitical concerns.
by potentially sparking increased interest in this facet of our research pursuits, the essay holds value.
it calls for a direct challenge to the enduring influences of logical positivism that have led to the exclusion of causal logic in theoretical assertions, emphasizing the significance of precision in our language when proposing theories.
specifically, it underscores the importance of discerning between generality and predictive capabilities, delineating a theory's scope, and carefully framing propositions.
the study of dialogue is acknowledged as a forthcoming challenge in psycholinguistics.
nevertheless, we believe that exploring monologue and reading scenarios also presents its own set of obstacles that necessitate significant attention.
many non-specialist academics intrigued by language use often perceive psycholinguistics as utilizing brief, uninteresting, out-of-context materials in experiments.
as researchers in this field, we feel compelled to counter any negative interpretations by emphasizing the need for precise control over sentence structure and content to grasp fundamental comprehension mechanisms fully.
for example, an essential focus lies in establishing the syntactic and semantic analyses of specific sentence structures.
although this perspective presents an intriguing approach to addressing some essential issues of in-depth interpretation, it also establishes a connection between reading and the experiential phenomena outlined by zwaan.
we believe that broadening the concept of interpretation to encompass physical manifestations is a promising avenue for further exploration.
nevertheless, research on the influence of action and sensory mechanisms on interpretation is still in its early stages and largely relies on individual sentences in studies.
the question of whether understanding complex, action-packed narratives necessitates constant engagement with action and sensory systems remains to be proven conclusively.
limiting the flow of activation could result in additional outcomes and potentially provide explanations for other observations.
for instance, a targeted activation process could help address the apparent paradox where words that can be easily visualized are generated faster and more accurately, yet are more susceptible to substitution errors.
specifically, when visualizable words hold deeper meanings or are linked to more extensive semantic networks, their retrieval might trigger the activation of a broader range of semantically related word meanings.
if this widespread activation does not lead to competition at the lexical level, the correct word representation should not face interference from other word options.
consequently, the intended word's enhanced activation could be readily selected without hindrance.
hence, a language production model should elucidate how speakers generate utterances efficiently within processing limitations, while also adhering to grammatical rules, albeit usually.
it must be recognized that even if this interpretation is accurate, haywood and colleagues observed the altruistic use of optional functional elements rather than egocentric.
additionally, skilled speakers are likely more adept at avoiding ambiguity than less experienced ones, indicating the existence of mechanisms to help speakers monitor their speech and incorporate optional elements when beneficial for listeners.
however, what remains unknown is how this potentially resource-intensive process is synchronized with other tasks executed by the production system.
a crucial inquiry for future studies on the relationship between syntax and prosody in language production revolves around whether these two elements are truly separate entities, or if prosodic features and performance phenomena can be attributed to the same fundamental reasons.
another key consideration is whether establishing a separate level of prosodic organization is essential to address aspects like rhythm and intonational phrasing, or if the syntactic framework alone can elucidate prosodic patterns in spoken sentences.
a drawback of existing research is that most investigations into prosody during production have relied on straightforward reading or repetition tasks to prompt responses.
this approach is necessary to ensure precise control over the speaker's utterances for thorough testing of prosodic and syntactic theories.
in the hypothetical scenarios discussed in this context, the presence of the ldg should be seen as compelling evidence of phonological voicelessness.
however, in each case, the possibility of a vot in the short-lag range has been identified, sometimes mistakenly interpreted as a phonological error involving a voiced-for-voiceless substitution.
these hypothetical situations are physiologically plausible and represent clear phonetic anomalies.
therefore, it is cautioned against immediately labeling the production of a voiceless stop target with a short-lag vot as a phonological error, unless supported by further evidence.
the most reliable evidence would involve direct observation of the larynx during the articulation of voiceless stop targets, but this may not be practical in many clinical settings and is specialized even in research contexts.
fortunately, supplementing vot measures with acoustic assessments and observations can help elucidate the underlying physiological mechanisms related to a potential voiced-for-voiceless substitution.
functional brain imaging has quickly emerged as a highly effective tool for investigating the involvement of various brain structures in language production and comprehension.
this technology enables the measurement of brain activity linked to communication processes, offering unprecedented accuracy and precision compared to traditional chronometric or electrophysiological methods.
by non-invasively pinpointing neural activity, functional brain imaging has opened up new avenues for advancing our understanding of language processing in both healthy individuals and those with neurological disorders.
by integrating neuroimaging techniques into language research, researchers have been able to independently test theories proposed by experimental psychologists to elucidate the intricate mechanisms underlying this uniquely human ability.
recently, integrating it with a range of electrophysiological methods has expanded the investigation possibilities, enabling models of language processing that not only depict the spatial distribution of cognitive processes but also their timing.
this has offered new insights into how information flows during communication.
the swift advancement in functional neuroimaging technologies continues unabated, with limitations in our capability to detect neural activity at increasingly precise spatial and temporal levels being mainly restricted by engineering and financial factors rather than physical constraints.
in essence, the presence of acoustic noise in mri machines is an inevitable byproduct of their operation.
this noise can have various intricate effects such as masking stimuli, altering task difficulty, disrupting selective attention, and reducing the dynamic range of the auditory system.
when designing experiments focused on language processing, the impact of scanner noise on neural activity estimation could potentially hinder the accuracy of results, especially when subtractive logic assumptions are not applicable.
these methods vary in their effectiveness and practicality, as well as the level of comfort they offer.
while they all to some extent help in minimizing head movement, none fully address the artifacts caused by movement of the mouth or the brain's internal motion due to factors like the heartbeat and breathing.
given that the precision of fmri results primarily suffers from the interference of head movements in the statistical analysis of brain activity linked to tasks, and the current software for adjusting images has not proven entirely effective with successive echoplanar image sets, it is evident that more advanced techniques are imperative to mitigate all forms of subject motion.
movement of the articulators, especially those involving significant jaw motion, can lead to challenging image artifacts that are hard to eliminate during post-processing.
the common observation that these artifacts linked to articulatory motion might produce noticeable false-positive signals has caused many researchers to prematurely dismiss fmri as a viable method for investigating the neural processes of speech.
this is mainly because experimental setups requiring spoken responses inevitably entail jaw movements that can create susceptibility artifacts in specific brain regions such as the medial and inferior temporal cortex, crucial for language processing.
such artifacts, caused by susceptibility changes induced by jaw actions, can also cause signal loss and image distortions in adjacent brain areas, with the extent varying based on the articulators' positioning for articulating a particular word.
interleaved approaches involve spending less time performing the target task, resulting in the subject making fewer responses during imaging compared to a continuous acquisition experiment of the same duration.
this reduction leads to a lower sensitivity in interleaved techniques due to the smaller sample size collected in each acquisition period.
however, the decreased power resulting from the smaller sample size might be counterbalanced by the frequent alternation between target and control tasks in interleaved gradients.
this alternation reduces response habituation and enhances task-related signal modulation.
interleaved techniques are favored for their minimal sensitivity to acoustic and motion disturbances, consequently producing activity maps that are on par with or superior to those generated with continuous acquisition.
this is attributed to the decreased likelihood of inter-scan head movement, leading to less temporal misalignment of images and thereby yielding higher statistical significance.
moreover, interleaved methods involve a longer tr, enhancing sensitivity to subtle signal fluctuations by improving the contrast-to-noise ratio.
the paragraph further outlines recent fmri studies exploring the neural underpinnings of cognitive processing during speech responses, utilizing both continuous and interleaved techniques with block and event-related timing paradigms.
the prohibition on employing speech responses in functional mri studies is considered unnecessary, despite the potential for significant artifacts in statistical maps due to jaw movement.
by utilizing event-related and interleaved data acquisition methods, the impact of acoustic gradient noise on identifying and estimating spatial and temporal patterns of task-related activity can be significantly diminished.
future enhancements in mr imaging technology will feature improved acoustic isolation for subjects and active noise cancellation functions, enabling more realistic communication research in considerably quieter experimental settings.
after discussing fundamental principles governing perception, a framework will be introduced for understanding speech perception.
this framework is considered modest as it draws on established knowledge of general processes of perception and learning.
furthermore, it takes a cautious approach by refraining from making arbitrary claims about how speech is processed uniquely, and avoids depending on higher-level cognitive functions.
the key assertion is that speech perception operates similarly to the perception of other stimuli and environmental inputs.
the perceptual processes for speech adhere to a set of basic principles that are applied across various levels of processing, from the initial stages through the central nervous system, in both complex and simpler manners.
waveforms in sound sources appear identical even when produced by different sources, restricting their complexity to the physical characteristics of the sources.
in the realm of speech perception research, the concept of perceiving via articulatory gestures has been commonly used to simplify understanding.
efforts have been made to identify these gestures to enhance machine speech recognition, although achieving only limited success.
nevertheless, physics dictates that representing speech with articulatory gestures may create an illusion of simplicity.
scientists excel at capturing detailed sound information rather than articulator movements, rendering articulatory gestures seemingly simpler due to their abstract definitions and less precise measurements.
as various resonator arrangements can generate identical waveforms, the acoustic information perceivable by listeners consistently trivializes the diversity in articulation.
the concept of orthogonality presents an intriguing aspect in two ways.
firstly, while optimal efficiency is achieved when each vector is uncorrelated with all others, attaining complete orthogonality within a neural system is often impractical.
secondly, a more enlightening viewpoint emerges.
in this context, perception is depicted as a series of sequential processes, each dedicated to extracting redundancies from preceding outputs.
should the outputs of earlier processes trend towards orthogonality, the idea of reverting to correlation might seem increasingly improbable.
the key to overcoming this apparent impasse lies in the progressive reduction of redundancy, leading to an expansion of the information space across dimensions such as space, frequency, time, and other pertinent factors.
consequently, local statistical relationships do not confine correlations at subsequent processing stages on a coarser scale.
the principles that elucidate categorical perception and perceptual organization development in the first year of life also apply to predicting the ease or difficulty of acquiring new speech contrasts in a second language.
in the context of a single language's sounds, distinctive attributes are linked to each consonant or vowel to enhance differentiation.
this same concept, based on habitual co-occurrence of acoustic attributes, governs how listeners recognize sounds in a second language, whether they are familiar or unfamiliar.
three fundamental interaction patterns exist between perceptual organization in one's native language and the interpretation of sounds from a second language.
a speaker can rely on a listener to understand the approximate meaning of any genuine and relevant message simply by expressing it.
for both the speaker and the listener, speech serves as a medium and a connection in the routine flow of communication, through which courtesies or ideas are shared, collaboration is arranged, and obedience is enforced.
yet, the question arises: should an essay on speech be included in a book on language?
to a novice, it may seem obvious that conversational partners comprehend each other's words solely through hearing the sounds of spoken language.
from this standpoint, the basics of speech comprehension appear to be rooted in psychoacoustics, which involves breaking down speech understanding into sensory discrimination and auditory classification.
however, the novice may already discern variations in auditory characteristics between children and adults, or different speech qualities in face-to-face versus telephone conversations, leading to the suspicion that understanding spoken messages involves more than just acute listening skills.
variations in the acoustic spectrum are not consistent across the formants due to the individual manipulation of articulators that control formant frequencies.
this results in uncorrelated differences between the formants in terms of the degree, progression, and timing of changes in frequency and amplitude.
it is uncommon for the first, second, third, nasal, and fricative formants to change equally in vocal sound production.
perceptual organization combines sensory cues of speech without depending on similarities in changes across the resonances.
in certain transformations of speech spectra, the frequency changes in the resonances may be indiscernible without affecting overall perceptual coherence.
however, the interference with organization was most significant when the lure varied in frequency along with a second formant pattern, less noticeable when it followed a second formant's pace and pattern but with a smaller frequency range, and had no impact when it maintained a constant frequency.
essentially, the extent to which the lure disrupted perceptual organization was contingent on the speech-like characteristics of its frequency changes alone, as this singular varying tone did not trigger phonetic associations that conflicted with those of the spoken sentence.
in this situation, it is expected that multimodal perception will be compromised due to the overall impact of lacking visual and auditory perception.
surprisingly, the combination turned out to be satisfactory, possibly indicating the effectiveness of merging auditory and visual inputs when each alone was insufficient.
this discovery, among others, provides evidence for a shared dimensionality between visual and auditory speech inputs before further analysis.
in the past, studies on speech's perceptual analysis concentrated on the fundamental elements of language.
language characteristics expressed through speech are made up of components that are structured hierarchically.
sentences consist of clauses, within which phrases are embedded; phrases are constructed from words, words are made up of syllables, and each syllable can contain a sequence of phoneme segments.
phonemes are categorized based on their distinct features, which are a combination of separate attributes that create a system of differences within the segmented inventory of a language.
classifying phonemes into categories and the criteria used for such classification can sometimes spark controversy, especially when certain types of evidence gain or lose significance.
despite these disagreements, there is a general consensus that understanding speech involves deciphering basic linguistic components present in short spoken phrases, with more complex linguistic structures being mentally constructed by combining these basic elements perceived through speech.
while the implications of phonetic representation of phonemic differences will not be discussed in detail currently, this topic will be revisited shortly.
establishing a perceptual focus that is linguistic, segmented, and contrasting characterizes the outcomes of perception, yet disagreements persist regarding the underlying causes.
the varying viewpoints surrounding this debate revolve around the type of perceptual examination producing linguistic entities.
proponents are divided on this fundamental aspect, suggesting that the perception of speech is reliant on auditory acuity and grouping, articulation, or linguistic purpose.
despite the age of these theories, the standoff seems never-ending.
while we will present a suggestion shortly, it's imperative to delve into some of the technical specifics first.
the availability of direct methods for measuring sound had a curious impact on the traditional articulatory descriptions when supplemented by more objective measurements.
the technical description of fundamental speech acoustics posed a dilemma for those advocating for acoustic descriptions, as it also challenged the conceptualization of articulation.
research exploring both speech production and perception struggled to align with the theoretical descriptions of phonemes across the articulatory, acoustic, and auditory domains.
the conventional notion that speech was akin to a visual semaphore, where each phoneme represented a distinct vocal gesture or each segment a unique acoustic signal, was disrupted.
whether viewed as articulatory actions, their resulting acoustic properties, or their psychoacoustic effects, the lack of consistency in linguistically contrasting phoneme segments and their diverse realizations became apparent.
in each realm, the connection between a phoneme and its articulatory and acoustic manifestations turned out to be complex and varied.
this method effectively illustrates the diverse articulatory and acoustic characteristics associated with each phoneme, emphasizing the absence of a uniform physical representation for phonemes.
the articulation of a phoneme is influenced by the surrounding segments, which play a role in its encoding, demonstrating that phonemes are always influenced by coarticulation.
according to liberman et al., this encoding strategy ensures efficient transmission of segments despite limitations in anatomical speed.
however, this approach may obscure the connection between the intended or perceived phoneme and its articulatory and acoustic properties.
consequently, speech phonetically represents an abstract series of intended phonemes.
in the perceptual account proposed by articulatory phonology and direct realism, two crucial axioms are assumed.
while not entirely untrue, they may not align completely with the demands of the account.
the first axiom posits an isomorphism between language components responsible for creating contrast and the gestures used in speech acts, treating them as a unified set.
the second axiom suggests a parity between speakers and listeners, asserting that the forms expressed and perceived are identical.
these axioms are interrelated: individuals sharing a language utilize the same standard contrasts.
any variations in expression or repeated gestural variations by a speaker can lead to adjustments in the relationship between standard and expressed forms, causing phonemic and phonetic forms to diverge.
in such cases, additional articulatory freedom is required for expressions beyond what is strictly canonical in word formation.
can phonology provide insights into the phonetic realizations that originate from standard lexical forms versus those influenced by individual non-lexical expressions?
dialects and idiolects significantly contribute to language structure.
the phonetic cues used to differentiate between various communities and speakers both share the same phonetic properties during production as lexical distinctions.
a comprehensive model may need to consider how long-standing or temporary expressive goals impact the articulatory parameters in producing speech, leading to consistent variations in standard lexical forms that go beyond usual coarticulation and speech rate influences.
however, discrepancies between standard and expressed forms reduce the clarity of perceiving lexical contrasts through speech's public aspects.
in the absence of perfect alignment, listeners must distinguish between canonical gestures and non-lexical elements like dialect, idiolect, emotion, and attitude conveyed through phonetic qualities within the speech stream.
the principle of parity refers to the similarity in language patterns used by a speaker when constructing a statement and by a listener when interpreting it.
in this context, parity specifically relates to the nonverbal aspects of language, which is entirely appropriate.
while lexical parity may be disregarded at times — such as when people use different words like "lightning bug" and "firefly," "sack" and "bag," or "trash" and "garbage" in conversations — as long as the communicative intent aligns, variations in vocabulary are tolerated.
since the 1960s, there have been continuous efforts to introduce voiceprint analysis as admissible evidence in court proceedings, showing some degree of success.
typically, a voiceprint examiner or earwitness will select the voice from a lineup that bears the closest resemblance to the original speaker, although at times they may refrain from making a definitive choice.
experienced voiceprint analysts, in particular, often choose not to make a selection.
nevertheless, when a crime victim provides earwitness testimony, the desire to identify the offender may outweigh the inherent uncertainty in such identification tasks, potentially leading to misidentifications.
additionally, any conclusions drawn from relative similarities are highly dependent on the available options.
for a fair assessment, a lineup for talker identification should consist of a sole suspect paired with a group of individuals who are confirmed innocent but share similarities with the suspect in terms of sex, gender, accent, height, age, weight, socio-economic background, and educational level.
in this discussion about the theoretical and empirical examination of speech perception, our focus has been on highlighting the underlying principles behind both traditional and contemporary interpretations.
rather than providing an exhaustive review of research paradigms in this dynamic field, our approach centers on viewing speech as a vehicle for language expression.
as a result of this stance, speech perception is portrayed as the mechanism through which spoken language is understood as coherent audible and visible events, as sequences of recognizable linguistic structures, as the unique output of a speaker, and as a template for recurrent self-expression.
these interconnected facets of speech perception are seen as commonplace experiences for speakers and listeners, not reliant on specific research methodologies or unresolved questions for validation.
future studies will help determine the practicality of the perspective presented here in facilitating the quest for fresh evidence aimed at refining the descriptive and explanatory investigations into speech perception.
in the realm of interactive perception, leveraging top-down information to help make sense of bottom-up information can uphold accurate perception if there is a proper balance in weighing both types of inputs.
challenging this concept proves to be quite complex.
it requires putting forward different rationales for lexical effects and demonstrating that when these rationales generate predictions diverging from those based on lexical feedback, the latter are flawed.
in the past twenty years, the ongoing dispute has seemed to reach resolutions on multiple occasions, with purported contradictions emerging for both independent and interactive viewpoints.
the latest model, known as the distributed cohort model, breaks away from the conventional view by eliminating the separation between initial contact and selection.
it incorporates semantic features into lexical representations, leading to the simultaneous activation of both semantic and phonological knowledge through bottom-up input.
this updated approach, which discards the theoretical processing distinction between form and meaning, aligns with research demonstrating a seamless integration of various sources of information to derive the interpretation of spoken input.
the chapter is organized as follows: to start, there will be a brief overview of the significance of word recognition research in cognitive psychology, psycholinguistics, and cognitive neuroscience.
the next section will delve into evidence concerning letter recognition, sublexical organization, and lexical-level influences on word recognition, with intermittent discussions on current theoretical advancements and debates.
following that, a review of literature on context and priming effects in word recognition will be provided, emphasizing major theoretical progressions and debates.
subsequently, the chapter will explore limitations in drawing inferences based on existing data and spotlight recent developments that offer further insight into these matters.
we will now examine various factors that have been explored in word recognition studies.
initially, we will aim to deconstruct words into more manageable segments.
next, we will delve into research concerning how spelling corresponds to pronunciation in english.
following this, we will explore the impact of quantifiable factors such as word frequency, familiarity, age of learning, orthographic similarities, and semantic variables at the whole-word level.
finally, we will summarize how contextual cues influence the recognition of individual words, drawing from an analysis of priming studies.
throughout these sections, we will intersperse discussions on prominent theoretical models and key issues.
furthermore, as discussed later, there is a persistent occurrence of word-level frequency effect in tasks involving response latency as well as perceptual identification.
this suggests an apparent distinction in frequency effects at varying levels of the processing system, specifically between letters and words.
additionally, this introduces a recurring theme found throughout word recognition studies, where diverse tasks or analyses result in varying data patterns.
thus, researchers must design tasks that not only target specific dimensions in word processing but also align with the tasks utilized to assess these dimensions.
it is essential to highlight that the plaut et al.
model was a recurrent neural network that ultimately reached a stable state, allowing for the assessment of response latencies.
in this model, changes in the activation of phonological units occur gradually over time as information accumulates and is exchanged among network units.
this distinctive characteristic differs from the error evaluation method employed in the original seidenberg and mcclelland model.
upon word recognition in the plaut et al.
model, activation spreads through the network starting from the corresponding grapheme units.
in the word anvil, the third letter is part of the second syllable, while for vodka, the third letter is part of the first syllable.
if syllables create a perceptual grouping, errors in reporting colors might occur, such that the d in vodka could be more likely to be reported in the same color as the o rather than the k.
similarly, the v in anvil might be more likely to be reported in the color of the i rather than the n.
these findings align with the results of the prinzmetal et al.
while estimates may vary, on average, an adult reader is believed to possess a lexicon of around 50,000 words.
these words are constructed using a limited set of 26 letters, resulting in significant shared spelling patterns across multiple words.
a critical aspect of a valid word recognition model involves elucidating how the system identifies the correct lexical representation amidst clusters of closely related orthographic forms.
it is conceivable that the presence of similar spelling patterns may not impact lexical processing, and that a solitary representation reaching a threshold is adequate for recognition.
nevertheless, as previously indicated, words seem to be acknowledged not in isolation but in connection to other orthographically associated representations.
the implications that meaning-level representations may have on isolated word recognition could significantly impact current word recognition models.
existing models primarily focus on the stages individuals go through to access the mental lexicon, giving less direct consideration to meaning-level factors.
however, acknowledging that orthographic patterns serve the purpose of conveying meaning and not just lexicality could lead to a model with an early integration of meaning.
it is not surprising then that meaning-level representations might play a role in early perceptual analyses and assist in word recognition.
while recent connectionist and dual-route models recognize these effects, the challenge lies in effectively implementing such meaning-level influences.
every model offers interesting alternative viewpoints on the effects of semantic priming.
currently, no single model comprehensively explains the depth and variety found in this body of research.
thus, it seems necessary to propose multiple mechanisms to fully explain the wide range of semantic priming effects within the field of theory development.
the models discussed earlier exhibit a primarily passive architecture, involving various systems that gather information over time.
however, there are situations where it may be beneficial for the reader to adjust the impact of a particular pathway depending on the task requirements or specific reading context.
for instance, when proofreading, comprehending, or evaluating grammaticality, one would anticipate a shift in focus among different systems.
nearly every word recognition theory suggests various methods for accessing or calculating the phonological code from text.
in the drc model, the phonological code can be computed through the lexical route, which links the entire word to a lexical representation for phonology access, or through the sublexical route, which derives phonology from spelling-to-sound correspondences.
in pdp models, phonology computation can be influenced by emphasizing direct orthographic-to-phonological connections or indirect connections through semantics.
this raises the question of whether there is any ability to control which processing pathway affects task performance.
while there is increasing evidence supporting a certain degree of pathway control, additional research is needed in this domain.
the degree to which attentional systems regulate information within different pathways holds significant implications for future modeling efforts, aligning with task-specific influences highlighted in the current chapter.
furthermore, considering time criterion perspectives is crucial for comprehending how the word recognition system adapts to the specific limitations of an experiment and may also offer valuable insights for other cognitive paradigms reliant on response times.
viewing time criterion effects as a form of attentional control provides a nuanced understanding at this level.
overall, we hope that the reader can see the parallel between the word and its significance to cognitive psychologists and psycholinguists compared to the cell's importance to biologists.
both involve intricate substructures and interactions with various higher-level systems.
while delving into the word recognition literature may seem daunting, progress has undeniably been made, particularly in the past decade.
despite the seemingly straightforward nature of comprehending lexical analyses, the reality is more complex.
as our understanding of systems deepens, we refine techniques for formulating and limiting future inquiries.
with the emergence of new analytical approaches, the upcoming decade is poised to offer an exciting period of research.
in a follow-up experiment, words from both function and content word categories were displayed in a primed naming task.
despite controlling for word length, frequency, and sentence position, neither the naming task nor the initial processing time measurements displayed any discernible lexical processing distinctions between the two word classes.
nonetheless, there were correlations between word frequency and word class in subsequent processing measurements, which were interpreted as indicative of the distinct functions that these word types serve in the comprehension of textual meaning.
by framing issues of resolving unclear meanings of words as assessments of modularity, the idea of exhaustive access was linked to a method of access unaffected by context, while theories promoting selective access relied heavily on contextual cues.
as indicated in this concise overview, substantial evidence supports the notion that readers navigate through various word meanings and that this navigation is swayed by the dominance of these meanings and the surrounding context.
consequently, current findings suggest the necessity of hybrid models that accommodate the swift activation of diverse meanings and the initial impact of the sentence's context.
the re-ordered access model reflects modern hybrid models.
however, the different models vary in their perspective on whether exhaustive access is obligatory or very probable, and in their interpretation of what happens to meanings that are not chosen for incorporation into the discourse representation.
despite acknowledging that context can impact the sequence in which meanings are accessed, the models do not elaborate much on the specific characteristics of the sentence context that generate these outcomes.
in the upcoming sections, we will address each of these concerns individually.
the results of the study revealed a reverse pattern of processing time in the post-target region.
when the meaning of the word switched, there was a delay in processing time.
conversely, when the meaning remained consistent with the initial encounter, no improvement in processing time was noticed in that region.
in a subsequent experiment, the meaning of the ambiguous word consistently changed between the first and second encounters.
however, the context in between either stayed on the original topic or shifted to a new one.
a topic shift was defined as a change in the main character and the setting.
if the processing delay observed in the post-target region in the prior experiment was attributed to the challenge of integrating the chosen meaning into a discourse representation that included the other meaning of the word, this delay should decrease when the discourse topic changes, as the prior concept is no longer as prominent in the discourse representation.
this same reasoning was applied to the initial processing time of the target word.
quillian highlighted various structural aspects of this particular perspective on semantic memory.
firstly, every attribute and its corresponding value within each binding were considered individual entries, each with its own associated set of related bindings.
secondly, there existed no strict hierarchical structure throughout the entire semantic memory.
each entry served as the foundation of its unique hierarchy while also being encompassed within numerous other hierarchies stemming from different entries.
thirdly, the chains of bindings stemming from a primary root entry had the ability to reference back recursively to the same root entry.
this means that an entry like "canary" could be present as either an attribute or value within an indirect binding under the root entry "canary." for instance, beginning with the verb "to fly," one might encounter a loop such as "fly, wing, feather, bird, fly." these types of longer or shorter recursive loops were observed to be quite commonplace.
therefore, the processing of syntax and meaning commences promptly without significant delay.
this could imply that the processor operates with an architecture that swiftly integrates various information sources.
nevertheless, this idea has sparked considerable debate, as we will discuss shortly.
initially, we will examine theories and evidence concerning the initial processing phase.
subsequently, we will delve into aspects of reanalysis and processing intricacy, followed by an exploration of recent parsing research topics that establish crucial connections between the field and other domains of psycholinguistics and cognition at large.
according to their argument regarding the ovs order, individuals expect the postverbal noun to represent a new element in the conversation, leading to increased processing challenges in ovs sentences within a supportive context due to the associated processing cost.
conversely, there is no anticipation of discourse characteristics for the postverbal noun in the svo order, as it could be either novel or previously mentioned.
their hypothesis was substantiated through a visual-world eye-tracking study, indicating that participants were more likely to fixate on a new referent prior to hearing the postverbal noun in ovs sentences compared to svo sentences.
this implies that the difficulty experienced in processing ovs sentences in an appropriate context may stem from the expectation of encountering a new discourse entity.
moreover, compelling evidence suggests that individuals leverage both linguistic and visual cues within referential context while processing sentences.
notably, in certain instances of ambiguity, linguistic and visual context can supersede syntactic inclinations present in the absence of context.
these influences become apparent early in the processing stages, as indicated by current research methods.
conversely, in cases where preferences are more robust in the absence of context, contextual clues may not entirely eliminate these existing biases.
this aligns with constraint-based models, positing that context exerts prompt influence on sentence comprehension, though alternative information sources could, on occasion, be potent enough to counteract such effects.
up to now, our emphasis has been on the conventional inquiry regarding the first phases of parsing, specifically examining how individuals arrive at initial decisions.
previous studies have often utilized garden-path sentences where the initially preferred interpretation proves to be incorrect, assuming that individuals subsequently engage in a reanalysis process.
the exploration of how this reanalysis occurs was notably limited for a significant period.
nevertheless, various research avenues have been dedicated to investigating reanalysis, and this segment aims to consolidate these findings.
previous studies concerning reanalysis have typically assumed that individuals understand the process required when they detect a misanalysis: they need to try to develop the accurate analysis.
however, at times, the situation may not be as clear-cut, as the cognitive system may still present more than one potential solution.
in such cases, what approach does the cognitive system take?
does it follow the same strategies it would have employed if encountering the same ambiguity during the initial analysis?
while this may seem like the most logical course, advocates of modular models often assert that syntax-based principles are employed due to the early availability of such information compared to other types of information.
on the contrary, reanalysis could potentially consider all pertinent details and thus function based on different principles than those utilized during the initial analysis.
moreover, it might factor in the level of complexity involved in transitioning from the initial analysis to each possible new analysis.
this review highlights that the majority of studies on sentence processing have remained focused on conventional topics like the factors influencing processing at the start, reanalysis, and structural complexity.
it is now evident that strictly modular explanations of initial processing, such as the traditional garden-path theory, are not accurate.
instead, the processor utilizes various sources of information during initial processing.
nevertheless, there is compelling evidence to suggest that structural information does influence sentence processing and cannot be simply reduced to a collection of loosely connected constraints.
while research has demonstrated the significance of discourse context, plausibility, and frequency in sentence processing, they do not always supersede the fundamental preferences for specific structural patterns.
the aim of this chapter is to examine specific literature concerning prosodic processing in adult speakers and listeners, focusing on prosodic phrasing and sentence-level prominence.
the chapter's structure includes a historical overview of early efforts to comprehend the impact of prosodic structure on understanding, addressing key issues that drive research in this field and discussing methodological challenges inherent in studying prosodic effects.
following this, common phonetic measures and phonological annotation methods used to describe prosody in production data and spoken experimental materials are briefly reviewed.
the discussion also covers the creation of experimental materials and emphasizes the importance of accurately defining prosodic form for comprehending and replicating prosodic effects in processing.
subsequently, current research findings on prosodic phrasing and its connection to syntactic processing, as well as prosodic prominence in relation to information structure and interaction with phrasing, are presented.
the relationship between prosodic structure and other linguistic levels like syntax and discourse structure involves multiple mappings.
ambiguities in the speech signal conveying prosodic structure can complicate this relationship significantly.
this complexity poses challenges for psycholinguistic research, as grammatical stimuli can be diverse, leading to ambiguity and potential discrepancies across studies.
however, this intricate link between prosody and other structures can be advantageous for researchers, offering insights into the mechanisms of language processing.
by carefully outlining the phonology and phonetics of experimental materials, researchers can leverage ambiguities to better understand how specific prosodic elements impact the comprehension process.
evidence from studies on language comprehension provides valuable insights into understanding how listeners use prosodic structure to process spoken language.
equally important is investigating whether speakers naturally produce the same types of prosodic structures examined in lab studies.
while there is a vast body of research on the production of prosodic form, this chapter focuses on discussing production methods utilized to develop stimuli for research on spoken language comprehension.
the studies mentioned have explored how prosodic phrasing affects the understanding of syntax during language comprehension by focusing on a single aspect of prosody.
in laboratory settings, researchers often regulate the placement and type of accent in spoken language to specifically examine the impact of prosodic phrasing.
recent research in english has expanded to include manipulation of pitch accents alone or in conjunction with phrasing.
the discussion in this section proposes two main conclusions drawn from the research on accent and phrasing.
the mention of math in the answers was considered new information when the questions did not include math, whereas it was seen as given information when math was mentioned in the questions.
the answers were categorized into three accentual patterns - v np, np, and v - depending on the question types.
in the first two patterns, both the word "math" and the preceding verb were accented, while in the v pattern, only the verb was accented.
overall, there is still much progress needed in processing accounts to elucidate the collaborative role of different components in prosodic representation on impacting sentence comprehension across various levels.
questions remain as to how factors such as segmental, lexical, syntactic, semantic, and discourse elements may affect prosody perception and how this interaction occurs.
while the current focus has been on english studies, successful processing models should be able to clarify the commonalities and distinctions in processing among languages with diverse prosodic structures.
a comprehensive grasp of language comprehension entails a thorough comprehension of the various composition operations available to comprehenders and how these operations interact with the broader language processing system.
achieving this understanding will necessitate psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic studies that distinguish and assess the different operations engaged in semantic composition.
the focus will be on determining the computational cost of these operations for the language processor and investigating the reasons behind variations in costliness.
nonetheless, the initial crucial task involves accurately pinpointing the potential operations involved.
overall, in cases where one syntactic element has the role of selecting another element as its argument, the semantic composition is termed functional application.
a significant amount of psycholinguistic studies, briefly summarized later on, have delved into how argument structures affect parsing and understanding.
from the perspective presented in this framework, this research can be seen as exploring how functional application operates in real-time.
moving forward, we explore scenarios where two elements merge without a selectional relationship.
while the interpretive principles outlined in section 2 have broad empirical support, certain semantic situations require more complex interpretive processes.
we offer a survey of constructions that present challenges to the straightforward perspective outlined thus far.
initially, we examine instances of type mismatch, in which elements can interact despite not forming a suitable structural context for functional application or predicate modification.
subsequently, we explore scenarios wherein a portion of a sentence's meaning is implied without being explicitly articulated by any syntactic elements, and cannot be derived through fundamental compositional activities.
studies in psycholinguistics have primarily focused on examining how compositionality is processed by looking into two key areas: complement coercion and aspectual coercion.
these phenomena entail a semantic incongruity and have been posited to pose a challenge to the principle of strong compositionality.
research on these constructs has concentrated on either their structural interpretation or their cognitive processing, often lacking a comprehensive integration of both aspects.
here, we assess the extent to which these instances necessitate interpretive mechanisms beyond syntax by considering conventional linguistic proof alongside findings from psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic investigations.
if coercion necessitates an additional process beyond the standard set of interpretive rules, coerced sentences are expected to impose higher processing costs compared to noncoerced equivalents.
our focus then shifts to examining processing metrics to determine if coerced sentences entail real-time generation of an event predicate from an np denoting an entity.
additionally, if resolving the mismatch in coercion entails constructing an event structure as opposed to solely retrieving a relevant activity, it should be feasible to observe a processing delay not solely attributable to activity retrieval.
having delved into various instances of opaque composition, recent experimental inquiries have just scratched the surface, leaving numerous unanswered questions.
nevertheless, as underscored previously, our stance is that examining real-time semantic composition processes should draw from the intricate hypothesis framework laid out by theoretical semantics.
with this objective in mind, we reexamine each of these instances in section 3 to assess their representational foundation.
the aim is to determine whether we can anticipate comparable or divergent processing mechanisms by leveraging our existing knowledge and reasoning of their representations.
this model was created to replicate forecasts of a two-stage model, where the mv interpretation is applied in the initial stage and the utilization of non-syntactic details is withheld until the subsequent stage.
discovered that the more interactive model aligned better with the data compared to the model delaying non-syntactic constraints.
they contended that integrating modeling offers a more robust assessment of different hypotheses than solely relying on empirical studies, as the modeling process compels adherence to specific assertions concerning the interplay of constraints and their temporal progression.
therefore, while low-level variables play a significant role in determining the next fixation point, identifying the word to the right of the fixation during the current fixation can result in a shift in the decision regarding the subsequent target word.
while eye-movement data are typically valued as the top choice in sentence parsing studies, their influence in discourse processes and inferences research has been relatively minimal.
it is somewhat unexpected considering the significance of pinpointing the moment readers draw inferences while reading, a potential that eye-movement data could uncover.
this section will examine previous research utilizing eye movements in this context, suggesting a likely increase in eye-movement studies focusing on discourse processes and inferences in the near future.
in our view, a reading model should offer a comprehensive explanation of a significant portion of the reading process while remaining simple enough to serve as a practical tool for identifying what it can and cannot elucidate.
currently, various research initiatives are creating quantitative models of eye movements during reading.
despite their diverse approaches, these models commonly overlook textual parsing and discourse structure construction.
some emphasize the impact of lexical processes on eye movements, while others attribute reading eye movements mainly to lower-level perceptual and motor functions or ideal observer procedures.
it remains an open question whether this accurately reflects the reading process.
nonetheless, we consider it a logical point of departure for analyzing how reading unfolds.
by understanding the initial stage, modeling no longer appears daunting; instead, it enables the definition of a clear set of eye movement data to study: all eye movements during reading except when the eyes go back to previous words.
let's explore how this can be achieved.
in conclusion, it is evident that eye movements remain a valuable method for examining the ongoing processes involved in reading.
despite the challenges observed in analyzing eye movements related to syntax or higher-level semantic processing, when it comes to understanding the continuous mental activities during reading, there are few other techniques that offer the same level of temporal accuracy as eye movements do.
one key factor contributing to the consistency of n400 latencies in the visual domain could be the steady timing of perceptual processes across different psycholinguistic categories of stimuli.
the perceptual details regarding a word's identity are likely to reach the brain regions responsible for processing meaning almost simultaneously, irrespective of contextual variations.
additionally, a single word presents its visual information all at once, often being processed as a cohesive visual pattern.
in contrast, the acoustic signal of speech lasts for a longer duration, causing the accumulation of information about a word's identity over time.
this characteristic of speech allows for a more detailed exploration of the temporal interplay between perceptual and semantic activities.
it is evident that there are connections between syntax and semantics during online processing, as seen in studies involving double violation as well as manipulation of discourse context, which seem to impact morphosyntactic parsing.
furthermore, erp components such as n400, p600, and lan do not show up earlier than 200 ms after the stimulus onset in the erp record.
whether these interactions consistently include or exclude the elan remains a question that requires more research for a conclusive answer.
in fairy tales, we anticipate characters with magical abilities and talking animals, while futuristic technologies like spaceships are not typically part of the narrative.
on the other hand, in science fiction, advanced technology is a common element, while magical creatures or wizardly tools may not play a significant role.
the intrigue in riddles lies in the element of surprise as listeners are uncertain about the type of expectation to set.
consequently, the comprehension of discourse heavily relies on the ability to incorporate and apply relevant background knowledge.
initially, you categorize items into various groups, potentially needing just one pile depending on the workload.
if lacking proper facilities, the next step involves relocating; otherwise, you're essentially ready to proceed.
it's crucial not to overexert oneself; rather, it's preferable to tackle a few tasks simultaneously than to take on too many.
while it may not appear significant initially, complications can easily arise, making mistakes costly.
initially, the procedure may seem complex, but eventually, it becomes routine.
predicting an end to the necessity of this task in the near future is challenging, as unforeseen circumstances can always arise.
upon completion of the procedure, items are once again sorted into distinct groups and placed in designated locations.
they will eventually be utilized again, restarting the entire cycle, as part of the natural progression of life.
one major benefit of fmri methodology is its ability to capture brain activity within a significantly smaller temporal window compared to pet scans.
this feature is particularly advantageous when studying brief cognitive processes, such as language processing which may occur within tens of milliseconds.
with pet scans, which operate at a slower pace, it becomes challenging to effectively measure such rapid cognitive activities.
unlike pet which generates a single average image over an extended period, fmri allows for the acquisition of multiple images across consecutive temporal windows, enabling the examination of moment-to-moment changes in brain activation.
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) studies enable the recording of button-press data and response times, while other data collection techniques pose challenges.
obtaining vocalization responses, such as naming times and talk-aloud protocols, is more intricate.
despite advancements in noise-canceling technologies that aid in capturing voice responses in the loud scanning setting, data can still be compromised by head movements induced by jaw actions.
the typical scanning protocol also presents obstacles in gathering discourse recall data during a scanning session.
while these issues can be addressed with diligence, they have not been systematically resolved to date.
in brief, limitations of brain imaging methodologies impact the experimental design of discourse processing studies.
it is crucial to carefully structure passages to enhance the likelihood of understanding how intricate cortical networks operate during discourse comprehension.
each specific process needs to be linked to a precise moment in the text.
furthermore, this process should be consistently identifiable across most passages and for the majority of participants.
for instance, when investigating the creation of a bridging inference, this inference must occur at a consistent point within the text for various stimuli and readers for reliable measurement.
the restricted number of passages and participants hinders the ability to analyze a wide range of passages comprehensively.
despite limitations on experimental design, imaging remains advantageous for studying the overall functioning of neural networks.
this is particularly valuable when processes like inferencing do not occur at distinct temporal points.
therefore, imaging can reveal the cognitive effort needed for drawing inferences even if behavioral cues do not provide clear evidence of when or if an inference was made.
consequently, fmri can detect subtle processes that may not significantly impact behavioral outcomes, while also highlighting the qualitative nuances and simultaneous engagement of processes involved in discourse comprehension, aspects that may not be apparent through response time measurements.
the fmri results indicated that the left hemisphere overall showed no difference in response when reading paragraphs with or without titles, whereas the right hemisphere displayed significantly higher activity when processing untitled paragraphs.
specifically, the left middle and superior temporal sulci were more activated when reading titled paragraphs, whereas the right middle and superior temporal sulci showed increased activation during the task of processing untitled paragraphs.
these findings back the notion that the right hemisphere plays a role in mapping information into textual representation, as elaborated later.
furthermore, the results suggest that there are distinct processing functions carried out by each hemisphere.
the process of identifying the main idea and structuring the text is distinct from linking this information to the discourse structure, with both brain hemispheres collaborating interactively to construct a cohesive text representation.
additionally, the nature of the information in the text influences which brain areas are involved in constructing and preserving the text representation.
information at the propositional level might engage the left frontal and left temporal regions if adequate resources are allocated.
in contrast, processing situational model information involves the medial frontal cortex.
moreover, the specific cortical regions that come into play may vary depending on the type of input; for instance, emotional details concerning the protagonist could activate dorsal frontal areas more prominently.
frequently, the connections between events in a narrative are implied rather than directly stated, requiring the reader to make linking inferences and blend them with the provided information.
most texts rely on readers drawing upon a common understanding of the world.
the relationship between generating inferences and incorporating text is significant.
creating inferences is crucial for constructing precise text interpretations, just as having an accurate text representation is essential for inference generation.
in this chapter, we have outlined research aligning with diverse discourse processing theories.
the research discussed here has played a pivotal role in introducing innovative concepts, including the coarse coding theory of right hemisphere processing, the dynamic activation of cortical networks based on text constraints, the overflow of processing to other specialized networks due to capacity use, and the involvement of a theory of mind network in understanding discourse.
the next step is to explore how modern cortically driven viewpoints on discourse processing align with existing discourse processing theories.
the signal generated by active components in memory operates independently of coherence breaks or relevance and remains constant, self-sustained, and limitless.
any associated information prompted by this signal can be accessed regardless of its relevance.
whether outdated or current, information is equally susceptible to activation; when a reader comes across a specific sentence linked to outdated information, it can trigger the recall of that information, potentially disrupting comprehension despite the reactivation.
this presents us with the challenging task of suggesting that when a text contains high emotional content, prompts an elaborative inference, and presents a clear topic, we would expect to observe a distinct type of network engaged.
creating a multitude of networks that analyze discourse would be as diverse and numerous as the texts under scrutiny.
a more effective strategy would involve expanding on established discourse theories and demonstrating how data from brain regions align with elements of these different theories.
understanding the processing of discourse involves intricate high-level cognitive functions, engaging various aspects of cognition.
neuroimaging studies offer a unique advantage by allowing the exploration of a broad cortical network comprising specialized brain regions, adjusting the cognitive load.
this methodology is highly beneficial for enhancing our comprehension of discourse.
the range of research discussed in this chapter illustrates that we are at the initial stages of leveraging the power of neuroimaging to comprehend discourse more deeply.
each characteristic is individually examined in specific sections, but it is crucial to understand that they are interconnected.
they hold strong correlations not only with each other but also with indicators of comprehension performance.
the comprehension skill theories discussed in our review elaborate on these connections through distinct causal mechanisms.
to visually demonstrate how these theories allocate variance among the five reader characteristics, we feature figures in each section.
it is important to note that these figures do not encompass all possible relationships among the characteristics but rather highlight specific connections emphasized in explanations of variations in comprehension abilities.
in this chapter, figure 1 illustrates the five reader characteristics under discussion.
according to the verbal efficiency theory, three of these characteristics are highlighted: word-level ability, working memory (wm) capacity, and print exposure.
the figure demonstrates a direct correlation between word-level ability and both word-level processes and print exposure.
readers with strong word-identification skills tend to acquire more word knowledge compared to readers with weaker skills, consequently boosting their interest in reading.
regular readers tend to enhance their word-level ability, reinforcing their passion for reading.
additionally, figure 1 presents indirect effects of word-level ability on sentence-level and discourse-level processes through its influence on wm capacity.
inefficient word-level processes can deplete wm resources that could otherwise be utilized for higher-level interpretive tasks.
two primary assessments are frequently employed to evaluate working memory (wm) capacity: the reading-span task and the operation-span task.
during the reading-span task, individuals are required to orally read a series of unconnected sentences one by one and then remember the final word of each sentence after the full set is shown.
conversely, the operation-span task follows a similar pattern but involves solving basic arithmetic problems instead of reading aloud.
in both tasks, the span refers to the maximum number of words that the individual can accurately recall.
the rationale also extends to explaining why adept comprehenders are able to recall more details from text compared to struggling comprehenders.
proficient comprehenders possess effective strategies for storing intricate and cohesive units in memory.
these units are triggered when textual cues prompt their retrieval with incoming information.
conversely, individuals who struggle with comprehension encode information in fragments or disjointed clusters.
consequently, retrieval cues in short-term memory trigger retrieval of small, relatively incomplete, units from long-term memory storage.
there is significant variation among readers in their level of interest, the importance they place on reading, and the time they dedicate to this activity.
scholars have explored various aspects of how reading habits influence comprehension skills and the acquisition of broad knowledge.
a primary inquiry involves whether exposure to printed material enhances comprehension mainly through streamlining word recognition or if it additionally contributes to vocabulary enrichment, understanding of syntax, and the assimilation of cultural and specialized knowledge.
what causes poor comprehenders to struggle with high-level interpretive processes needed to form a coherent discourse model remains uncertain despite years of study.
differences exist between good and poor comprehenders, which significantly impact their comprehension abilities.
the relationship between performance on complex span tasks and comprehension remains a mystery.
is this correlation due to weaknesses in word-level skills?
additionally, are the disparities in the capabilities of good and poor comprehenders related to their skill in creating efficient retrieval structures and storing them in long-term working memory (ltwm)?
the focus of this chapter is to reexamine the ongoing discussions in psycholinguistics regarding the uniqueness of figurative language usage.
it is proposed that figurative language does not represent a singular category of linguistic elements comprehended through distinctive figurative processes.
however, the ambiguous nature of various facets of figurative expression, often overlooked in numerous psycholinguistic investigations, presents significant questions concerning the potential balance between reducing cognitive strain and enhancing cognitive impacts in the comprehension of figurative language.
strategies for empirically examining this balance are proposed, which could serve as a foundation for forthcoming psycholinguistic inquiries into figurative language.
various types of figurative meanings exist, such as metaphoric, idiomatic, metonymic, ironic, satirical, proverbial, hyperbolic, and oxymoronic.
in the academic realm, scholars commonly argue that figurative language comprehension involves contrasting processes like literal vs.
however, considering the diversity of meanings, one might wonder whether numerous linguistic processes are at play or potentially could be when processing language.
psycholinguists have overlooked this question because of their narrow focus on one form of figurative meaning in contrast to a simplistic perception of literal meaning.
previously, scholars have erroneously made theoretical assertions about rapid processing transitioning from slower and consciously constructed interpretations and appreciations.
furthermore, psycholinguists have frequently overlooked the thorough examination of cognitive impacts or the outcomes of grasping figurative language.
in our opinion, understanding the trade-off between cognitive effort and effects in figurative language comprehension hinges on identifying the influencing constraints.
this involves empirically investigating how various factors exert individual effects and likely interact in intricate, possibly nonlinear, ways.
the cognitive effort invested in producing and understanding figurative language is influenced by the aims and inclinations of both speakers and listeners, while the cognitive effects in linguistic communication are shaped by factors such as the prevailing perspective, evaluation methods, and the nature of the materials employed.
by acknowledging and appreciating these factors, we aim to enrich endeavors aimed at gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between cognitive effort and effects in the use of figurative language.
the aim of this chapter is to offer an introduction and overview of the rapidly expanding literature concerning eye movements and their role in processing spoken language, with a particular focus on applications related to spoken language comprehension.
section 2 concentrates on methodological considerations.
just like any new approach, the enthusiasm for innovative discoveries and new areas of exploration needs to be balanced with a critical assessment of the paradigm itself, which includes task-specific strategies and the assumptions that connect the observed behaviors to the theoretical hypothesized underlying mechanisms.
key topics encompass the rationale linking eye movements to spoken language processing, the methods for collecting and interpreting eye movement data, practical examples showcasing certain paradigms and their comparisons to eye movement reading studies, as well as the respective experimental rationale.
moreover, discussions extend to the challenges and restrictions involved in investigating language within a limited visual context.
to address these matters, we examine findings from various visual world studies.
over the years, researchers have long utilized eye movements in reading to delve into various issues related to lexical and sentence processing.
now, these same issues are under scrutiny through the examination of eye movements in spoken language.
while certain differences exist between reading and spoken language due to inherent differences in the two modes of communication, scholars in psycholinguistics exploring topics like syntactic ambiguity resolution and reference resolution through eye movements in reading and spoken language believe they are examining theoretical propositions about these processes that go beyond input modality.
consequently, the psycholinguistic community will increasingly grapple with how to merge findings from visual world studies with those from reading eye movement studies, sometimes having to address conflicting results.
most research studies that analyze reading patterns by tracking eye movements typically focus on using eye movements as a way to measure cognitive processing load.
the main metric used is fixation duration.
the underlying theory suggests that reading becomes more challenging as fixation durations increase.
on the other hand, a significant number of visual world studies utilize eye movements as a tool to gauge representation.
the key parameter examined is the timing and placement of fixations as language is spoken.
a comparison between reading studies on resolving lexical and syntactic ambiguities and visual world studies tackling similar questions can highlight these contrasting approaches.
timing in eye-tracking reading becomes more complex when fixations are segmented into multiple word regions.
the challenges in interpreting reading time data emerge from the fact that the order of fixations may not align with the linear arrangement of words in the text.
this discrepancy is particularly pronounced when discussions about timing hinge on delineating text regions and categorizing fixations in a manner that divorces the measure from the initial exposure to the information.
while one might interpret the limited action options as indicative of effective problem-solving skills rather than being influenced by the actions and affordances as proposed by chambers et al., the experiment revealed contrasting outcomes for tasks involving instructions with indefinite articles, such as "pick up the cube.
now put it in a can." in such cases, participants became perplexed when the cube could only fit into one specific can.
this comparison between linguistic influences and problem-solving techniques is essential in assessing the influence of task presentation and requirements on strategies used.
a key caution for researchers utilizing the visual world paradigm for both production and comprehension is the importance of recognizing that while visual stimuli can help infer the listener's understanding, they also shape the context of the spoken language itself.
it is essential to acknowledge that the information presented visually influences processing, much like how linguistic cues in prior discourse impact reference resolution.
some argue that the effectiveness of the visual world paradigm hinges on gaze patterns to potential referents remaining unaffected by other visual stimuli.
however, this stance is comparable to the belief that eye fixations during reading only provide insights into word recognition and reference resolution when they are independent of contextual factors surrounding the fixated word.
this chapter has presented an overview of the expanding body of literature on eye movements and their role in processing spoken language, particularly emphasizing their applications in spoken language comprehension.
foundational studies have been examined, alongside discussions on data analysis and interpretation, as well as the challenges encountered when comparing eye-movement reading studies to visual world studies.
additionally, significant research avenues utilizing this methodology have been explored, with a focus on areas within language comprehension such as spoken word recognition, the utilization of referential cues in parsing, interactive conversation dynamics, and the progression of language processing skills in children.
this review makes it evident that the visual world paradigm is extensively used across various traditional areas of study within psycholinguistics.
the utilization of the visual world approach in these areas is prompting psycholinguists to delve into novel theoretical and empirical inquiries.
particularly in the realm of spoken sentence comprehension, emphasis has been placed on reference issues, partly due to the capability of the visual world methodology to link real-time reference resolution research with pragmatic and conversational studies.
in the domain of spoken word recognition, the temporally precise nature of this method has enabled researchers to scrutinize phonemic, sub-phonemic, and prosodic influences on word recognition in speech at a level of intricacy previously unattainable through conventional means.
it is anticipated that eye-movement measures will continue to gain traction and find increased utility within the psycholinguistics community, driven by these and other compelling reasons.
though psycholinguistic studies have typically viewed language as a cognitive ability, language usage research has concentrated on the interactive aspects of dialogue, sometimes neglecting the cognitive underpinnings of both speaking and comprehension.
this has led to the formulation of theories rooted in descriptive criteria rather than explanatory mechanisms.
encouragingly, these two approaches are now beginning to converge, suggesting the emergence of a comprehensive language processing theory that is both explanatory and cognitively sound, while also reflecting real-world applicability.
this chapter provides an overview of studies that establish the foundation for such a theory.
the full constraint model takes a rigorous approach to incorporating common ground in language processing, positioning itself at the far end of the range of available theories.
according to this model, common ground influences all aspects of language production and comprehension, with unrestricted access across all levels.
in this framework, common ground serves as an instant, mandatory, and comprehensive restriction on each level's functioning.
consequently, the model suggests that information within the speaker's or listener's knowledge but outside their shared common ground would not influence language processing.
the matcher subsequently transitioned to a director role for a different participant matcher, where the process was reiterated.
subsequently, the new matcher assumed a director position with a fresh participant.
interestingly, despite the lack of interaction between any participants in this subsequent exchange and the confederate who initially set the precedent terms, those terms were more prominent in this conversation compared to the alternate terms.
this suggests that speakers may not always apply precedents in a partner-specific way.
listeners might have perceived a shared understanding between the two speakers because they both opted for the same terms to refer to an unfamiliar concept.
to explore this, barr and keysar undertook an additional study where a speaker departed from the established pattern instead of adhering to it.
if patterns are tailored to each partner, breaking away from them should result in more confusion when done by the same person who set them compared to a different speaker.
the research by barr and keysar showed that there was a similar level of confusion when the pattern was disrupted by a new or familiar speaker.
therefore, it seems that listeners rely on patterns during speech processing not because of mutual understanding with the speaker but because they are readily accessible in their cognitive processes.
the findings on language comprehension convincingly dismiss the full constraint model as effects of private knowledge on comprehension have been consistently demonstrated across multiple studies from various research groups employing different tasks.
the ordinary memory view also fails to account for most of the results, as comprehenders seem to differentiate between private and shared information.
the majority of reviewed evidence supports either perspective adjustment or partial constraint.
notably, the literature lacks discussions on a dual process model for comprehension, which could offer an alternative explanation for the findings.
further detailed process-level inquiries are necessary to differentiate between these competing models.
the primary objective of language use research is to construct a theory that elucidates how individuals adjust their language patterns in response to the information requirements of others.
achieving this objective necessitates overcoming the intricate nature of language use, which is influenced by its cultural, interactional, and cognitive components.
despite substantial progress in research over recent years, comprehending the collaborative dynamics of conversations is a long-term endeavor that demands sustained cooperation among researchers in the decades ahead.
the second explanation for task-specific sentence and structure-specific deficits is based on the observation that syntactic structure influences not only the basic semantic values such as thematic roles but also higher-level discourse representations like focus and presuppositions.
although these discourse-level representations are not directly necessary for the tasks at hand, which mainly involve considering thematic roles and co-indexation, they can impact performance.
this phenomenon is well-documented in various implicit processes and may have differing effects across tasks.
for instance, passive and cleft-object sentences highlight the theme in the discourse focus.
a patient struggling to formulate an action when the focused element is the theme, yet capable of matching a focused theme to depictions of thematic roles, would encounter difficulties only with passive and cleft-object sentences during enactment.
according to this account, task-specific deficits in sentence or structure comprehension arise from the challenge of aligning the combined discourse and propositional meanings with the tasks.
confirmatory factor analyses indicated a preference for one-factor solutions over two-factor solutions.
the patient and control factor analyses of rt data showed similar structures.
introducing a factor structure based on sentence type groupings reflecting the varied syntactic structures in the stimuli did not explain more variance than the unconstrained analysis.
rotated factors yielded more factors, yet none aligned with the sentence type groupings tied to the varied syntactic structures in the stimuli.
conducting factor analyses on the screening tasks and syntactic tasks performed by the patients yielded distinct results in the unrotated factor analysis.
this analysis generated multiple factors, each corresponding to the performance on specific tasks.
it is yet to be established whether the diverse types of information thought to be integrated during comprehension would aggregate onto a single factor, akin to the various structures explored in the comprehension tasks, or onto distinct factors, resembling the different tasks employed.
in conclusion, we explore various shared issues at both the lexical and sentential levels of processing.
these encompass cognitive factors affecting l2 processing, the impact of cross-language similarity, the direction of cross-language influences, and the broader implications of bilingualism research for theories on word recognition, lexical access, and sentence processing.
while our analysis mainly centers on behavioral findings from studies involving second language learners and skilled bilingual individuals, we also address the growing body of research on the neurological underpinnings of bilingualism.
the researchers postulated that if vocabulary in the second language (l2) relied on the first language (l1) for processing, then translating into the l2 would be faster than naming pictures because the translation could be readily accessed without the need for conceptual interpretation.
picture naming was expected to be slower as it would involve interpreting the meaning and name of the image in l1 before retrieving the l2 name based on its association with the l1 translation.
conversely, if words in the l2 directly accessed their meanings, then all else being equal, naming pictures and translating into the l2 would take approximately the same duration.
potter and colleagues' findings supported the predictions regarding concept mediation.
the variance in the results observed in l2 learners can be linked to their proficiency level.
in the study conducted by potter et al., the participants were high school students who were preparing to embark on a summer immersion program in france.
despite not being fully fluent in french, these students were considered to be highly motivated learners who had likely progressed beyond the initial stages of language acquisition.
sign languages used by deaf individuals are naturally developing forms of communication with a rich linguistic complexity comparable to spoken languages.
even though the study of sign language psycholinguistics is still in its early stages, many fundamental concepts shaping our comprehension of speech perception and production, such as lexicality, frequency effects, semantic and form-based priming, categorical perception, production errors, and tip-of-the-finger experiences, are well-documented in sign languages.
moreover, neurolinguistic research has pinpointed crucial brain areas essential for sign language and has observed cases of sign aphasia leading to the loss of sign language abilities.
recent advancements in neuroimaging have further deepened our insight into the intricate neural mechanisms that support sign language usage.
collectively, these investigations offer a unique perspective on comprehending the general cognitive limitations evident in language processing and the biological foundations of human language.
one type of inflection that indicates a high level of intensity or vigor is characterized by a decreased extension of the elbow and a faster movement speed.
another inflection related to time conveys a repeated occurrence of the action over time and involves a circular motion passing near the chin in a continuous manner.
inflections for agreement in grammatical number can involve a series of repeated linear movements aimed at two or three points spaced evenly apart.
lastly, inflections related to grammatical verb agreement influence the initiation and conclusion of the movement path, indicating the subject and object of the sentences correspondingly.
syntax pertains to a language form that governs the relationships among words within a sentence.
in-depth analyses of syntax unveil both universal and language-specific patterns and limitations that significantly aid in comprehending sentence meanings, particularly in terms of defining thematic roles.
psychological studies on syntactic processing aim to decipher how these structured patterns are utilized during real-time sentence comprehension and how they interact with word meanings to form a conceptual understanding of the intended message.
furthermore, the expanding field of cognitive neuroscience is increasingly exploring the similarities and distinctions in the neural mechanisms underlying spoken and signed languages.
although some subtle differences have been identified in how they are processed, the prevailing evidence indicates a significant degree of similarity in how speech and sign languages are represented in the brain.
these findings suggest that fundamental elements are fundamental to the neural mechanisms for language, irrespective of the specific form of communication used.
future research will likely delve deeper into both the shared and unique features of these language forms, aiming to enhance our understanding of the cognitive processes that are influenced by the modality of language expression.
through these efforts, we may gain insights into the combined influences of biology and environment on human language communication.
this concept is evident in recent intriguing research on infant speech perception, early vocabulary acquisition, and the development of efficiency in comprehending spoken language, all of which will be discussed in the upcoming sections.
the purpose of this concise overview is to highlight some of the recent studies on language acquisition in infancy that embody this probabilistic viewpoint.
our aim is not to present a comprehensive analysis of this field or claim that this perspective provides all the solutions.
rather, we aim to elucidate recent research on how infants initially focus on speech sound patterns in their first year and progress to discerning meaning in speech by their second year.
by examining how babies, right from the start, pay attention to various cues in deciphering spoken language, this approach underscores the link between current psycholinguistic theories on language use and the evolving developmental outlook on language acquisition.
this concise overview of studies exploring how infants start to understand speech sounds during the initial two years of life has emphasized the new approaches in the field.
the ability of human infants to combine various probabilistic cues is noticeable throughout all stages of development.
initially, infants recognize patterns in sounds without meaning, then progress to grasping words and their significances, and eventually, they form intricate meanings by comprehending and employing words in context.
linguists didn't realize the connection between various linguistic phenomena until they began to consider both positive and negative data.
nativists propose that language-learners, who do not have access to a broad range of language data, must have an edge over linguists because they understand linguistic constraints before encountering the limited primary linguistic data available to them.
these discoveries present a dilemma for the experience-dependent theory.
according to this theory, children could potentially learn the rules governing negative polarity items, such as "any," based on statistical patterns in the language they are exposed to.
however, it would require high proficiency for children to accurately identify the specific linguistic contexts that permit the use of such items to prevent using them incorrectly.
the difficulty in understanding the inconsistency in interpreting disjunction and the difference in the interpretation of the universal quantifier "every" in restrictor versus scope is even more complex.
this challenge is centered on interpretation rather than the distribution of specific words in language.
the principle of semantic subsets dictates an arrangement of values for specific parameters in a way that a sentence is deemed true for a certain subset of circumstances compared to being true for another value.
children are compelled by this principle to initially adopt the subset value of the parameter as their interpretation, only abandoning it based on positive evidence found within the local language.
opting for the superset value would result in children producing sentences that are not part of the local language, posing a challenge for learning.
without negative evidence, it is hard to envision how children would eliminate language-incorrect sentence structures from their grammars.
to mitigate this issue, the semantic subset principle organizes parameter values accordingly.
speech is represented acoustically through continuous waves of acoustic energy.
this energy is visualized on a spectrogram, showing the frequency of acoustic energy over time.
an essential finding is that the gaps or pauses between words, syllables, or sounds within syllables are not visibly evident.
our ability to discern individual words and elements within them is attributed to our cognitive and perceptual capabilities, rather than being an inherent feature of the actual sound signal.
therefore, the predictors in the causal model for word-level reading in third grade consisted of first-grade assessments of three phonological components, vocabulary, and word-level reading.
the inclusion of the autoregressor aimed to eliminate any potential artificial causes of spurious causal effects.
it is plausible that the primary causal factor influencing third-grade word-level reading is the performance in word-level reading from first grade.
put differently, if a student excels in reading in first grade, they are likely to maintain their lead over classmates due to their initial advantage.
excluding the autoregressor of first-grade reading from the model may result in any variable correlated with the omitted first-grade reading measure showing a misleading causal impact.
how should these discoveries be classified?
none of the groups can be considered to be in a preliminary, optional stage of development, as the adult grammar permits optional usage.
the notably restricted usage observed in children with specific language impairment (sli) appears even less explicable from an optional stage perspective.
while these children may demonstrate significant underutilization of aspect morphemes, it is not due to them holding an assumption about optionality that fundamentally differs from that of other children.
this correlation between knowledge and processing could also offer a feasible rationale for the prolonged duration of the optional period observed in sli.
in cases where the processing constraints of children with sli are notable, these individuals may continue to generate less advanced structures even after the restriction is no longer applicable.
essentially, nonfinite syntactic structures that have been consistently accessed over time may still have sufficient activation to rival finite structures, even when the initial reason for their retrieval is no longer relevant.
the outcomes from this study not only back the concept of priming effects associated with processing demands but also provide additional support for a fundamental assumption of optional use approaches.
it is crucial to note that if the children were striving to accurately replicate the finite prime sentences but unintentionally omitted the auxiliary form, their prime sentence outputs would still have utilized the same finite syntactic structure required for the target sentence.
by activating the syntactic structure, it should have facilitated the retrieval of the matching structure for producing the target sentence, thus conserving more cognitive resources for the final step of recalling the necessary auxiliary verb.
nonetheless, this favorable impact was solely observed when the finite prime sentence was articulated with the auxiliary form.
this implies that prime sentence repetitions without the auxiliary form could have been endeavors to form non-finite sentences.
another potential way in which knowledge and processing factors could interact is by considering that the developmental milestones attributed to children in linguistic knowledge theories may demand more input evidence than commonly recognized.
in this perspective, knowledge is viewed not simply as biologically determined principles with minimal input requirements, but as a gradual accumulation of evidence from the input.
due to processing constraints affecting the way children with specific language impairment (sli) analyze input examples, their progress may lag behind that of their typically developing peers.
the disorders discussed in this section are not an exhaustive list of all possible causes of neurologic morbidity and mortality, nor are they necessarily the most prevalent.
we have specifically chosen a subset of cns disorders that are commonly diagnosed and treated by neurologists, and are recognized to have a significant impact on health outcomes.
we have not delved into other common and impactful conditions, such as chronic pain, mental retardation, peripheral neuropathies, or sleep disorders, as these often lack clear diagnostic criteria or are managed by specialists other than neurologists.
psychiatric disorders were considered beyond the scope of this discussion.
some disorders were excluded due to limited research, like muscular dystrophy.
conditions like cns neoplasms, which are extensively monitored, are covered in other resources.
noteworthy disorders like essential tremor, restless legs syndrome, and vascular dementia were not addressed here but could be explored in future assessments.
it may be beneficial to compare our findings with previous epidemiological reviews for further insights into similar conditions.
while stroke mortality rates have seen a decrease, our analysis in comparison to previous studies raises concerns about a potential rise in stroke incidence, despite research indicating a previous decline over many years.
this observed increase could be attributed to advancements in diagnostic techniques like neuroimaging and a rising number of elderly individuals in the community.
additionally, whereas the earlier study encompassed all forms of dementia, our current findings reveal significantly elevated rates of alzheimer's disease alone.
previous factors such as a growing elderly population and enhanced case identification may play a role, but the likelihood of a genuine surge in dementia cases necessitates further investigation.
limited class i evidence from the united states is typically found for most disorders.
high-quality data from non-us developed countries are often more abundant, possibly due to their centralized healthcare systems that enable better case identification and research.
it is advisable to cautiously extrapolate findings from one population to others, provided that demographic, cultural, and environmental factors are comparable.
nevertheless, variations in culture, age distribution, healthcare infrastructure, genetic predispositions, environmental influences, and socioeconomic factors across developed countries can impact the prevalence and diagnosis of the conditions under consideration.
the small size of nanoscale devices enables them to easily interact with biomolecules on both the cell surface and within the cell without altering their behavior and biochemical properties.
this accessibility to the inside of living cells presents exciting prospects for advancements in clinical and basic research.
by engaging with receptors, nucleic acids, transcription factors, and other signaling proteins at the molecular level, these devices can offer valuable insights into the intricate regulatory mechanisms, signaling networks, and transport processes that influence cell behavior under normal conditions and during pathological transformations.
remarriages and stepfamilies are on the rise, with significant societal implications.
key factors influencing further changes in families include declining fertility rates, longer life expectancies, and shifting attitudes towards marriage, cohabitation, and divorce.
in scenarios where families have only one child, future generations may lack siblings, cousins, aunts, and uncles.
with adults living up to 80 years and having children in their 20s to 30s, parents could have many years of life post-child-rearing, while their children may experience extended periods with elderly parents.
the impacts of increased gender equality in education, earnings, and societal rights on marriage, childbearing, and childrearing are complex and not yet fully realized.
initially, it was thought that the structure of dimers varied between cxc and cc chemokines, leading to the belief that they engage with receptors through different mechanisms.
further research revealed that the propensity to form dimers differs among chemokines, with certain ones like mcp-3 consistently existing as monomers.
dimerization occurs at substantially higher concentrations than needed for biological function.
it is now widely accepted that chemokines bind to their receptors in a one-to-one fashion.
a recent interesting study demonstrates frequent expression of cxcr4 and ccr7 in human breast cancer cell lines and breast tumor tissue.
the study reveals that the ligand for cxcr4, sdf-1, is predominantly produced in the lung, liver, and bone marrow, sites commonly associated with breast cancer metastasis.
in contrast, the ligand for ccr7, slc, is primarily found in lymph nodes, consistent with its role in lymphocyte homing.
the research also indicates that extracts from lung, liver, bone marrow, and lymph node tissues attract cells with cxcr4 receptors in laboratory settings, and that inhibiting cxcr4 significantly reduces metastasis in scid mice following the injection of breast cancer cell lines.
the findings on cxcr4 and sdf-1 suggest potential involvement of chemokines in tumor metastasis.
while it's unclear if ccr7 plays a similar role, it may attract tumor cells with this receptor to draining lymph nodes via slc and elc, which are present there.
the implications of ccr10, identified in malignant melanoma cell lines, remain speculative.
mastering the skill of effectively writing a coherent text is a challenging and extended process of cognitive advancement, markedly distinct from the acquisition of verbal communication.
typically, by the age of 5, oral language proficiency is well-established, encompassing a substantial vocabulary and the capacity to comprehend and construct grammatically correct sentences.
while the precise role of genetic predisposition in language acquisition remains uncertain, it is evident that speech development is an inherent aspect of early human growth.
conversely, literacy represents a purely cultural milestone, which individuals may not necessarily attain.
reading and writing involve the phonological speech mechanism to some extent, but also necessitate the acquisition of a distinct orthographic system.
the main objectives of this paper are twofold.
firstly, it aims to outline the developmental progression of writing skills across three distinct stages, from childhood through late adolescence to early adulthood.
the first two stages, namely knowledge-telling and knowledge-transforming, are extensively studied, while the third stage, knowledge crafting, though more hypothetical, holds significance in grasping advanced levels of writing proficiency.
secondly, the paper proposes that the primary obstacle in advancing through these stages lies in the limited capacity of the central executive in working memory.
this executive function needs to focus not only on language production but also on planning, reviewing, and coordinating ideas, all while juggling multiple text representations in working memory.
attaining the required cognitive control necessitates minimizing the central executive's workload.
finally, the paper will explore the implications of these insights for the field of writing education.
the process of demand reduction is believed to involve acquiring domain-specific knowledge which can be quickly accessed from long-term memory instead of relying on short-term working memory, and partially automating fundamental writing tasks.
these reductions can be most effectively accomplished through cognitive apprenticeship training methods, especially emphasizing deliberate practice.
additionally, there are two seemingly paradoxical phenomena to consider in older, professional writers: early literary prowess and a decline in working memory.
these aspects are examined before wrapping up the paper.
the purpose of the three stages depicted in figure 1 is to outline three broad phases of writing development.
the graph illustrates how writing proficiency improves steadily with practice, mirroring the progression seen in perceptual-motor and cognitive skills.
the specific incremental changes that facilitate the transition to the next developmental stage are not discussed in this article.
however, it is generally believed that fundamental writing processes such as planning, language generation, and reviewing, along with the mental frameworks required in working memory, undergo ongoing refinements through both natural maturation and educational experiences within specific writing contexts.
due to the influence of task-specific factors, a child might operate at a more advanced level in narrative writing, for example, if it is a more frequently practiced form compared to persuasive writing.
as depicted in figure 1, during the knowledge-telling stage, the author's representation takes precedence.
moving on to the knowledge-transforming stage, the text's representation becomes detailed and stable enough to sustain in working memory.
at this point, the reader's representation is not typically engaged in working memory until the knowledge-crafting stage, where it needs to be sufficiently developed and steady to be retained.
the availability of resources in working memory is essential to coordinate all three representations.
this emphasizes the significant strain on working memory due to the demands of planning, sentence construction, and reviewing processes.
these demands not only affect the coordination of fundamental cognitive processes but also impact the retention and utilization of the three diverse representations involved in the composition of expert writers.
among a group of 34 students, up to 50% provided feedback on modifications that enhanced coherence, included additional content, reduced redundancies, and enhanced overall quality.
however, it is posited that constraints in working memory, which involve retaining and manipulating the reader's understanding of the text while also handling the author's intent and text components, significantly hinder the writing proficiency of developing writers from childhood through young adulthood.
this limitation can elucidate why adolescent writers typically do not naturally and consistently engage in the intricate structural revisions commonly observed in proficient adult writers.
however, being conscious of a hypothetical reader when creating text differs from the ability to read the text from someone else's viewpoint as it is currently written.
while understanding the audience is crucial, it is only one part of the process needed to eventually interpret the author's text from the perspective of an imagined reader.
another critical factor is possessing a well-developed working memory system that can effectively manage the author, text, and reader representations simultaneously and effortlessly.
specifically, executive attention must be fully mature and efficiently utilized to juggle these representations as the writer drafts, refines, and assesses the evolving text.
in the art of crafting knowledge, the reader's understanding of the text influences how the author perceives the text and the intended message.
ultimately, knowledge-crafting involves a dynamic interplay among the representations housed in working memory.
a skilled and experienced writer working on refining their craft must possess the ability to juggle and manipulate various elements in their mind, such as the original author's concepts, the text itself, and the anticipated reader's understanding of the text.
the processes of both honing knowledge and the transitional phase of transforming knowledge require the skill of orchestrating intricate interactions that involve planning ideas, text creation, and reviewing both ideas and text.
the primary challenge in progressing from simply conveying information to crafting knowledge lies in the limitations of the central executive function of working memory.
while writers may possess substantial knowledge, effectively utilizing it necessitates the simultaneous retention of multiple representations in working memory and the skillful coordination of the writing process.
it is insufficient for a writer to only excel in planning or producing coherent sentences; they must also seamlessly blend planning and execution in a manner that mirrors established writers.
furthermore, these fundamental processes of composition must be adeptly managed.
considering the points discussed, two seemingly contradictory facts about the progression of writing skills over a lifetime emerge.
to illustrate this, it is beneficial to outline the key idea of the paper.
advancing writing abilities entail a gradual process of knowledge-telling, knowledge-transforming, and knowledge-crafting over several decades.
engaging in complex written composition tasks tests language, memory, and cognitive abilities simultaneously.
the pinnacle of expertise, typically reached at the professional level, necessitates the proficient handling of various representations in working memory and the harmonization of multiple writing processes.
both processes of transforming knowledge and, in particular, crafting knowledge require a significant amount of working memory resources.
specifically, executive attention is necessary for self-regulation, a process that likely depends on proper maturation, learning specific to a given domain, and sufficient training.
it is unreasonable to anticipate a 5-year-old to write at a college level since the development of the frontal lobes, which support executive functions, has not yet reached maturity.
additionally, considering that working memory tends to decrease as individuals age, one could also anticipate a decline in writing proficiency among older adults.
this book aims to present modern literary theory in a way that is clear and engaging for a broad audience.
since its first publication in 1983, it has been gratifying to observe that not only literary critics, but also lawyers, anthropologists, and cultural theorists have studied its content.
the book argues that there is no singular 'literary theory' that applies exclusively to literature, as the various approaches discussed, such as phenomenology, semiotics, structuralism, and psychoanalysis, originated from different fields in the humanities and extend well beyond literature.
this interdisciplinary nature may explain the book's appeal and the decision to release a new edition.
additionally, the author notes with surprise the interest shown by readers outside academic circles.
in contrast to typical academic works, this particular piece has transcended its scholarly boundaries to attract a wider readership, defying the perceived exclusivity often associated with literary theory.
despite its potentially complex and specialized language, it manages to captivate individuals outside traditional academic circles.
this indicates that even those unfamiliar with university settings are intrigued by its content.
consequently, those within academia who dismiss it as too obscure should reconsider their stance.
it is heartening to see that in a contemporary era that craves instant understanding of everything, there are individuals willing to invest effort in understanding new ways of discussing literature.
the notion within literary studies that certain works of literature can only be enjoyed by individuals with a specific cultural background is considered truly elitist.
some believe that there are individuals inherently possessing "literary values," while others are left in the outskirts.
the surge of literary theory since the 1960s stemmed from challenging this belief due to the influx of students from diverse cultural backgrounds entering higher education.
literary theory aimed to liberate literary works from a restricted "cultivated sensibility," making them accessible to a broader audience for analysis.
critiques about the complexity of literary theory are akin to not expecting immediate comprehension of biology or chemical engineering textbooks.
literature studies are often perceived differently as we anticipate literature to use a straightforward language accessible to everyone, reflecting a particular 'theory' of literature.
the transformation that has significantly impacted literary theory in the 21st century can be traced back to around 1917, marked by the publication of the influential essay 'art as device' by the young russian formalist viktor shklovsky.
since then, literary theory has undergone a remarkable expansion, particularly in the last two decades, leading to profound changes in the understanding of concepts like 'literature', 'reading', and 'criticism'.
however, much of this theoretical revolution remains confined to a niche audience of experts and avid supporters, yet to make a substantial impact on students of literature and the general readership.
the straightforward explanation here is that lacking any form of theory, even if it is unexamined and implied, we would be unable to understand the concept of a 'literary work' or comprehend how to interpret it.
displaying animosity towards theory typically signifies a resistance to theories proposed by others while disregarding one's own.
this book aims to dismantle such resistance and help us recollect and acknowledge the significance of theory.
gibbon believed he was depicting historical accuracy, similarly to the authors of genesis; however, some now interpret their works as either 'fact' or 'fiction'.
newman was convinced of the truthfulness of his theological reflections, which are now perceived by many as 'literature'.
furthermore, while 'literature' encompasses certain 'factual' texts, it excludes various fictional works like superman comics and mills and boon novels, which are not typically classified as literature or literature.
the question arises whether categorizing something as 'literature' suggests that disciplines such as history, philosophy, and natural science lack creativity and imagination.
the formalists initially viewed literary works as arbitrary collections of 'devices' before recognizing these devices as interconnected elements or 'functions' within a comprehensive textual framework.
these 'devices' encompassed sound, imagery, rhythm, syntax, meter, rhyme, narrative techniques, and other formal literary components.
the common denominator among these elements was their ability to create an 'estranging' or 'defamiliarizing' impact.
what set literary language apart and differentiated it from other forms of communication was its ability to distort ordinary language in various ways.
by subjecting ordinary language to the influence of literary devices, it was intensified, condensed, contorted, compressed, elongated, and inverted.
this manipulation rendered language 'strange,' leading to a sudden unfamiliarity in the everyday world.
everyday speech patterns tend to dull our perceptions and reactions to reality, a phenomenon the formalists described as becoming 'automatized.' through its ability to prompt a heightened awareness of language, literature challenges these ingrained responses, making objects more 'perceivable.' literary discourse may seem distant from everyday speech, yet it paradoxically immerses us more deeply into our experiences.
just as we often inhale air without awareness, language serves as an ever-present conduit.
however, when the air becomes dense or contaminated, we are compelled to focus on our breathing, heightening our bodily sensations.
similarly, we typically glance over a friend's hastily written note without dissecting its structure.
but if a narrative abruptly pauses, shifts between levels, and prolongs its climax, our awareness of its construction increases, intensifying our connection.
according to the formalists, such narratives employ hindrances to sustain interest, revealing the intricate artistry of literary language.
the formalists viewed literary language as a collection of deviations from a standard, a form of linguistic rebellion: literature represents a distinctive type of language, contrasting with the common language we typically use.
the ability to recognize a deviation necessitates the identification of the standard it diverges from.
while 'ordinary language' is admired by certain oxford philosophers, the everyday language spoken by oxford philosophers differs significantly from that of glaswegian dockers.
the language employed by these social groups when composing love letters is often distinct from their interactions with the local priest.
the belief in a singular 'normal' language, a universal form of communication shared uniformly among all members of society, is a misconception.
any real language comprises a diverse range of discourses, varying based on factors like class, region, gender, and status, and cannot be neatly enclosed within a single cohesive linguistic community.
what one person considers normal may be seen as a deviation by another: the use of 'ginnel' instead of 'alleyway' might be deemed poetic in brighton but commonplace in barnsley.
the russian formalists were aware of these dynamics.
they understood that norms and deviations could vary across different social or historical settings, highlighting that the concept of 'poetry' is relative to one's perspective.
they acknowledged that the quality of being 'estranging' in language was contextual, as it only appeared so in comparison to a specific linguistic standard.
if this standard changed, the written work might lose its literary essence.
the formalists believed that 'literariness' depended on the contrast between different types of discourse rather than being an inherent trait.
their focus was not on defining 'literature' but on 'literariness,' which encompassed unique uses of language present not only in literary works but also in various other contexts.
nonetheless, the formalists continued to believe that the core of literature lay in the concept of 'defamiliarization'.
they acknowledged this linguistic technique as a means of contrasting different forms of speech.
for instance, consider the phrase "this is aw fully squiggly handwriting!" overheard at a nearby pub table.
is this considered literary or non-literary language?
surprisingly, it falls within the realm of the literary, taken from knut hamsun's novel hunger.
however, what distinguishes it as literary?
notably, it does not draw explicit attention to itself as a linguistic performance.
the reasoning behind recognizing it as literary lies in its origins in hamsun's novel, a work classified as 'fiction', typically included in academic literature curricula.
a challenge within the concept of 'estrangement' lies in the fact that through clever interpretation, any form of writing can be viewed as unfamiliar.
take, for instance, a mundane and seemingly clear directive often spotted in the london underground stating: 'dogs must be carried on the escalator.' upon closer inspection, the statement's ambiguity surfaces: does it mean the obligation to carry a dog while using the escalator?
could one be prohibited from using the escalator without grasping a random dog during the ascent?
numerous seemingly straightforward notifications include similar uncertainties, such as 'refuse to be put in this basket,' or the british road marker 'way out' interpreted by a californian.
setting aside these perplexing ambiguities, it is evident that the underground sign could be appreciated as a form of literature.
one might be arrested by the abrupt, menacing rhythm of the initial weighty one-syllable words, allowing their mind to wander to the subtle connotations of 'carried' by the time it is mentioned, evoking imagery of aiding those in need.
they might even perceive in the cadence and emphasis of the term 'escalator' a reflection of the mechanical, oscillating motion of the apparatus itself.
while this pursuit may seem futile, it is no more so than interpreting the clash of swords in a poetic depiction of a duel and, importantly, it hints that 'literature' is as much about readers' interactions with the text as it is about the impact of the text on them.
he discusses women and love in a broader sense.
literature, unlike textbooks or daily notes, can be seen as a form of communication that doesn't have an immediate practical use but rather reflects a general understanding of things.
at times, it may use unique language to emphasize that it is discussing a concept of talking about women in general rather than specific individuals.
this emphasis on the language itself, rather than the actual subject matter, can suggest that literature is a form of self-referential language, where it discusses itself.
however, there are drawbacks to defining literature in this manner as well.
for instance, george orwell would likely have been surprised to discover that his essays were expected to be interpreted based on how he wrote about the subjects, rather than the subjects themselves.
in many works considered literature, the truthfulness and practical significance of the content are seen as crucial to the overall impact.
even if regarding discourse in a "non-pragmatic" manner is a component of what constitutes "literature," it implies that literature cannot be objectively defined.
this perspective suggests that how literature is defined depends on the reader's interpretation rather than the inherent nature of the text.
while certain forms of writing such as poems, plays, and novels are evidently crafted to be "non-pragmatic" in this sense, it does not assure that they will always be interpreted in that manner.
i might choose to read gibbon's account of the roman empire not because i expect it to provide accurate information about ancient rome but because i appreciate gibbon's writing style or am drawn to depictions of human corruption from any historical context.
on the other hand, i might be interested in reading robert burns's poem out of curiosity as a japanese horticulturalist, as i am unsure about whether the red rose thrived in eighteenth-century britain.
some may argue that this isn't a literary analysis, yet should i only consider reading orwell's essays as literature if i interpret his views on the spanish civil war to reflect profound truths about human existence?
while many works traditionally studied as literature in educational settings were deliberately crafted for literary consumption, numerous pieces evolved from historical or philosophical origins to become literary classics, or vice versa, appreciated for their historical significance.
in this context, literature is perceived not as an inherent quality or specific characteristics found in certain works ranging from beowulf to virginia woolf, but rather as a variety of ways individuals engage with writing.
identifying a constant set of inherent features in all that falls under the term 'literature' is challenging, similar to pinpointing a single shared characteristic among all games.
the concept of an 'essence' of literature does not exist.
any piece of writing can be approached in a 'non-pragmatic' manner, if that is the essence of reading a text as literature, just as any writing can be read 'poetically'.
for instance, when examining a railway timetable not to plan a journey but to trigger contemplation about the rapid pace and intricate nature of modern life, one could be said to be reading it as literature.
ellis suggests that the term 'literature' functions similarly to the word 'weed': weeds are not specific types of plants but rather any plant unwanted by a gardener.
he speculates that 'literature' could be understood as the opposite – any writing highly valued by someone for various reasons.
according to ellis, 'literature' and 'weed' are functional terms, not indicating fixed essences of things but rather how they are perceived and interact within a social context.
they describe the roles, relationships, behavior, and uses of texts or plants, and the human activities connected to them.
therefore, the definition of 'literature' is seen as purely formal and essentially empty.
even if seen as a non-pragmatic linguistic concept, defining 'literature' does not reveal its core essence, similarly to other language practices like jokes.
it is not clear-cut whether we can make a clear distinction between 'practical' and 'non-practical' ways of engaging with language.
while reading a novel for enjoyment is obviously distinct from reading a road sign for essential information, what about reading a biology textbook to enhance knowledge?
should this be considered a 'pragmatic' approach to language?
in various cultures, 'literature' has fulfilled practical roles, including religious ones; making a definitive separation between 'practical' and 'non-practical' may only be feasible in societies like ours, where literature has lost much of its practical value.
the definition we might be proposing for the 'literary' could actually be context-specific and tied to a particular historical period.
perhaps the simplest explanation is that the first three examples are considered instances of 'good writing', while the last three are not.
despite this being somewhat inaccurate in my opinion, it does hint that people generally label writing as 'literature' if they perceive it as high quality.
a valid counterargument is that if this were entirely true, the concept of 'bad literature' would not exist.
personally, i may find lamb and macaulay to be overrated, but that does not negate their classification as literature.
you might view raymond chandler as 'good within a specific genre', but not necessarily as literature.
conversely, if macaulay were an exceptionally poor writer with no grasp of grammar and a sole focus on white mice, his work might not be deemed literature at all, not even of a low quality.
value judgments play a significant role in determining what is considered literature and what is not.
it's not just about writing being exceptional to be classified as literary, but rather being the type that is perceived as exceptional; it could be a subpar instance of a commonly esteemed style.
while no one would label a bus ticket as inferior literature, it wouldn't be uncommon to critique the poetry of ernest dowson as such.
the term "fine writing" or belles lettres is ambiguous in this context, referring to writing that is typically held in high esteem without necessarily implying that a specific example of it is objectively "good".
the idea put forth by this reservation asserts that 'literature' is a highly revered form of writing, shedding light on the subject.
however, it brings about a significant consequence.
it suggests that the notion of 'literature' being 'objective' in a timeless and unchangeable way is erroneous.
essentially, anything has the potential to be considered literature, and even works that are traditionally seen as unquestionably literary, such as shakespeare, can lose their status as literature.
the belief that the study of literature involves exploring a fixed and clearly defined entity, akin to entomology's study of insects, is a misconception.
certain types of fiction qualify as literature while others do not; there is literature that is fictional and literature that is not; some literature is introspective in its language use, whereas some eloquent rhetoric does not fall under the category of literature.
therefore, the concept of literature as a collection of works with guaranteed and unchanging value, characterized by specific inherent qualities, is unfounded.
just as people may reinterpret a piece of work as philosophy in one era and as literature in the subsequent era, or vice versa, they are also prone to reconsidering the value they attribute to certain writings.
they might even reassess the criteria they apply in determining what is deemed valuable and what is not.
this shift in perspective, as hinted earlier, does not necessarily entail them categorically denying a work the status of literature if they now view it as subpar; they may still classify it as literature, signifying that it fits within the realm of writing they typically appreciate.
nonetheless, it does underscore the notion that the established 'literary canon', the revered 'great tradition' of 'national literature', ought to be acknowledged as a construct, devised by specific individuals for specific motives during a specific period.
there is no inherent value in a literary work or tradition independent of the context in which it is valued.
the concept of 'value' is subjective, determined by individuals, circumstances, specific criteria, and goals.
it is conceivable that a future society, shaped by significant historical changes, may no longer derive any meaning from shakespeare's writings.
his works could be perceived as incomprehensible, embodying perspectives and emotions irrelevant to such a society.
thus, shakespeare could lose his significance and be no more esteemed than contemporary graffiti.
while many might view this societal shift as a tragic loss, it would be narrow-minded not to consider that it could result from a broader human evolution.
karl marx delved into the perplexity of why ancient greek art maintained an enduring appeal, despite the societal circumstances that birthed it having long faded.
the uncertainty arises as history continues, and the final chapter remains unwritten.
suppose through meticulous archaeologi cal research, we uncovered more about the original intentions of ancient greek tragedy for its audiences.
upon realizing the vast disparity between their concerns and ours, we might approach the plays with fresh insight.
it is plausible that this newfound understanding could alter our appreciation, leading us to the realization that our past enjoyment stemmed from viewing them through our contemporary lens.
as this connection diminishes, the resonance of the drama may wane, failing to captivate us any longer.
the homer and shakespeare we associate with today are distinct from those of previous eras.
throughout history, different societies have interpreted and reinterpreted their works, assigning different values to various elements.
essentially, all literary pieces undergo a continual process of reinterpretation by the communities that engage with them, whether consciously or not.
therefore, any attempt to introduce a work to new audiences inevitably results in significant alterations, highlighting the fluid and evolving nature of literature and its appreciation.
i do not suggest that instability arises solely from the subjective nature of value judgments.
this perspective posits a clear distinction between objective facts, such as landmarks like grand central station, and subjective value judgments, like preferring bananas or perceiving the shift in tone from defensive assertiveness to grim resilience in a yeats poem.
while facts are deemed universally valid, values are seen as personal and discretionary.
it is understandable to differentiate between stating a fact, like "this cathedral was constructed in 1612," and expressing a value judgment, such as "this cathedral exemplifies magnificent baroque architecture." however, imagine if i were guiding a foreign visitor around england and constantly provided the first type of information, it might perplex her.
she may inquire why i emphasize the origins of these structures and question the focus on historical dates.
in her society, she may explain, buildings are categorized by their orientation towards specific cardinal directions without attaching significance to historical foundations.
in this context, it is impossible to make a completely unbiased statement.
for instance, disclosing the construction date of a cathedral is generally viewed as more impartial in our society than expressing an opinion about its design.
however, it is conceivable that there could be situations where the mention of the construction date is perceived as more influenced by personal beliefs compared to discussing the architecture.
the words 'baroque' and 'magnificent' may now be closely linked in meaning, while only a few of us maintain the importance of the founding date of a building.
therefore, my statement might be interpreted as subtly expressing this bias.
all our descriptive statements are influenced by underlying value judgments, and without such frameworks, we would struggle to communicate effectively with one another.
the preference for bananas can appear as a personal preference, yet its significance is debatable.
upon close examination of my food preferences, they may uncover strong connections to formative experiences in early childhood, relationships with family members, and various cultural influences as significant as societal norms.
this assertion is particularly valid concerning the foundational beliefs and values inherent in the society i am part of, such as the importance of maintaining good health, the biological roots of gender differences, and the inherent value of human life over animals like crocodiles.
while disagreements may arise, they stem from shared fundamental perspectives intertwined with our social environment that, if altered, would require a complete transformation of our way of life.
viewing literature merely as an 'objective' descriptive category is inadequate, just as it is insufficient to regard literature as a mere designation based on whims.
the value judgments regarding literature are not arbitrary but rooted in fundamental belief systems akin to the sturdy foundation of the empire state building.
therefore, it is evident that literature is not a tangible entity like insects, and the ever-changing value judgments shaping it are closely linked to societal ideologies.
ultimately, these judgments are not solely about personal preferences but are deeply intertwined with the power dynamics of different social groups.
to validate this assertion, one can examine the historical emergence of 'literature' in england.
in the 18th century in england, the notion of literature was not limited, as it sometimes is today, to just 'creative' or 'imaginative' writing.
it encompassed the entirety of esteemed writing in society, including philosophy, history, essays, letters, and poetry.
a text was considered 'literary' based not on whether it was fictional – as there was uncertainty during that era regarding whether novels were even literature – but on whether it adhered to specific standards of 'polite letters'.
essentially, the criteria for what constituted literature were openly ideological: writing that reflected the values and 'tastes' of a specific social class qualified as literature, while items like street ballads, popular romances, and even drama did not.
therefore, at that time in history, the inherent bias in the concept of literature was quite evident.
the distinction between 'factual' and 'imaginative' writing had been long acknowledged.
the term 'poetry' or 'poesy' historically denoted fiction, championed notably by philip sidney in his apology for poetry.
however, during the romantic era, literature started to be closely associated with the 'imaginative', where writing about non-existent entities took precedence over documenting factual realities such as birmingham or physiological processes.
the word 'imaginative' embodies a dual meaning reflective of this shift: while carrying connotations of 'imaginary' as in 'literally untrue', it also signifies an esteemed quality of being 'visionary' or 'inventive'.
as contemporary individuals influenced by the romantic era rather than positioned after it, we find it challenging to fully comprehend the distinctiveness of this historically specific notion.
most english writers of the time would likely have considered it strange that we now exalt their 'imaginative vision' while belittling those who focus on topics like the black death or the warsaw ghetto as merely 'prosaic'.
it was during the romantic era that the term 'prosaic' started to take on a negative connotation, implying something mundane, uninspiring, and lacking in poetic flare.
the preference for what is nonexistent over what actually exists, the elevation of poetry and imagination above prose and factual accounts, reflects a deeper societal characteristic of the romantic period.
however, the idealistic aspirations and vibrant energies unleashed by these revolutions, energies that breathe life into romantic literature, come into a potentially tragic conflict with the harsh realities of the emerging bourgeois governments.
in england, a crudely materialistic utilitarianism is swiftly gaining ground as the primary ideology of the industrial middle class, objectifying facts, simplifying human interactions to monetary transactions, and disregarding art as non-lucrative decoration.
the indifferent practices of early industrial capitalism displace entire communities, reduce human existence to labor-for-wage, impose a dissociating work process on the newly established working class, and fail to grasp anything that cannot be commodified in the marketplace.
in the face of formidable challenges, the emphasis placed by the romantics on the 'creative imagination' is not mere daydreaming but holds significant importance.
it suggests that 'literature' stands out as a rare refuge where the creative principles marginalized by industrial capitalism in english society can find appreciation and validation.
this notion of 'imaginative creation' offers a counterbalance to the alienated nature of labor imposed by capitalism; the intuitive and transcendent qualities of the poetic mind serve as a dynamic critique of rationalist and empiricist ideologies fixated solely on 'fact.' the literary work itself emerges as a mysterious and cohesive entity, in opposition to the fragmented individualism of the capitalist market - described as 'spontaneous' versus calculated, and creative instead of mechanical.
therefore, the term 'poetry' encompasses more than a writing technique; it carries profound social, political, and philosophical connotations that might provoke a drastic reaction from the ruling class.
the imaginative quality referred to as 'transcendental' not only posed a challenge to weak rationalism but also provided writers with a reassuringly absolute alternative to history itself.
this detachment from history was an accurate depiction of the situation experienced by romantic writers.
in a time where art was transitioning into a mere commodity and romantic artists were seen as little more than minor producers of goods, their claims to represent humanity and proclaim eternal truths felt increasingly detached from reality.
despite their fervent idealism, romantics found themselves on the fringes of a society that did not value their prophetic voices.
consequently, the impassioned ideals of the romantics took on a more philosophical, rather than pragmatic, nature.
without a significant role in the social changes needed to transform industrial capitalism into a fairer system, writers retreated into the solitude of their own creative minds.
the era under discussion witnessed the emergence of modern 'aesthetics', or the philosophy of art, through the works of influential figures like kant, hegel, schiller, coleridge, and others.
it is from this period that many contemporary concepts such as the 'symbol', 'aesthetic experience', 'aesthetic harmony', and the distinctiveness of art pieces originate.
in the past, people engaged in creating and interacting with artistic forms for various reasons; however, these practices were now being encompassed under a concept known as the 'aesthetic', giving rise to a new wave of aestheticians aiming to reveal its fundamental structures.
although questions regarding art had been posed earlier, they started to hold a renewed significance during this time.
the essence of social progress lay in nurturing the dynamic and spontaneous energies, yet tempering them with the limitations imposed by a structured social order to prevent chaotic outcomes.
representing a blend of motion and stability, chaos and order, and the interaction between the mind and the physical world, the symbol embodied an absolute spiritual truth.
this truth was not arrived at through analytical reasoning but was grasped intuitively.
the symbol conveyed truths in a way that demanded acceptance without room for questioning – it was either understood or not.
it stood as a central element of an irrational stance that forestalled logical analysis, a trend that has persisted in literary theory.
the unity of the symbol was sacrosanct, discouraging dissection or deconstruction akin to analyzing the holy trinity.
the growth of english studies in the later nineteenth century can be attributed, in part, to the decline of religion.
by the mid-victorian era, religion, a once powerful and steadfast ideological force, was losing its influence over the masses due to the challenges posed by scientific advancements and societal changes.
the victorian ruling class, in particular, was concerned about this shift as religion had been a highly effective tool for ideological control, relying on symbols, rituals, and mythology rather than explicit doctrines to shape beliefs.
eliot recognized that successful ideologies tap into deep-seated emotional and experiential aspects of human nature, and any ideology unable to connect with these primal needs is unlikely to endure.
religion has the ability to function effectively across various social strata.
it can cater to the intellectual elite through doctrinal interpretations and also offer a more spiritual approach for the common people.
acting as a cohesive force in society, it brings together devout peasants, progressive middle-class individuals, and theological intellectuals within the same structure.
its strength lies in translating beliefs into actions: religion involves communal rituals like sharing the chalice and giving thanks for the harvest, rather than engaging solely in abstract theological debates.
the enduring truths it conveys, akin to literary symbols, are beyond rational proof, which makes them appear absolute, especially during the victorian era.
additionally, religion, in its diverse forms, promotes peace by encouraging humility, selflessness, and inner reflection.
it's not surprising that the victorian ruling class viewed any potential breakdown of this ideological narrative with concern.
with the decline of religion in fulfilling the role of providing societal cohesion, emotional values, and foundational myths in a socially tumultuous class-based society, the idea of 'englishness' emerged as a means to carry this ideological weight starting from the victorian era.
matthew arnold emerges as a central figure in this narrative, renowned for his acute awareness of his social class's needs and his open acknowledgment of it.
arnold identifies the pressing necessity to 'hellenize' or refine the philistine middle class, who have struggled to bolster their political and economic influence with a nuanced ideology.
he proposes infusing elements of the traditional aristocratic style into this group to compensate for their inadequacies, recognizing that the aristocracy, although no longer the leading class in england, possess the ideological resources to support their middle-class superiors.
arnold is refreshingly sincere: he does not pretend that educating the working class is solely for their own good, or that his interest in their spiritual welfare is purely altruistic.
in line with this viewpoint, a supporter in the twentieth century straightforwardly stated: 'if working-class children are deprived of access to cultural experiences, they may evolve into individuals who later demand material equality.' without exposing the masses to literature, they might resort to activism.
literature, with its liberal and 'humanizing' nature, was considered an ideal vehicle for countering political bigotry and extremism.
by focusing on universal human values rather than specific historical events like civil conflicts or societal injustices, literature was believed to offer a broader perspective that transcended the mundane concerns of everyday life.
advocates saw literature as a means to cultivate empathy and understanding across social classes, creating a serene space for collective contemplation of eternal truths and beauty.
in the eyes of victorian educators, english literature was instrumental in fostering compassion and unity among individuals, providing a sanctuary from the chaos and challenges of daily existence.
it would aim to introduce to them the moral values of bourgeois civilization, instill in them a respect for middle-class accomplishments, and, as reading is a fundamentally personal and contemplative pursuit, help restrain any inclination towards collective political endeavors.
additionally, it would foster a sense of pride in their native language and literature.
despite limited education and extensive work hours hindering them from creating a literary masterpiece themselves, they could derive satisfaction from knowing that others like them, such as english people, had achieved such feats.
according to a literary analysis from 1891, the populace requires political education to understand their role in society and as citizens, and they also benefit emotionally from learning about heroic and patriotic figures through captivating legends and historical accounts.
arnold held his own beliefs, viewing them as rational viewpoints rather than rigid doctrines, like the majority.
he believed literature should not directly express these beliefs or openly advocate, for instance, that private property safeguards freedom.
instead, its role was to impart timeless truths, diverting people from immediate concerns, fostering tolerance and generosity, thus safeguarding private property.
much like arnold aimed to dissolve the dogmatic aspects of christianity through poetic language in his works such as literature and dogma and god and the bible, literature was to sweeten middle-class ideology with its artistic appeal.
leavis are significant proponents in literary criticism.
instead of viewing morality as a predefined set of rules or an explicit ethical framework, it is now regarded as a profound concern for the overall quality of life, focusing on the subtle nuances and complexities of human experiences.
this view suggests that traditional religious doctrines have weakened and that conveying moral values through dramatic representation rather than complex theories is necessary.
literature, being a vivid portrayal of such values, brings moral lessons to life, making them feel as real as a physical impact.
literature transcends its traditional role as a mere supporter of moral principles to become the moral compass of the contemporary era, a concept that f.
leavis exemplified vividly in his work.
english literature in victorian society was not solely directed at the working class as a form of oppression.
according to a witness from the royal commission in 1877, english was suggested as a suitable subject for women and men seen as less competent who pursued teaching roles.
the terms 'softening' and 'humanizing' associated with english education, commonly used by its early proponents, were perceived as distinctly feminine within gender stereotypes at that time.
the increasing popularity of english studies coincided with the slow acceptance of women into higher education institutions.
as english was viewed as less taxing and focused on emotions rather than traditional academic disciplines typically seen as masculine, it became an easy subject to offer to women who were often barred from studies in science and the professions.
notably, sir arthur quiller couch, the first professor of english at cambridge university, would start his lectures with 'gentlemen' even though his audience mainly comprised women.
english, which was considered a suitable subject for women, workers, and those looking to impress the locals, faced challenges when trying to establish itself in the prestigious academic circles of oxford and cambridge.
viewed as lesser compared to disciplines like greats or philology, english was seen as amateurish and lacking in scholarly rigor.
the traditional perception was that english gentlemen already read literature in their leisure time, making formal study seemingly unnecessary.
both universities resisted the inclusion of english as a serious academic pursuit, as it was perceived as mere chit-chat about literary taste rather than a subject worthy of systematic examination.
over time, however, these objections were overcome, and english has become a fully recognized and respected field of study.
early critics like the esteemed oxford professor sir walter raleigh expressed disdain for the subject, highlighting the challenges english initially faced as it sought academic legitimacy.
english appeared to have a chance of proving its worth in the ancient universities only by consistently attempting to emulate the classics.
however, the scholars of the classics showed little enthusiasm for having this sad imitation of their discipline present.
the england's victory over germany signified a resurgence of national pride and patriotism, contributing positively to the english cause.
however, the profound impact of the war, with its relentless scrutiny of long-held cultural beliefs, led to a sense of spiritual yearning.
one contemporary observer referred to this as a 'spiritual hungering', finding solace in poetry.
it is humbling to acknowledge that the academic study of english owes, in part, its origins to the senseless tragedy of war.
the devastation and disillusionment brought by the great war dismantled the overbearing nationalism that english literature had previously thrived on, fading the prominence of figures like walter raleigh in favor of more poignant voices like wilfred owen.
these individuals were instrumental in elevating english as a serious field of study, challenging the conventional beliefs of the pre-war upper class.
their contributions set a standard of courage and innovation that subsequent movements in english studies have struggled to match.
in the early 1920s, the relevance of studying english was in doubt, but by the early 1930s, the focus had shifted to why one should spend time on anything else.
english wasn't just a subject; it became the epitome of refinement, the core of societal development.
it was not a mere hobby but a platform where profound questions about human existence—identity, meaningful relationships, core values—were explored with depth and earnest scrutiny.
the leavises launched the critical journal "scrutiny" in 1932, which remains unparalleled in its unwavering commitment to the moral significance of english studies and their crucial impact on society.
while opinions vary on scrutiny's impact, one could debate between the literary world's prejudice against the leavisian approach and the provocative nature of the scrutiny movement.
nevertheless, contemporary english students in england are inadvertently influenced by leavisite ideas, marking a significant historical milestone.
being a "leavisite" today is akin to embracing copernican ideas, ingrained in the fabric of english studies as deeply as our understanding that the earth orbits the sun.
the waning 'leavis debate' signals scrutiny's triumph and enduring legacy.
within literature, a profound appreciation for the inventive uses of language remained distinctive, revealing a stark contrast to the disdain for language and traditional culture evident in 'mass society'.
the standard of a society's language served as a clear indicator of the quality of its personal and social existence: a society that no longer cherished literature found itself devoid of the impulses crucial for nurturing and advancing human civilization.
whether observing the refined customs of eighteenth-century england or the 'natural', 'organic' lifestyle of seventeenth-century agrarian societies, one could identify a vital form of sensitivity essential for preventing the decay and demise of modern industrial society.
being an english student at cambridge in the late 1920s and 1930s meant being immersed in a lively, argumentative campaign against the superficial aspects of industrial capitalism.
students took pride in the knowledge that studying english was not only important but also the most significant way to contribute towards steering society back towards the communal ideals of seventeenth-century england.
it was believed that they were at the forefront of progress, surpassing other disciplines like law, science, politics, philosophy, or history.
while acknowledging the value of these subjects, the prevailing opinion was that literature was the ultimate arbiter, guiding a spiritual quest that mirrored the destiny of civilization itself.
with remarkable audacity, scrutiny revolutionized the landscape of english literature in a manner that criticism has never fully recovered from.
the prominent routes on this literary map traversed through renowned figures such as chaucer, shakespeare, jonson, the jacobeans, metaphysicals, bunyan, pope, samuel johnson, blake, wordsworth, keats, austen, george eliot, hopkins, henry james, joseph conrad, t.
lawrence, collectively representing 'english literature.' on the other hand, spencer, dryden, restoration drama, defoe, fielding, richardson, sterne, shelley, byron, tennyson, browning, the majority of victorian novelists, joyce, woolf, and most writers post d.
lawrence were likened to a network of less prominent routes ('b' roads) interspersed with dead-ends.
dickens experienced a fluctuating reputation, and 'english' literature predominantly consisted of conservative authors, with only two and a half women represented, including emily bronte as a disputable inclusion.
i use the term 'survive' because, aside from leavis briefly considering 'some form of economic communism', there was never any serious intention to actively transform such a society.
rather than attempting to change the mechanized society that produced this deteriorated culture, the focus was more on resisting it.
one could argue that from the outset, scrutiny had conceded defeat.
the sole type of transformation it considered was through education: by embedding themselves in educational institutions, the members of scrutiny aspired to nurture a profound, natural sensibility in a few select individuals, who could then pass it on to others.
leavis truly followed in the footsteps of matthew arnold in this belief in the power of education.
however, due to the pervasive influence of 'mass civilization', such individuals were expected to be rare, which led to the main hope being that a besieged, cultured minority could preserve the flame of culture in the current barren landscape and relay it to future generations through their students.
the prevalence of 'mass' culture does not simply result from the presence of an 'industrial' society but rather from a specific type of industrialization that prioritizes profit over utility and focuses on marketability over inherent value.
it is important to recognize that this societal structure is not fixed and can be transformed, although such changes would require more than just a deep understanding of works like king lear.
the scrutiny project, while groundbreaking in its radical approach, was also seen as somewhat impractical.
some commentators have astutely questioned whether literature alone has the power to combat the numbing effects of industrial labor and media-driven materialism, suggesting that saving against the perceived decline of the west through insightful reading may not be entirely plausible.
finding solace in the belief that delving into the works of henry james aligned one with the forefront of moral civilized thought is indeed reassuring.
however, one might ponder the vast population unfamiliar with james, who unknowingly miss out on his legacy.
these individuals, constituting the societal majority, raise questions about their moral integrity, worldly depth, and creative imagination.
it is crucial to tread carefully, possibly when referring to close ones like parents and friends.
despite lacking exposure to james, many exhibit moral conscientiousness and sensitivity, displaying no inclination towards violence or unethical behavior attributed to their unfamiliarity with james.
the perception highlighted in the discussion leans towards elitism, revealing a lack of understanding and faith in the capabilities of those who did not have the privilege of studying english at downing college.
people deemed ‘ordinary’ are embraced if they resemble seventeenth-century cowherds or ‘vital’ australian bushmen.
however, there was another issue that presented itself, which was somewhat the opposite of the initial concern.
the inability to recognize an enjambment did not always indicate a lack of moral character, just as the ability to identify one did not guarantee moral purity.
despite being deeply engaged in high culture, it was revealed about a decade after scrutiny was established that some individuals involved in such cultural pursuits had also been involved in overseeing the atrocities committed against jews in central europe.
the significance of leavisian criticism lay in its ability to address the question of why literature should be read.
the concise answer, as proposed by sir walter raleigh, was that it had the power to enrich one's character.
however, when allied forces entered concentration camps years after scrutiny was launched and arrested officials who had spent their spare time immersed in the works of goethe, it became apparent that certain conversations needed to be had.
engaging with the 'great tradition' of the english novel allowed for an exploration of fundamental value questions crucial to the lives of individuals toiling in the unproductive labor of industrial capitalism.
yet, delving into this tradition could also mean inadvertently disconnecting from these individuals, who might not immediately grasp how a poetic enjambment symbolized a physical balancing act.
the architects of english had humble lower-middle-class beginnings, a fact that might be significant in this context.
they were nonconformist, provincial, diligent, and morally upright.
consequently, the scrutineers had no trouble recognizing the superficial amateurism displayed by the upper-class english gentlemen who initially occupied the chairs of literature at the historic universities.
these individuals were not relatable to them; they were not the type of people that someone from a working-class background, like a shopkeeper's son or a draper's daughter, would naturally admire.
this elite group had essentially marginalized those from lower classes in accessing traditional universities.
while the lower middle class harbored a strong dislike toward the privileged aristocracy above them, they also made efforts to distinguish themselves from the working class below, from which they might easily slip into.
scrutiny emerged from this social ambiguity: it was radical in criticizing the literary-academic establishment yet somewhat exclusive when it came to the general populace.
its fierce dedication to "standards" presented a challenge to the elite hobbyists who regarded walter savage landor as possibly just as delightful in his unique way as john milton, while also imposing rigorous assessments on those attempting to enter the field.
the benefit was an unwavering clarity of purpose, free from trivial pursuits like wine-tasting on the one hand and the shallowness of popular culture on the other.
the drawback was a deeply entrenched isolationism: scrutiny evolved into an exclusive group that, akin to the romantics, saw itself as centrally important but in reality, remained distant, claimed to represent the true essence of cambridge while being denied academic positions, and positioned itself as the pioneers of civilization while nostalgically praising the holistic simplicity of exploited farm laborers from the seventeenth century.
the language used in commercial society was characterized as abstract and lacking vitality, having become disconnected from the tangible essence of sensory experience.
conversely, genuine "english" writing captured and portrayed such experiences vividly through language, creating a verbally intricate and sensory-rich piece of literature.
a quintessential english poem, albeit in a comical exaggeration, would resonate with the sound of biting into a crunchy apple when read aloud.
the vigor and vigor of this type of language stemmed from a rational civilization, embodying a lost creative integrity.
engaging with literature was a means to reconnect with the fundamental essence of one's existence, as it represented a self-sufficient organic society with its own unique significance—a complete social ideology.
the leavisian perspective on english identity, with its notion of a superior form of englishness, can be viewed as a scaled-down version of the upper-class elitism that played a role in shaping the language initially.
the fervent nationalism of this belief system diminished post-1918, with the influx of ex-servicemen and state-sponsored middle-class pupils into the traditionally elitist environments of oxford and cambridge.
consequently, the concept of 'englishness' shifted towards a more humble, domestically rooted alternative, steering away from grandiose displays of patriotism and embracing a more modest, countryside-inspired ethos.
this transformation in the perception and teaching of english literature reflected a changing social hierarchy within english society, emphasizing rural, populist, and provincial values over urban sophistication and aristocratic tendencies.
while it critiqued the conventional ideas espoused by figures like sir walter raleigh, it also tacitly aligned with them in some ways.
the new breed of english scholars represented a chauvinism tempered by their social standing, as they endeavored to identify with the common english folk portrayed by john bunyan rather than aligning themselves with an elitist ruling class.
in reality, a literary map was already being constructed by a body of criticism that had a significant impact on leavis.
eliot, in 1915, arrived in london as the son of an 'aristocratic' st.
louis family whose traditional cultural influence was diminishing due to the rising industrial middle class in america.
eliot was disenchanted by the spiritual emptiness of industrial capitalism and sought solace in the lifestyle of old america, yearning for an organic society where lineage and heritage held value.
feeling culturally displaced and spiritually disconnected, eliot made his way to england and embarked on what can be rightly recognized as one of the most ambitious acts of cultural imperialism witnessed in the century.
he set out to revamp and deconstruct english literary traditions, elevating the metaphysical poets and jacobean dramatists while displacing figures like milton and the romantics, and incorporating selected european influences such as the french symbolists.
eliot was critiquing the entire ideology of middle-class liberalism, which was the prevailing ruling ideology of industrial capitalist society.
liberalism, romanticism, protestantism, and economic individualism were all seen by eliot as distorted beliefs held by those who had been cast out from the harmonious organic society and had only their limited individual resources to rely on.
eliot's proposed solution leaned towards extreme right-wing authoritarianism, advocating for individuals to surrender their trivial "personalities" and opinions to a higher impersonal order.
in the realm of literature, this impersonal order took the form of the tradition.
eliot's literary tradition was highly selective, focusing less on the timeless value of past works and more on their potential to assist t.
despite its arbitrary nature, this construct paradoxically carried the weight of absolute authority, with the most significant literary works collectively forming an ideal order that could be occasionally redefined by the emergence of a new masterpiece.
the established classics within the confined space of the tradition courteously adjust their positions to accommodate a newcomer, presenting a fresh perspective in their light.
this newcomer, having been essentially encompassed in the tradition from the start to gain acceptance, validates the central values of the tradition with its entrance.
essentially, the tradition is always prepared for significant works that are yet to be written, and upon their creation, these works will prompt a reassessment of the tradition itself, seamlessly integrating into its essence.
a literary work's validity lies in its existence within the tradition, akin to a christian finding salvation by residing in god.
all poetry can be considered literature, but only select poetry embodies literature, contingent upon whether the tradition inherently permeates it.
in the realm of politics, eliot embraced different facets of authority.
he showed interest in the quasi-fascist french group action française and expressed some disparaging remarks about jews.
following his adoption of christianity in the 1920s, he propagated the idea of a predominantly rural community governed by select 'great families' and a small group of theological intellectuals akin to himself.
in this envisioned society, most individuals would adhere to christianity, although eliot doubted the capacity of the majority to hold strong beliefs, suggesting that faith would be more subconscious and expressed through daily life and seasonal rhythms.
this proposed remedy for the salvation of modern society coincided with the period when hitler's forces were advancing into poland.
eliot appreciated the advantage of using a language closely connected to human experience as it allowed poets to avoid the abstract concepts of rationalist thinking and captivate readers on a more visceral level, affecting their "cerebral cortex, nervous system, and digestive tracts." he believed that poetry should not solely engage the mind, stating that the exact meaning of a poem was not crucial, and he was unfazed by unconventional interpretations of his work.
eliot considered meaning merely a distraction for readers, while the true impact of a poem occurred through subconscious and physical means.
despite his reputation for creating intellectually challenging poetry, eliot actually demonstrated a disdain for traditional intellectualism, similar to right-wing irrationalists.
he astutely recognized that common languages of middle-class liberal rationalism had lost their potency in a post-war world littered with casualties, rendering ideas of 'progress' and 'reason' unconvincing to many.
eliot believed that language had become dull and unproductive in an industrialized society, rendering it unsuitable for poetry.
this sentiment, akin to russian formalism, was also embraced by ezra pound, t.
poetry had fallen out of favor with the romantics, transforming into sentimentally overblown and feminine, lacking in strength and directness.
language had lost its vigor and needed to be revitalized, hardened, and reintegrated with the tangible world.
the preferred imagist poem would consist of terse, gritty images in a succinct three-line structure, evoking the crispness of a military order.
emotions were seen as messy and unreliable, remnants of a former era of lofty individualistic ideals that no longer resonated with the dehumanized, mechanical reality of modern society.
lawrence, sentiments, 'personality,' and the 'ego' were equally disdained, making room for the unyielding, impersonal power of spontaneous creative life.
beneath these critical viewpoints lay political undercurrents: the era of middle-class liberalism was waning, making way for a more robust, masculine regime that pound would uncover in fascism.
at the outset, the scrutiny case did not align with extreme right-wing ideologies.
instead, it epitomized a staunch defense of liberal humanism, unlike eliot and pound, by emphasizing the importance of individual uniqueness and the interpersonal creative sphere.
these principles were encapsulated in the notion of 'life', a concept that scrutiny deliberately left ambiguous.
engaging in rational debates about their ideology was deemed insufficient; one had to either intuitively grasp the essence of life or remain disconnected.
according to scrutiny, exemplary literature was one that embraced life with reverence, showcasing its essence through artistic works.
this argument was insular, based on intuition, and impervious to counterpoints, reflecting the exclusive nature of the leavisites themselves.
it remained unclear how one's stance on life during events like the general strike correlated with embracing its vitality in poetry or advocating against mass unemployment.
the procedure in question appeared to be more than just a heightened version of wine-tasting, as different perspectives of appreciation were evident.
while the literary impressionists might categorize an experience as 'blissful', others might describe it as 'maturely robust'.
in their attempt to grasp the concept of life, the critical techniques adopted seemed somewhat limited.
the leavisites, striving to elevate beyond pragmatic criticism to address broader issues concerning civilization, sought to anchor their approach with a 'metaphysic', drawing inspiration from d.
emphasizing that life was based on specific intuitions rather than a rigid theoretical framework, individuals could defend their views by attacking existing systems.
the absolute value of life allowed for criticism against utilitarians and empiricists who failed to perceive beyond the superficial.
similar to 'practical criticism,' 'close reading' involved a meticulous and analytical interpretation that acted as a beneficial counter to superficial discussions about aesthetics.
it also seemed to suggest that previous forms of criticism only superficially engaged with the text.
to advocate for close reading goes beyond emphasizing careful attention to the text; it implies a focus on the text itself rather than the surrounding contexts that influenced it.
this approach denotes a necessary constraint on literary discussions prone to meander from analyzing a writer's language style to irrelevant details like the writer's appearance.
though 'close reading' dispelled extraneous anecdotes, it also promoted the misconception that any piece of language, whether literary or not, could be fully studied or comprehended in isolation.
richards argues that his prose's brisk and bloodless quality starkly contrasts with the complex and intense style of a leavis.
he believes that society is in a state of crisis because rapid historical changes and scientific advancements have surpassed and devalued the traditional mythologies that people have always relied on.
this has upset the delicate balance of the human psyche, and with religion no longer able to restore it, richards suggests that poetry must take on this vital role.
he boldly states that poetry has the power to save us and can be a key tool in overcoming chaos.
similar to arnold, he sees literature as a conscious ideology capable of rebuilding social order, especially in the tumultuous aftermath of the great war marked by social disruption, economic decline, and political instability.
the american new criticism emerged during the late 1930s to the 1950s, heavily influenced by various ideologies.
this movement is often associated with the works of eliot, richards, leavis, william empson, and prominent american literary critics including john crowe ransom, w.
wimsatt, cleanth brooks, allen tate, monroe beardsley, and r.
originating in the economically disadvantaged southern regions with a rich history, where a young t.
eliot was exposed to a traditional yet close-knit society.
despite the south's swift industrialization and penetration by northern business interests during the era of american new criticism, traditional southern intellectuals like john crowe ransom, for whom the movement is named, found solace in its 'aesthetic' values as a contrast to the mechanistic rationality of the industrial north.
eliot, they felt spiritually adrift amidst these societal changes.
adversely affected by the encroachment of industry, ransom initially sought solace within the fugitives literary movement in the 1920s, and later embraced the right-wing agrarian politics of the 1930s.
the foundations of new criticism were taking shape during this period: the dominance of scientific rationalism was seen as eroding the rich aesthetic aspects of the traditional south, diminishing the unique sensory qualities of human experience, with poetry emerging as a potential remedy.
unlike the scientific approach, poetry honored the innate sensory essence of its subject, emphasizing an emotional connection that bound individuals to the world in a profoundly spiritual manner.
through artistic expression, a disconnected world could be reintroduced to humanity in its diverse and vibrant entirety.
poetry, characterized primarily as a contemplative medium, was envisioned not to induce change in the world but to inspire reverence for its inherent qualities, encouraging individuals to approach it with impartial humility.
in american new criticism, the literary text was understood through a 'functionalist' lens akin to i.
this approach likened the poem to a harmonious system, mirroring the conflict-free model of society in functionalist sociology.
the poem aimed to eliminate friction and contradiction through the symmetrical cooperation of its elements, emphasizing 'coherence' and 'integration.' however, to convey a specific ideological view to readers, this thematic unity couldn't detach the poem entirely from reality but needed to correspond to it in some way, balancing internal cohesion with external relevance.
to transform the poem into an entity of its own, new criticism needed to detach it from both the author and the reader.
richards mistakenly believed that the poem merely served as a window into the poet's inner thoughts, with reading essentially involving replicating the author's mental state.
this perspective had been prevalent in traditional literary analysis, linking great literature to great individuals and emphasizing the insight it offered into their essence.
however, this approach presents various issues.
initially, it reduces all literary works to a veiled autobiography, turning them into secondary methods of getting acquainted with someone.
furthermore, this standpoint implies that literary pieces directly mirror the author's psyche, a limited approach when pondering stories like little red riding hood or heavily stylized courtly love poems.
new criticism originated during a period when literary criticism in north america was striving for professional recognition as a legitimate academic field.
it employed a range of critical tools to rival the empirical sciences, which held sway in a society where scientific principles dominated the pursuit of knowledge.
originally conceived as a humanistic response to a technologically focused culture, the movement ultimately adopted similar analytical methods.
as the decades of the 1940s and 1950s progressed, new criticism was assimilated by the academic establishment, becoming an integral part of literary criticism.
its transition from its roots in nashville, tennessee, associated with the fugitives, to the prestigious east coast ivy league universities was successfully accomplished.
new criticism gained popularity in academic circles for a couple of significant reasons.
firstly, it offered a practical teaching approach for handling a growing student body.
providing brief poems for analysis was more manageable than organizing complex courses on significant world literature.
secondly, the perspective of new criticism, which saw a poem as a delicate balance of conflicting attitudes and a neutral resolution of contradictory impulses, resonated with skeptical liberal intellectuals weary of the ideological divisions of the cold war era.
interpreting poetry through the lens of new criticism meant not aligning with any particular ideology but embracing a stance of impartial analysis.
this approach did not urge individuals to challenge mccarthyism or advocate for civil rights but rather encouraged them to view external pressures as incomplete and potentially balanced by their opposites elsewhere in the world.
essentially, it promoted political passivity and compliance with the existing political norms.
it could be observed by the reader that the concept of 'literature' seems to have transitioned subtly to 'poetry' in the analyses of recent critics.
richards focus predominantly on poetry; t.
eliot leans towards drama rather than the novel; f.
leavis addresses the novel, but through the lens of a 'dramatic poem', considering it differently from a traditional novel.
many literary theories unknowingly emphasize a specific literary genre and base their overarching statements on this preference.
exploring this phenomenon throughout the evolution of literary theory, it is possible to pinpoint the predominant literary form that serves as a model.
in modern literary theory, the evolution towards poetry holds particular significance.
poetry stands out among literary genres as the one seemingly detached from historical context, allowing pure 'sensibility' to manifest with minimal societal influence.
it becomes challenging to view works like tristram shandy or war and peace as intricately structured compositions of symbolic ambiguity.
while new criticism isolates the text from rational discussion and societal influences, empson boldly argues for interpreting poetry as a form of everyday language that can be reasonably explained, similar to our typical conversations and behaviors.
he proudly identifies as an 'intentionalist', considering the author's probable meaning and interpreting it in a generous and respectable english manner.
contrary to being a closed-off entity, empson views literary works as open to interpretation, requiring an understanding of the broader social contexts in which language is used, rather than just focusing on internal verbal connections.
these contexts are often ambiguous, as opposed to the clear concepts of 'paradox', 'irony', and 'ambivalence' championed by new criticism.
empson's irony, favored pastoral style, and the larger contradiction they represent underscore the dilemma faced by liberal literary intellectuals in the 1920s and 1930s.
they grapple with the stark disparity between their highly specialized critical acumen and the broader themes present in the literature they analyze.
this sense of bewildered, ambivalent awareness reveals the tension between delving into intricate poetic subtleties and confronting pressing economic hardships.
to reconcile these conflicting priorities, intellectuals often resort to a belief in a supposedly 'common reason', which, upon closer inspection, might prove less widespread and more socially specific than assumed.
empson's pastoral approach diverges from portraying an idyllic organic society; instead, he is drawn to its unstructured and disparate nature, finding allure in the ironic juxtapositions of aristocrats and commoners, complexity and simplicity.
empson recognizes that the meanings within a literary text are inherently ambiguous and resist being limited to one definitive interpretation.
the contrast between empson's 'ambiguity' and the new critical concept of 'ambivalence' foreshadows the later structuralist versus post-structuralist discourse we will delve into.
some have even drawn parallels between empson's focus on authorial intentions and the philosophy of edmund husserl.
regardless of the validity of this connection, it sets the stage for a smooth transition into the following chapter.
europe was left devastated in 1918 after enduring the most destructive war in history.
following this calamity, a series of social revolutions took place around the years 1920.
this period witnessed significant events such as the berlin spartacus uprising, the vienna general strike, the formation of workers' soviets in munich and budapest, and widespread factory occupations in italy.
although these uprisings were violently suppressed, the foundations of european capitalism were profoundly shaken by the war's devastation and its turbulent aftermath.
the traditional ideologies and cultural values that supported the established social order were also in a state of upheaval.
science was perceived as reduced to dry positivism, overly focused on factual categorization; philosophy found itself torn between this positivism and an unsustainable subjectivism.
relativism and irrationalism became prevalent, mirroring the confusing lack of direction present in art during this tumultuous period.
the mentioned attitude simply assumed the presence of knowledge as a given, although this was precisely the very issue to be questioned.
what then can we have a clear understanding of and be confident in?
while we might not be able to confirm the independent existence of objects, husserl contends that we can be sure of how they manifest to us directly in consciousness, irrespective of whether the object we perceive is real or deceptive.
instead of viewing objects as standalone entities, they can be seen as concepts projected or 'intended' by consciousness.
all awareness is directed towards something: during thought processes, there is an acknowledgment that the thoughts are 'directed at' a specific object.
the act of thinking and the object being thought about are interconnected and interdependent.
my consciousness is not merely a passive observer of the world but actively constructs or 'intends' it.
to ascertain certainty, it is essential to set aside or 'bracket' anything beyond our immediate experiential realm; we must narrow our focus to the contents of our consciousness alone.
however, this alone is insufficient to address our challenges.
upon examining the contents of our minds, what we often encounter is simply a haphazard array of occurrences, a disorderly flow of thoughts, which does not provide a solid foundation for certainty.
the specific 'pure' phenomena that husserl explores, on the other hand, transcend mere random instances.
they constitute a structured system of universal qualities, as phenomenology systematically analyzes each object in the mind to identify its invariant aspects.
phenomenological understanding reveals not just individual experiences like jealousy or the color red, but the essential and timeless concepts of these phenomena - such as jealousy itself or the essence of redness.
to fully comprehend any phenomenon in its entirety and purity is to grasp its fundamental and immutable characteristics.
the term for such universal concepts in greek is eidos, and thus, husserl describes his approach as involving an 'eidetic' abstraction, complemented by the practice of phenomenological reduction.
phenomenology, by focusing on what can be experientially verified, laid the groundwork for establishing genuinely reliable knowledge.
it was viewed as a master science, offering a methodology that could be applied to the study of any subject - whether it be memory, matchboxes, or mathematics.
it presented itself as a science devoted to the exploration of human consciousness, not merely as the individual experiences of people, but as the fundamental structures of the mind itself.
unlike traditional sciences, it explored the underlying conditions necessary for any form of knowledge to exist.
similar to kant's philosophy, it was a 'transcendental' form of investigation, with a focus on the 'transcendental' subject, which is the human consciousness it scrutinized.
phenomenology delved into not just our immediate perceptions of specific objects like a rabbit, but also the inherent nature of rabbits and the act of perception itself.
from this concise explanation of phenomenology, it becomes evident that it operates as a form of methodological idealism, delving into the abstraction known as 'human consciousness' and a realm of infinite possibilities.
husserl dismissed empiricism, psychologism, and the positivism of natural sciences, and distanced himself from the traditional idealism of figures like kant.
kant had struggled to resolve the issue of how the mind comprehends external objects, whereas phenomenology aimed to overcome this skepticism by asserting that pure perception unveils the true essence of phenomena.
it may appear drastically different from leavis and the concept of an organic society, but upon closer examination, there are striking similarities.
the shift towards focusing on the essence of 'things in themselves' and the disregard for abstract theories not rooted in tangible experiences is not too dissimilar from leavis's somewhat simplistic belief that poetic language encapsulates reality itself.
both leavis and husserl seek solace in the tangible, in what can be immediately grasped, during times of profound ideological unrest, and this pursuit of 'things in themselves' in their philosophies leads to a common thread of embracing irrationalism.
for husserl, understanding phenomena is infallible, described as 'apodictic', due to its intuitive nature, akin to feeling a firm tap on one's head which cannot be doubted.
leavis similarly asserts that specific forms of language are inherently 'intuitive', authentic, and imaginative, maintaining that even though criticism is viewed as a collaborative discourse, the innate correctness of certain forms of expression cannot be refuted in the end.
both husserl and leavis maintain that the act of understanding concrete phenomena reveals something universal: the eidos according to husserl and life according to leavis.
they don't need to go beyond the immediate sensation to formulate a comprehensive theory as the phenomena inherently possess one.
however, this theory tends to be authoritarian as it relies solely on intuition.
unlike the need for interpretation or reasoned arguments, phenomena for husserl present themselves forcefully, resembling certain literary judgments described by leavis as 'irresistible'.
the authoritarian demeanor displayed by leavis throughout his career correlates with a conservative disregard for rational analysis.
furthermore, husserl's 'intentional' theory of consciousness implies a close connection between 'being' and 'meaning', suggesting that subject and object are inseparable.
this notion echoes the views of english philosopher f.h. bradley, who influenced t.s. eliot.
by juxtaposing phenomenology establishing a knowable world and emphasizing the significance of the human subject, the field also pledged to offer a scientific understanding of subjectivity itself.
according to this perspective, the world is shaped by my intentions and perceptions, intrinsically linked to my consciousness, which transcends mere empirical experiences.
this insight provided a comforting realization about oneself.
the materialistic outlook of nineteenth-century science had posed a threat to the essence of subjectivity, a trend echoed by neo-kantian philosophy.
as european history unfolded from the later nineteenth century, there arose doubts about the traditional belief in human mastery over destiny and the centrality of man in the universe.
in response, phenomenology sought to reinstate the transcendental subject to its rightful position of prominence.
in the field of literary criticism, phenomenology exerted an influence on the russian formalists.
just as husserl employed the method of 'bracketing off' the real object to focus on the act of knowing it, the formalists applied a similar principle to poetry, setting aside the real object and concentrating on the perception of it.
the primary impact of phenomenology on criticism can be observed in the geneva school of criticism, which thrived notably during the 1940s and 1950s.
key figures within this school included belgian scholar georges poulet, swiss critics jean starobinski and jean rousset, and frenchman jean-pierre richard.
additionally, emii staiger, a german professor at the university of zurich, and the early writings of american critic j.
hillis miller were also affiliated with this critical movement.
phenomenological criticism seeks to apply the phenomenological method to literary works.
similar to husserl's concept of 'bracketing,' it involves disregarding the real-world elements such as historical context, authorship, production conditions, and readership in favor of an entirely 'immanent' interpretation of the text.
this approach aims to view the text as a pure reflection of the author's consciousness, where all stylistic and semantic elements form an interconnected whole representing the author's mind.
understanding the author's mind requires focusing solely on the text itself, without referring to external sources.
biographical criticism is rejected in this method as it brings in external factors that manifest in the work.
instead, emphasis is placed on identifying the 'deep structures' of the author's mind through recurring themes and imagery, connecting the author's subjective experience to their perception of the objective world.
to analyze a work effectively, one must set aside personal preferences and immerse oneself fully in the world the work presents.
when examining a christian poem, for example, the focus should be on understanding and conveying the author's perspective rather than passing judgment on it.
this approach to analysis is objective and non-evaluative, aiming to faithfully reproduce the essence of the work without imposing the critic's own views.
rather than interpreting the text actively, this method sees criticism as a passive reception of the material, capturing its core ideas without bias.
this perspective views literary works as cohesive entities and allows for seamless transitions between diverse texts by the same author in search of underlying connections.
phenomenological criticism posits that the language used in a literary work merely conveys its underlying meanings.
this perspective traces its roots back to husserl himself, where language holds a secondary role in phenomenology.
according to husserl, there exists a private realm of experience, though acknowledging that such privacy is fictional given the inherently social nature of language.
claiming a completely private experience is deemed nonsensical, as every experience necessitates a linguistic framework for identification.
husserl emphasizes that what lends significance to an experience is not language itself, but the intentional act of perceiving specific phenomena as universal concepts independent of language.
essentially, husserl asserts that meaning predates language, with language serving only as a secondary tool to articulate pre-existing meanings.
the notion of a seemingly irrelevant, individual expression untouched by external influences serves as a particularly apt representation of phenomenology as a whole.
despite its assertions of having rescued the 'real world' of human actions and encounters from the dry constraints of traditional philosophy, phenomenology ultimately exists as a mind detached from its surroundings.
it proposes to establish a secure foundation for human understanding but can only do so at a significant expense: the relinquishment of human history itself.
certainly, human meanings are fundamentally historical; they do not involve grasping the essential universality of what it means to be an onion, but rather revolve around evolving, practical interactions among societal individuals.
despite its emphasis on reality as lived and experienced – the lebenswelt over lifeless facts – its approach to that reality remains contemplative and ahistorical.
we come into existence as individuals within a reality that we can never fully objectify.
this reality includes both the 'subject' and the 'object', is rich in meanings, and shapes us as much as we shape it.
the world cannot be reduced to mere mental images, as it possesses its own stubborn, unyielding essence that resists our intentions, with us existing as an integral part of it.
while husserl emphasized the importance of the transcendental ego, reflecting a rationalist philosophy, which places human beings at the center of the world, heidegger offers a different perspective.
heidegger challenges the idea of human dominance over the world and instead suggests that human existence is a dialogue with the world, where listening is more significant than speaking.
according to heidegger, human knowledge originates from and operates within a framework of 'pre-understanding'.
before engaging in systematic thinking, we already hold numerous implicit assumptions derived from our direct interactions with the world.
science and theory serve as incomplete abstractions of these practical experiences, much like a map represents a real terrain.
true understanding is not solely a product of individual cognition but is ingrained in the essence of human existence.
human life is characterized by constantly envisioning and pursuing new potentials, always projecting forward, and never stagnant in self-identity.
one's existence is not a fully graspable entity, but a continuous exploration of possibilities, inherently linked to history and time.
human existence is not only shaped by time, but also intricately intertwined with language.
according to heidegger, language is not just a tool for communication or a means of expressing ideas; it constitutes the very essence in which human life exists and embodies the world.
the presence of language is essential for the concept of 'world' to exist in a unique human context.
heidegger views language as more than just individual speech; it has its own existence that individuals partake in, ultimately defining their humanity.
language transcends the individual, serving as the medium in which humans navigate their existence, offering a space where reality subtly reveals itself and invites contemplation, rather than merely serving as a vehicle for transmitting factual information.
the error of the western metaphysical tradition lies in viewing being as an objective entity separate from the subject.
heidegger advocates a return to pre-socratic thought, seeking to transcend the dualistic idea of subject versus object and instead perceive being as inclusive of both.
this paradigm shift prompts a profound reverence for the mystery of being.
rejecting the enlightenment rationality that imposes a dominating, utilitarian approach to nature, heidegger calls for a humble reverence for the natural world - a sentiment that a critic describes as resembling a 'stupefied peasant'.
he argues that humanity should yield itself entirely to being by reconnecting with the earth, which he sees as the ultimate source of all significance.
heidegger, known as the black forest philosopher, aligns with the romantic concept of an 'organic society', yet the implications of his ideology are portrayed as potentially more ominous than those of leavis.
one significant aspect of this philosophy is its emphasis on how theoretical knowledge always originates from practical social interests.
heidegger's concept of a comprehensible object is notably that of a tool: we perceive the world not passively but as a network of interconnected entities that, like a hammer, serve a purpose within a specific practical endeavor.
understanding is closely linked to action.
however, beyond this utilitarian approach lies a reflective mysticism: in the event of a broken tool, when its taken-for-granted nature is disrupted, it reveals its true essence to us.
a broken tool embodies its essence more than an intact one.
heidegger, akin to the formalists, believes that art functions in a similar manner of 'defamiliarization': as seen in van gogh's portrayal of peasant shoes, the artist can estrange objects and reveal their deeply inherent essence.
in the later works of heidegger, art emerges as the space where phenomenological truths can authentically reveal themselves.
similarly, for leavis, literature embodies a mode of existence that contemporary society seems to have misplaced.
contrary to common belief, art and language are not merely mediums for individual expression; rather, they serve as conduits through which the inherent truths of the world find a voice.
heidegger posits that engaging with a poem demands a receptive ear that enables the truth within the text to manifest itself.
according to heidegger, interpreting literature is not an action we take but a process we allow to unfold naturally.
by immersing ourselves in a text and embracing its unfathomable essence, we undergo a transformative interrogation that challenges our understanding.
our attitude towards art, therefore, should embody a sense of humility akin to the submissive stance heidegger recommended for the german populace towards the fuhrer.
it seems that in contrast to the domineering rationality of bourgeois industrial society, the only viable alternative lies in a submissive surrender to the enigmatic power of art.
this might or might not be accurate; however, it does not appear to directly impact how i engage with history in terms of being intertwined with specific individuals, real social interactions, and tangible institutions.
from heidegger's loftily philosophical writing style, all of this seems rather insignificant.
according to heidegger, authentic history is an internal exploration of fear and emptiness, a facing of mortality, and a consolidation of personal strength that essentially functions as a replacement for history in its more common and practical definitions.
as noted by hungarian critic georg lukacs, heidegger's renowned concept of "historicity" is truly distinct from a lack of historical perspective.
ultimately, heidegger's attempt to challenge the enduring, unchanging truths of husserl and the western metaphysical tradition through a historical perspective proves unsuccessful.
instead of dismantling these truths, he introduces a new metaphysical concept - dasein itself.
his work can be seen as an evasion of history rather than a confrontation, much like his flirtation with fascism.
fascism is portrayed as a final effort by monopoly capitalism to eliminate unbearable contradictions by promoting an alternative history centered on themes of race, death, self-sacrifice, and a lasting reich.
it is not asserted that heidegger's entire philosophy is merely a justification for fascism; rather, it is suggested that both ideologies offered imaginary solutions to the crisis of modern history, sharing several common characteristics.
is it possible to comprehend works that are culturally and historically distant from us?
can we attain an 'objective' understanding, or is all understanding contingent on our own historical context?
these questions extend beyond mere 'literary interpretation'.
according to husserl, meaning was considered an 'intentional object'.
he suggested that it neither boiled down to the psychological processes of a speaker or listener, nor existed entirely independently from such mental activities.
this perspective argued that meaning was not as concrete as a piece of furniture, yet it was not purely subjective either.
rather, it was viewed as an 'ideal' object that could be conveyed in various forms while maintaining the same core meaning.
from this standpoint, the significance of a literary piece is permanently established: it aligns with the 'mental object' conceived or 'intended' by the author during the writing process.
you may want to try an experiment by pausing from reading the book for a moment and silently 'meaning' something in your mind.
was it different from the words you just used to shape your response?
thinking that meaning is a combination of words along with a non-verbal act of will or intention is akin to thinking that each time i intentionally open a door, i also perform a silent act of will concurrently.
determining the intended meaning of a piece of writing based on what might be going on in the author's mind poses significant challenges.
the author may have had various thoughts while writing.
hirsch acknowledges this complexity but distinguishes it from 'verbal meaning.' to support his argument, he simplifies the author's intended meanings into manageable categories known as meaning 'types.' these broad typologies of meaning, according to hirsch, allow critics to distill and interpret the textual content effectively.
by focusing on these overarching meanings, specific details are excluded.
critics are tasked with identifying the 'intrinsic genre' of a text, referring to the general conventions and perspectives that likely influenced the author's intentions during the writing process.
there is likely no more information available to us beyond this point: it would probably be impossible to ascertain the exact meaning intended by shakespeare when he used the term 'cream-fac'd loon'.
therefore, we must make do with a general understanding of what he may have intended.
the specifics of a work are assumed to be influenced by these general interpretations.
whether this approach adequately captures the nuances, intricacies, and conflicting elements of literary works is a separate issue.
in order to fix the interpretation of a work permanently, shielding it from the impacts of history, literary criticism must regulate its potentially chaotic specifics, confining them within the framework of 'typical' meanings.
its attitude towards the text is authoritative and legalistic: anything that falls outside the bounds of 'likely authorial intent' is summarily dismissed, and everything that fits within that framework is strictly subservient to this overarching purpose.
the immutable meaning of the holy scripture has been protected; the question of how one engages with it, or its practical use, merely becomes a secondary matter of 'importance'.
interestingly, hirsch acknowledges that his perspective is somewhat arbitrary.
he argues that there is no inherent element in the text itself that mandates a reader to interpret it in line with the author's intended meaning.
however, choosing not to adhere to the author's intent could lead to a lack of a definitive standard for interpretation, potentially resulting in critical chaos.
similar to authoritarian systems, hirsch's theory struggles to logically justify its own prescribed values.
there is fundamentally no stronger rationale for favoring the author's intention over interpretations proposed by a critic based on superficial attributes like hair length or foot size.
hirsch's defense of authorial meaning can be likened to justifications for hereditary titles, which often trace their legal lineage through generations but ultimately admit that these titles were originally obtained through conflicts with others.
even if critics were able to access an author's intent, would this definitively fix the meaning of a literary text?
what if we delved into understanding the meaning behind the author's intentions, and then continued this cycle?
the assurance of meaning would only be possible if the authorial meanings were viewed as hirsch presents them: as absolute, stable, and self-consistent facts that can solidly underpin the work.
however, this perspective of meaning is highly questionable.
meanings, even those originating from authors, are not as firm and unequivocal as hirsch argues, mainly because, contrary to his stance, they are influenced by language, which inherently carries an element of ambiguity.
determining what it means to have a 'pure' intention or convey a 'pure' meaning is challenging; hirsch's separation of meaning from language enables his reliance on such elusive constructs.
however, he disregards the fact that this reconstructing process is limited by his own historical context, meaning, and perspective.
ironically, his argument challenges this very 'historicism'.
similar to husserl, he presents a type of knowledge that is impartial and transcends time.
despite claiming to protect the unchanging essence of literary works from modern ideologies, his personal bias reveals a possible reason to question the validity of his assertions.
hirsch takes aim at the hermeneutics of heidegger, gadamer, and other thinkers.
he argues that their emphasis on the historicity of meaning can lead to complete relativism.
according to this view, a literary work could hold different meanings on different days.
hirsch is concerned about this potential for relativism and turns to husserl to counter it.
he posits that meaning remains constant because it is always anchored in the intentional act of an individual at a specific moment in time.
however, this proposition seems flawed in one obvious way.
for instance, if i tell you to "close the door!" and then hastily add, "i actually meant to open the window," you could rightfully argue that the phrase "close the door" retains its meaning regardless of my intentions.
it is possible to envision scenarios in which the phrase 'close the door' could carry a different connotation from its typical meaning, such as serving as a figurative expression for 'do not negotiate any further'.
the interpretation of a sentence, like any other, is not rigidly fixed; through sufficient creativity, multiple interpretations could be devised.
however, when a strong wind is rushing through the room and i am dressed in a swimsuit, the intended meaning would likely be evident based on the situation.
unless there was a slip of the tongue or an unexplained momentary distraction, it would be fruitless for me to argue that i had actually intended to say 'open the window'.
this serves as a clear example illustrating that the meaning of my words is not solely determined by my personal intentions and that i cannot arbitrarily assign any meaning to my words, contrary to the misconception held by humpty dumpty in alice in wonderland.
hirsch would acknowledge this idea to some extent, categorizing it as 'significance'; however, gadamer considers this fluctuation as an inherent aspect of the artwork.
according to gadamer, all interpretation is context-dependent, influenced and limited by the culturally specific standards of a given era; there is no way to ascertain the literary text in its pure form.
hirsch identifies this 'skepticism' as the most disconcerting element in heideggerian hermeneutics, and he fights against it through his defensive approach.
according to gadamer, interpreting a past work entails engaging in a dialogue between the past and the present.
when encountering such a work, we approach it with a heideggerian sense of openness, allowing its distinct voice to challenge our current concerns.
however, the message or meaning that the work communicates to us is influenced by the questions we pose to it from our unique historical perspective.
understanding the work also involves uncovering the specific question it seeks to address, as it engages in a conversation with its own historical context.
all interpretation is considered generative, involving a process of perceiving things differently, uncovering new possibilities within the text, and impacting it in a meaningful way.
the present moment is comprehensible only in relation to the past, forming a continuous narrative, while our understanding of the past is always filtered through our current standpoint.
true understanding occurs when our historical framework and assumptions merge with the context within which the work exists.
it is difficult to understand why hirsch would be so unsettled by all this.
in contrast, everything appears overwhelmingly harmonious.
gadamer can calmly yield himself and literature to the currents of history because ultimately, these dispersed fragments will find their way back home.
this reunion is ensured by the existence of a unifying essence, referred to as 'tradition', that quietly stretches across past, present, and future.
eliot's perspective, all 'authentic' texts are connected to this tradition, which not only communicates through the historical works i am contemplating but also communicates through me during the act of 'authentic' contemplation.
the interconnection of past and present, observer and observed, the unfamiliar and the familiar is securely intertwined by a greater existence that encompasses them both.
gadamer is not troubled by the potential influence of our implicit cultural biases or 'pre-understandings' on the interpretation of past literary works because these preconceptions stem from the tradition itself, to which the literary work belongs.
prejudices that stem from creativity and tradition are considered more valid compared to fleeting and biased ones.
these creative biases surface from traditions and allow us to engage with them deeply.
the credibility of the tradition, combined with our own thoughtful introspection, helps in distinguishing between legitimate and unfounded preconceptions.
instead of hindering real comprehension, the historical gap between us and a past work actually assists in understanding by removing elements that were only temporarily relevant.
in simpler terms, the issue with ideology lies in its inability to acknowledge that throughout human history, the ongoing 'dialogue' frequently resembles a one-sided speech from those in power to those who lack it.
even in situations perceived as a 'dialogue,' such as between men and women, there is often a noticeable power imbalance.
the problem arises from the failure to realize that communication is intertwined with a potentially oppressive power dynamic, especially within its own discourse.
hermeneutics primarily focuses on analyzing past literary works, with its theoretical inquiries stemming mainly from this historical approach.
rooted in scriptures, this emphasis on classics underlines the crucial role of interpretation in understanding literature.
the traditional orientation of hermeneutics dictates a preference for cohesive, 'organic' wholes in literary pieces.
this interpretive method involves integrating each component of a text into a unified whole, often referred to as the 'hermeneutical circle.' in this process, individual elements gain meaning within the broader context, while the overall context gains clarity through the individual components.
while hermeneutics typically disregards the possibility of literature being fragmented, incomplete, or self-contradictory, there are arguments supporting the existence of such characteristics.
one reason why the latter solution seems improbable is that the query appears too casual for a celestial voice, and considering updike is typically a realist writer who doesn't usually employ such devices.
however, a writer's body of work may not always present a coherent narrative, so it's not advisable to heavily rely on this assumption.
realistically, it's improbable that the question is posed by a group speaking in unison and somewhat unlikely that it comes from someone other than piet or angela hanema.
this is indicated by the subsequent mention of them undressing, hinting they're likely a married couple, and aware that in our birmingham suburb, couples typically do not undress in front of others, though they may do so privately.
as we analyze these sentences, we start making various assumptions.
for instance, we could deduce that the term 'couple' alludes to a man and a woman, even though the text does not explicitly indicate they are not two women or animals.
it is implied that the person asking the question does not possess mind-reading abilities; otherwise, there would be no reason to inquire.
it seems probable that the interrogator values the opinion of the respondent; however, without further context, we cannot ascertain if the query is not sarcastic or hostile.
the expression 'the hanemas' likely serves as an appositive to 'piet and angela,' clarifying that it is their surname and hinting at a marital connection.
it is conceivable, though, that there could be a separate entity known as the hanemas besides piet and angela, possibly a collective group engaging in a communal undressing ceremony.
it has been implied that piet and angela are undressing in each other's presence, but there is no explicit mention ruling out the possibility of them being in separate rooms or locations such as different bedrooms or beach huts.
while it could be conjectured that they are young children, the complexity of the question presented suggests otherwise.
by now, many readers might have inferred that piet and angela hanema are a married couple disrobing together in their bedroom post an event, possibly a party where another newlywed couple was in attendance, even though this scenario is not explicitly stated.
being the first two sentences of the novel, it implies that many unanswered questions will gradually be resolved as we progress through the text.
the act of speculating and inferring triggered by our initial lack of information is essentially a heightened version of the analytical process we naturally engage in while reading.
further complications will arise as we continue, necessitating additional assumptions for resolution.
despite receiving more explicit information than what is provided in these introductory sentences, we are still required to formulate potentially ambiguous explanations.
the commencement of updike's novel demands a significant degree of intricate, often subconscious analysis: albeit subtly, we are persistently forming theories about the text's significance.
through implicit associations, gap filling, deduction, and hypothesis testing, the reader relies on both a broad knowledge of the world and familiarity with literary norms.
the text acts as a set of prompts to the reader, encouraging them to assemble a string of words into a coherent meaning.
following the principles of reception theory, the reader is the one who gives substance to the literary piece, which essentially consists of organized symbols on a page.
without the reader's continuous active involvement, there would be no literary creation at all.
despite appearing cohesive, any work under reception theory comprises 'gaps,' similar to how tables are viewed in modern physics - representing spaces that need to be filled in, such as the transition between the first and second sentences of couples, where the reader must bridge the missing link.
the piece is abundant in 'indeterminacies,' components that rely on the reader's interpretation and can be understood in various, sometimes conflicting ways.
the intriguing paradox is that the more details the work includes, the more uncertain its meaning becomes.
according to reception theory, the act of reading is an intricate and evolving process over time.
the literary piece is viewed by the theorist roman ingarden as a collection of 'schemata' or guidelines that the reader must bring to life.
readers approach the text with existing beliefs and expectations, against which they evaluate its features.
as the reading progresses, these beliefs are adjusted by new information, leading to a hermeneutical circle wherein the reader moves between analyzing parts and the whole.
seeking to make sense of the text, readers organize its components into coherent structures, emphasizing some and disregarding others, while interpreting specific elements in specific ways.
they strive to maintain various viewpoints within the text or transition between them to construct a unified 'illusion'.
the knowledge acquired from page one is prone to fading in memory and may be altered by subsequent information.
reading is not a linear process; our initial interpretations lay a foundation for understanding, but later insights can reshape our views, emphasizing certain aspects while downplaying others.
as we progress in reading, we discard assumptions, adjust beliefs, and make intricate inferences; each sentence sets the stage for the next, validating, challenging, or altering our understanding.
we engage in a dual process of looking back and looking ahead, anticipating and recalling, while acknowledging the multiple interpretations of the text that our reading may dismiss.
additionally, this cognitive process occurs simultaneously on various levels, as the text presents different viewpoints, layers of meaning, and narrative dimensions that we navigate throughout the reading experience.
to understand the significance of the words on a sign instructing dog owners to carry their pets on escalators, one must recognize that these words constitute a 'code of reference.' this signifies that the message is not merely for amusement but serves as a directive concerning the conduct of dogs and their owners on escalators.
it requires the observer to draw upon their societal understanding to grasp that the sign is a directive from authorities who have the jurisdiction to penalize violators.
the public is thus subtly being addressed.
although this message is not explicit within the text alone, decoding it correctly involves integrating social norms and contextual cues.
furthermore, interpreting the sign correctly necessitates applying reading conventions to discern that 'the escalator' refers to the specific one present rather than one abroad, and that 'must be carried' indicates an immediate action requirement.
iser believes that understanding literature involves more than just decoding it based on familiar codes.
he argues that if literary works perfectly aligned with the codes we use for interpretation, they would lack inspiration.
instead, he posits that the most impactful literary pieces challenge readers to reassess their usual codes and expectations.
by questioning and reshaping our ingrained beliefs, literature exposes and disrupts our ordinary ways of perceiving things, prompting a critical awareness.
rather than simply reinforcing our existing perceptions, valuable literary works defy or surpass these conventional norms of interpretation, introducing new frameworks for comprehension.
this notion echoes russian formalism, where the act of reading serves to defamiliarize our standard assumptions, allowing us to scrutinize and potentially revise them.
iser's reception theory is rooted in a liberal humanist ideology that emphasizes the importance of being flexible and open-minded in our approach to reading.
it suggests that readers should be willing to challenge their beliefs and allow them to evolve.
this perspective is influenced by gadamerian hermeneutics, which values self-discovery through encounters with the unfamiliar.
despite appearing liberal on the surface, iser's humanism actually implies that readers with strong ideological convictions may struggle to fully engage with literary works and experience transformative effects.
the implication is that to truly be impacted by a text, one must approach it with a willingness to reconsider their beliefs.
it is suggested that an ideal reader, according to iser, would already possess liberal tendencies, as the act of reading shapes a human subject while also assuming certain qualities in the reader.
iser attempts to break free from this detrimental cycle by emphasizing literature's ability to challenge and transform the reader's preconceived notions.
however, this approach also relies on the existence of a specific type of reader that it aims to cultivate.
the interplay between reader and text mirrors the exclusivity of the academic field of literature, which favors specific texts and readers over others.
however, this act of generosity comes with a strict requirement: the reader must interpret the text in a way that ensures internal coherence.
iser's approach to reading emphasizes the necessity of aligning the individual elements to form a cohesive whole.
this functionalist perspective stems from the influence of gestalt psychology, which aims to unify separate perceptions into a coherent entity.
it is worth noting that this bias is deeply ingrained in contemporary critics, portraying it not just as a doctrinal preference but as a debatable predisposition.
there is no inherent obligation for literary works to present a seamless unity, and literary criticism often grapples with conflicting and nuanced meanings to facilitate this cohesion.
contrasting ingarden's organicist interpretations, iser appreciates the fragmented nature of modernist works as they prompt readers to be more aware of the interpretative process.
textual ambiguities motivate us to eliminate them, as iser suggests, by replacing them with a fixed meaning.
these uncertainties must be controlled and organized into a coherent structure.
the reader appears to be not only interpreting the text but also grappling with it, endeavoring to confine its chaotic, multifaceted potential within a comprehensible framework.
iser talks about the necessity of 'constraining' this potential for multiple meanings into order, which may seem contradictory for a critic who claims to be a pluralist.
failure to do so might endanger the cohesive reading experience, preventing the reader from achieving a balanced understanding through the corrective act of reading.
engrossed in the lively language dance and savoring the intricacies of words, readers lean more towards experiencing the joy of deconstructing a coherent structure.
rather than skillfully connecting textual components to reinforce a unified self, they are drawn to the sensation of having their identity fragmented and scattered amidst the complex webs within the text.
reading is likened to a boudoir rather than a controlled environment.
instead of leading readers back to themselves, ensuring the restoration of their questioned selfhood through the act of reading, the modernist text disrupts one's stable cultural identity in a delight that barthes describes as a blend of readerly pleasure and a carnal release.
barthes's theory, while not void of challenges, raises concerns about its self-indulgent avant-garde hedonism in a world where some lack basic necessities like food.
in contrast to iser's restrained model that limits the potential of language, barthes offers a more personal, detached, and essentially anarchic encounter that could be seen as the opposite side of the same coin.
both scholars reveal a liberal aversion to structured thinking and overlook the reader's historical context.
readers engage with texts within their social and historical contexts, shaping their interpretations of literary works significantly.
while iser predominantly focuses on the 'aesthetic' elements of reading and acknowledges the social aspect, hans robert jauss, a more historically-oriented figure from the constance school, adopts a gadamerian approach.
he aims to position a literary work within its historical 'horizon,' the cultural context in which it originated, and then delves into the evolving connections between this setting and the shifting perspectives of its historical readers.
the objective is to create a fresh kind of literary analysis that shifts the focus from authors, influences, and literary trends to viewing literature through its historical receptions.
it suggests that texts and literary conventions are actively reconfigured based on the diverse historical 'horizons' from which they are perceived, rather than remaining static while interpretations evolve.
'consumption' within literary creation, just like any other form of production, is an integral part of the production process.
for example, when a novel begins with the line 'jack staggered red-nosed out of the pub,' it presupposes a reader with a proficient grasp of english, familiarity with pubs, and cultural awareness regarding the association of alcohol with facial redness.
the necessity for an audience transcends mere desire; the language selected inherently points towards a specific group of potential readers, demonstrating that writers often do not have complete autonomy over their audience.
while a writer may not consciously target a particular type of reader and may exhibit complete indifference towards the readership of their work, the act of writing itself already embeds a certain type of reader within the text's internal framework.
even in my private conversations with myself, my words would lack their essence if they did not anticipate a potential listener rather than merely reflecting my own thoughts.
sartre's examination delves into the query of 'for whom does one write?' from a historical standpoint rather than an 'existential' one.
the study follows the evolution of french writers from the seventeenth century when the 'classical' style symbolized a mutual understanding or common ground between writer and reader, to the introspective nature of nineteenth-century literature directed towards a bourgeoisie it held in contempt.
it concludes with the predicament of the modern 'committed' writer, who struggles to find an audience among the bourgeoisie, the working class, or an abstract notion of 'humanity in general'.
the reception theory proposed by jauss and iser raises a significant epistemological issue.
viewing the 'text in itself' as a framework or 'schemata' waiting for readers to interpret, how can one discuss these schemata without first interpreting them?
when referring to the 'text itself' and comparing it to specific interpretations, is one truly evaluating anything beyond their own interpretation?
does the critic claim an all-knowing perspective of the 'text in itself', a viewpoint not accessible to readers who must rely on their subjective understanding of the text?
this dilemma resembles the classic problem of how one can be certain the light in the refrigerator is off when the door is closed.
although roman ingarden acknowledges this challenge, he fails to offer a satisfactory solution; on the other hand, iser advocates for reader freedom within certain boundaries, highlighting the complexity of interpretation.
not all reception theorists perceive this situation as embarrassing.
stanley fish, an american critic, is actually content with the notion that there is no 'objective' work of literature present on the seminar table.
to him, bleak house is essentially a collection of various interpretations of the novel that have been or will be presented.
according to fish, the true writer is the reader who, no longer content with just collaborating in the literary discourse as suggested by iser, has now deposed the authorities and seized control.
for fish, reading is not about uncovering the text's meaning but rather about undergoing the impact it has on the reader.
his understanding of language embraces pragmatism: for instance, a change in wording may elicit surprise or disorientation, and criticism is merely a reflection of how readers respond to the sequence of words on the page.
what the text 'does' to readers is in fact influenced by how readers interpret it, focusing on the structure of their experience rather than any inherently 'objective' structure within the text itself.
every aspect of the text - its syntax, meanings, and structural elements - is a result of interpretation rather than a 'factually' predetermined entity.
this leads to the thought-provoking query of what fish perceives he is analyzing when reading.
his candid response to this pondering is that he is uncertain, a sentiment he believes is shared by others as well.
fish is cautious in preventing the potential hermeneutical chaos his theory could create.
to prevent multiple conflicting interpretations, he relies on specific "interpretative strategies" shared by readers that dictate their responses.
he emphasizes that not all interpretations are valid, especially considering the informed readers within academic circles who are expected to offer responses aligned enough to facilitate meaningful discussion.
fish argues that the text itself does not contain inherent meaning waiting to be unlocked by readers; he dismisses the notion of meaning being 'immanent' in the text and waiting for interpretation.
he criticizes wolfgang iser for allegedly falling into this illusion.
there are no absolute facts devoid of human interpretations, and no facts exist beyond our awareness.
presently, few philosophers of science would disagree that laboratory data are subject to interpretation, albeit distinct from interpretations akin to the darwinian theory of evolution.
while scientific hypotheses and data are both considered interpretations, the age-old notion in philosophy of science of a rigid divide between them is mistakenly perceived as unbridgeable.
for instance, understanding eleven black marks as the word 'nightingale' is an interpretation, as is recognizing them as black, eleven, or a word.
however, interpreting these marks as 'nightgown' in most contexts would be incorrect.
a widely accepted interpretation can be considered a way to define a fact.
the identification of these symbols with a specific bird species is entirely arbitrary and is determined by linguistic and historical conventions.
if the evolution of the english language had taken a different path, these symbols might have represented something else entirely, perhaps even 'dichotomous' in a different, unfamiliar language.
in some cultures, these symbols may not be perceived as mere imprints or marks, but rather as black elements naturally present within the white paper that have surfaced for a reason.
these cultures may utilize a counting system distinct from ours and quantify the symbols as not eleven but rather as three plus a variable number.
furthermore, in their writing system, there could be no differentiation between the terms 'nightingale' and 'nightgown'.
evidently, language is not inherently fixed or predetermined, as evidenced by the fact that the english word 'nightingale' has undergone multiple interpretations over time.
the assertion that we can interpret a piece of literature in any manner we choose is, in a way, reasonable.
what truly stands in our way?
the possibilities are limitless when it comes to creating various contexts for its words to convey different meanings.
however, on another level, this notion is essentially a whimsical idea fostered by individuals who may have spent an excessive amount of time in academic settings.
literary texts are an integral part of language as a whole and are intricately connected to various linguistic conventions, despite the possibility of challenging or defying them.
language is not something we have absolute freedom to manipulate as we please.
for example, if the word 'nightingale' automatically triggers thoughts of seeking solace in nature away from urban life, it holds a certain influence or sway over me that persists even when encountered within a poem.
however, the act of interpreting a poem offers a greater sense of freedom compared to interpreting a notice on the london underground.
the freedom in poetry interpretation stems from the practical context in which the language is used.
this practicality restricts certain interpretations while validating others.
this limitation, as discussed earlier, is not absolute but is noteworthy.
in the realm of literary works, there is a practical context that similarly restricts some interpretations and approves others, often embodied by the teacher or academic institution.
the academic environment and the established norms of interpreting literature function as constraints in this scenario.
these authorized methods of interpretation are neither inherently natural nor solely academic; they reflect the prevalent modes of evaluating and interpreting texts within a society.
these conventions are active not only when analyzing a popular novel on a train but also when delving into a poem in a university setting.
i initiated this book by challenging the notion of 'literature' as a static entity and contended that literary principles are not as definite as commonly perceived.
the complexity of defining a literary work itself has become apparent.
one approach to interpreting it is through authorial intent, as examined in the discussion on e.
hirsch, highlighting the drawbacks of this method.
another method is fish's theory of a shared 'interpretative strategy', a collective proficiency presumed in readers, particularly within academic circles.
it is evident that there exists a significant academic influence that dictates acceptable interpretations, encompassing publishers, literary editors, reviewers, and academia within the 'literary institution'.
however, disagreements and conflicts of interpretations can arise within the literary institution, which fish's model does not seem to address adequately.
these disagreements are not just about different readings of poets such as holderlin or beckett, but also involve debates over the very categories, standards, and methodologies of interpretation itself.
few educators or critics are likely to criticize an analysis of holderlin or beckett simply because it differs from their own.
however, more of them might object to such an analysis if they deem it as 'non-literary' for crossing established boundaries and methods of 'literary criticism'.
literary criticism, as a field, does not typically advocate for a singular interpretation as long as it adheres to 'literary critical' principles; however, the definitions of what constitutes literary criticism are set by the literary establishment.
this demonstrates that the openness of the literary institution, akin to wolfgang iser's views, often overlooks its own inherent limitations.
at the conclusion of the introduction, american literary theory was entrenched in new criticism, refining its techniques while resisting the influence of modern science and industrialism.
however, as north american society evolved during the 1950s, becoming increasingly influenced by science and managerial ideologies, a more ambitious style of critical technocracy began to be sought after.
although new criticism had been effective, it was considered somewhat modest and narrow in scope to be deemed a rigorous academic discipline.
by focusing intensely on individual literary works and nurturing sensibilities, it tended to neglect the broader structural dimensions of literature.
questions arose about the neglect of literary history and the need for a literary theory that, while retaining new criticism's formalistic approach and emphasis on literature as an aesthetic entity rather than a social phenomenon, would integrate a more comprehensive and scientific framework.
a proposed theory of literary 'modes' categorizes different genres based on the portrayal of the hero.
in myth, the hero is depicted as superior in kind, in romance as superior in degree, in the 'high mimetic' modes like tragedy and epic as superior in degree but not to his surroundings, in the 'low mimetic' modes such as comedy and realism as equal to ordinary individuals, and in satire and irony as inferior.
tragedy and comedy can be further classified into high mimetic, low mimetic, and ironic subcategories; tragedy highlights human solitude, while comedy focuses on human unity.
additionally, three recurring symbolism patterns - apocalyptic, demonic, and are recognized.
this system can be viewed as an analogical and cyclical theory of literary history, suggesting literature transitions from myth to irony and eventually back to myth.
by 1957, indications pointed to being in the ironic phase with hints of an imminent return to the mythic period.
in order to establish his literary system, of which the above is just a partial explanation, frye's first task is to eliminate any subjective value judgments that could obstruct his path, as he considers them merely personal opinions.
when we analyze literature, we are discussing its literary aspects; however, when we evaluate it, we are essentially referring to our own thoughts.
additionally, his system must exclude any history other than literary history, as literary works are constructed from within the boundaries of the literature itself, without needing any external materials.
the benefit of frye's theory lies in maintaining literature separate from historical influences in the style of new criticism, regarding it as a self-contained process of reusing texts.
however, unlike new criticism, his theory proposes a form of substitute history within literature, reflecting the broad scope and collective structures of history.
the literary modes and myths are considered to be transcending historical periods, blurring history to a point where it all becomes the same or a series of recurring variations on similar themes.
to sustain the system's integrity, it must remain tightly sealed off from external influences to prevent any disruption of its established categories.
frye's work underscores the utopian essence of literature, driven by a profound unease with the real social world and a lack of interest in history.
in literature, one can transcend the mundane constraints of everyday language and find a spiritual sanctuary.
the underlying myths of this theory are rooted in idyllic pre-urban representations of natural cycles and wistful recollections of a pre-industrial era.
frye views actual history as confining and deterministic, positioning literature as the sole realm of liberation.
this prompts reflection on the historical context that could make such a theory compelling.
the strength of this perspective lies in its fusion of intense aestheticism with a pseudo-scientific cataloging method, presenting literature as an imaginative escape from contemporary society while upholding the credibility of criticism within societal norms.
it rejects verbose literary analysis in favor of swiftly categorizing each work into its mythological archetype with mechanized precision, yet it also embraces a deeply romantic sensibility.
northrop frye's work can be loosely associated with structuralism, coinciding with the rise of 'classical' structuralism in europe.
structuralism, as implied by its name, focuses on structures and the general laws governing them.
like frye, it tends to analyze individual phenomena as representations of these laws.
however, true structuralism introduces a unique concept absent in frye's work: the idea that the meaning of individual elements within a system derives solely from their relationships with one another.
it's not just about viewing things from a structural standpoint.
it's possible to analyze a poem as a 'structure' while still assigning significance to each element within it.
for example, a poem might feature an image of the sun alongside one of the moon, and the focus could be on how these two images interact to create a cohesive structure.
to exemplify, envision a narrative where a boy departs from his house following an altercation with his father.
he wanders into a forest during the daytime, stumbling and plummeting into a deep pit.
the father embarks on a quest to find his son, gazes into the abyss, but is initially unable to spot him amidst the darkness.
suddenly, as the sun ascends to its zenith, its light penetrates the pit and reveals the boy's whereabouts, facilitating the father in rescuing him.
subsequently, a jubilant reunion unfolds, and they make their way back home in unison.
the elements of a story, such as a father and son or a pit and sun, can be replaced with different elements, like a mother and daughter, bird and mole, while still maintaining the same narrative.
it is crucial to maintain the relational structure between the elements.
however, psychoanalytical or humanist interpretations of the story rely on the specific intrinsic significance of these elements, requiring an understanding beyond the text itself.
while the sun being high and pits low may matter to some extent, the narrative structure can accommodate a wide range of symbolic mediators, from a grasshopper to a waterfall.
the relationships among the various elements in the story can be characterized by parallelism, opposition, inversion, equivalence, and other forms.
as long as these internal relationships remain consistent, the individual components are interchangeable.
three additional observations can be made about this approach.
firstly, structuralism is unconcerned with whether the story is considered a masterpiece of literature.
the method is impartial to the cultural significance of the material, accepting anything from a classic like "war and peace" to a more modest work like the "war cry." it is analytical rather than judgmental.
secondly, structuralism challenges conventional wisdom by rejecting the apparent meanings of a narrative and focusing on uncovering underlying "deep" structures that may not be immediately evident.
it does not take the text literally but transforms it into a different type of object.
thirdly, if the specific contents of the text are exchangeable, one could argue that the structure itself constitutes the "content" of the narrative.
saussure's linguistic theories had a significant impact on the russian formalists.
despite not aligning precisely with structuralism, formalism approaches literary works from a structural perspective, focusing on the sign itself rather than its referent.
this approach does not emphasize meaning as differential or delve deeply into the underlying laws and structures of literary texts.
a key figure in this movement was linguist roman jakobson, who bridged the gap between formalism and contemporary structuralism.
jakobson led the moscow linguistic circle, a formalist group established in 1915, and later played a prominent role in czech structuralism after relocating to prague in 1920.
the prague linguistic circle, founded in 1926 and active until the outbreak of world war ii, furthered the development of these ideas.
jakobson subsequently moved to the united states, where his interactions with french anthropologist claude levi-strauss during the war contributed significantly to the evolution of modern structuralist thought.
jakobson's extensive impact is evident across formalism, czech structuralism, and modern linguistics.
specifically, his contribution to poetics, a domain he integrated into linguistics, emphasized that the essence of the 'poetic' lay in language establishing a self-aware connection with itself.
the poetic utilization of language serves to enhance the tangibility of signs, highlighting their material attributes instead of merely utilizing them as tools for communication.
in the realm of the 'poetic', the sign becomes detached from its conventional referent, disrupting the standard sign-referent relationship and granting the sign a certain autonomy as a valuable entity in its own right.
according to jakobson, all communication is comprised of six components: a sender, a receiver, a message transmitted between them, a mutual code facilitating message comprehension, a physical mode of communication termed 'contact', and a 'context' contextualizing the message.
jakobson also emphasizes a crucial distinction outlined by saussure between the metaphorical and the metonymic.
in metaphor, one sign is substituted for another because of a perceived similarity: for example, 'passion' is likened to 'flame.' in metonymy, signs are linked through association: for instance, 'wing' is associated with 'aircraft' due to their inherent connection, and 'sky' with 'aircraft' due to physical proximity.
the ability to create metaphors stems from having a pool of equivalent signs like 'passion,' 'flame,' and 'love.' when speaking or writing, we choose signs from this pool of equivalences and combine them to form coherent sentences.
poetry, on the other hand, not only involves selecting signs but also focuses on combining words that are equivalent in meaning, rhythm, sound, or other aspects.
this is why jakobson famously states that 'the poetic function extends the principle of equivalence from the selection process to the combination process.' jakobson, jan mukarovsky, felix vodicka, and other scholars marked a significant shift from formalism to modern structuralism.
they expanded on the formalists' ideas but integrated them more cohesively within the saussurean linguistic framework.
they proposed that poems should be seen as 'functional structures', where signifiers and signifieds are determined by a complex set of relationships.
the signs within these structures were to be examined independently, distinct from any external reality, drawing upon saussure's emphasis on the arbitrary connection between signs and referents.
this detachment of the text from its context aimed to create an independent entity.
however, the concept of 'defamiliarization' from formalism still linked literary works to the real world.
defamiliarization aimed to disrupt conventional sign systems, drawing attention to the mechanics of language and refreshing our perceptions.
by not accepting language passively, this approach suggested a shift in consciousness.
with the emergence of the prague school, the term 'structuralism' became closely intertwined with 'semiotics'.
'semiotics', also known as 'semiology', refers to the systematic examination of signs, which is the primary focus of literary structuralists.
'structuralism' itself represents an investigative approach that can be employed across various subjects, ranging from soccer games to economic production methods.
on the other hand, 'semiotics' pertains to a specific field of study that encompasses systems typically recognized as signs, such as poems, animal sounds, traffic signals, medical indications, and more.
despite the distinction, there is an overlap between the two terms, as structuralism analyzes entities not conventionally seen as sign systems, viewing them through a structuralist lens, while semiotics frequently utilizes structuralist techniques.
the potential to juxtapose any two words based on similar features is virtually boundless.
each word in the text forms connections with multiple other words through various formal structures, leading to its meaning being intricately 'overdetermined' by a combination of diverse influences.
words can relate to each other through assonance, syntactical equivalence, morphological parallelism, and other means.
consequently, each sign is involved in numerous 'paradigmatic patterns' or systems simultaneously, further complicated by the 'syntagmatic' chains of association, characterized by 'lateral' rather than 'vertical' structures where signs are positioned.
lotman considers poetic text as a complex 'system of systems', interconnecting various elements.
each system within the text contains its tensions, parallelisms, repetitions, and oppositions, constantly influencing one another.
a poem requires multiple readings as some structures are only noticeable in hindsight.
poetry involves activating the full potential of language, pushing words to their limits within the context of surrounding words.
perceiving meaning in a text relies on contrasting and differentiating elements; what is absent can also carry significance.
for instance, the absence of expected devices like rhyme or a happy ending can convey meaning, known as a 'minus device' according to lotman.
lotman values the intricate language used in poetry but rejects the idea that poetry or literature can be solely defined by their linguistic characteristics.
he believes that a text's meaning goes beyond its internal elements and is shaped by its connection to broader systems of meaning, other texts, codes, and societal norms.
the interpretation of a text is influenced by the reader's perspective and expectations, which aligns with reception theory.
lotman emphasizes that readers, guided by specific receptive codes, interpret elements in a work as devices based on their individual backgrounds, rather than these devices being inherent.
something identified as a poetic device by one person could be considered ordinary speech by another.
the evolution of literary criticism has significantly progressed since the era when readers merely appreciated the beauty of imagery.
semiotics now epitomizes literary analysis infused with structural linguistics, transforming it into a methodical and less subjective pursuit.
this refined approach, as evidenced by lotman's contributions, demonstrates a heightened sensitivity to the intricate forms and language nuances compared to conventional criticism.
structuralism not only reshaped the exploration of poetry but also revolutionized the examination of narratives.
this revolution gave rise to a novel literary discipline known as narratology, with key figures including a.
greimas from lithuania, tzvetan todorov from bulgaria, and french critics gerard genette, claude bremond, and roland barthes.
the contemporary structuralist interpretation of narratives traces back to the groundbreaking analysis of myths by claude levi-strauss, who construed seemingly distinct myths as variations of fundamental themes.
according to levi-strauss, totemic and kinship systems can be seen as networks of communication rather than just social or religious foundations.
these systems function as codes that enable the transmission of symbolic 'messages'.
the individual human mind is not the primary thinker behind these structures; instead, myths are deemed to think themselves through people, rather than the other way around.
they do not have their origins in a specific consciousness, nor do they have specific goals in mind.
consequently, one of the implications of structuralism is the de-emphasis of the importance of the individual as the sole source or purpose of meaning.
myths are believed to possess a quasi-objective collective existence, predetermined by their own 'concrete logic' regardless of individual thought processes, reducing individual consciousnesses to mere functions of the myths themselves.
every narrative in the decameron can be interpreted as an elaborate sentence that merges various components in unique configurations.
the text delves into its own quasi-linguistic framework, with structuralism suggesting that every piece of literature, while ostensibly narrating external events, also subtly reflects on its own creative methodology.
structuralism, ultimately, not only reevaluates concepts through the lens of language but also regards language as its fundamental focus of analysis.
the structuralist approach raised doubts about literature's claim to unique discourse, suggesting that deep structures found in works by mickey spillane were comparable to those in sir philip sidney's works.
as a result, it became challenging to uphold literature's privileged ontological status.
the emergence of structuralism signaled a shift in european literary scholarship, overshadowing the prominence of esteemed aestheticians and humanist scholars of the twentieth century such as croce, curtius, auerbach, spitzer, and wellek.
these scholars, known for their erudition, insight, and cosmopolitan references, were now seen as luminaries of a pre-turmoil european humanism.
the focus on structuralism highlighting the constructed nature of human meaning was a significant development.
it challenged the notion that meaning was individual or predetermined by divine forces, showing instead that it arose from shared systems of signification.
this standpoint undercut the confident belief of the bourgeoisie that meaning originated solely from isolated individuals, revealing that language existed prior to individuals and influenced them more than they influenced it.
understanding meaning was not a simple, innate process but rather shaped by the languages one had access to, which were not fixed or universal.
meaning was not universally shared and then expressed in different languages; rather, what one could express depended on the languages they were exposed to initially.
these ideas laid the groundwork for a social and historical theory of meaning that deeply influenced contemporary thinking.
language did not merely mirror reality but actively shaped it: it was a specific method of defining the world that heavily relied on the symbolic systems available to us, or rather, that had a hold over us.
consequently, doubts started to emerge that structuralism, rather than being a form of empiricism, was another variant of philosophical idealism.
its perspective that reality is fundamentally constructed by language was seen as a modern rendition of the traditional belief that the world is determined by human consciousness.
the literary establishment was scandalized by structuralism due to its disregard for the individual, its clinical analysis of literary mysteries, and its apparent contradiction with common sense.
the notion that structuralism challenges common sense has actually been viewed as a positive aspect of the approach.
common sense typically asserts that objects have one clear meaning, readily apparent on their surface.
it assumes that our perception of the world is straightforward and accurate.
for example, the sun is believed to revolve around the earth because it appears that way.
however, throughout history, common sense has supported actions like burning witches, hanging sheep-stealers, and avoiding jews based on unfounded fears, despite claiming to be unchanging across time.
historically, thinkers challenging the notion that apparent meanings represent true meanings have faced criticism.
this trend has included copernicus, followed by marx, who argued that the genuine significance of social processes operated covertly from individual awareness.
building upon marx's ideas, freud proposed that the authentic meanings behind our words and actions often elude conscious comprehension.
today, structuralism continues this tradition, suggesting a disconnect between reality and our perception of it.
this challenges individuals seeking to maintain control and imposing singular interpretations on the world.
such ideas also confront the empirical views of literary humanists, who prioritize personal experiences as the ultimate reality within literature.
freud's work further highlights that even our most personal encounters are influenced by underlying structures.
the principles of structuralism can be succinctly described as alarmingly ahistorical; it aimed to identify similarities, contrasts, and shifts at a level of abstraction far removed from the specific nuances of human history.
adopting this aloof perspective, all intellects appeared quite similar.
after outlining the fundamental rule systems of a literary work, all a structuralist could do was ponder what steps to take next.
connecting the piece to the contexts it addressed, the circumstances under which it was created, or the real readers analyzing it was out of the question, as structuralism's founding principle was to set aside these realities.
in order to delve into the essence of language, saussure initially needed to overlook or disregard the referent - the tangible object indicated by the sign.
by temporarily setting aside the real object, he could focus more closely on analyzing the structure of the sign itself.
it is interesting to note the similarity of this approach to husserl's concept of bracketing the real object to better understand the way the mind perceives it.
despite the fundamental differences between structuralism and phenomenology, both emerge from the paradoxical act of excluding the physical world to illuminate our awareness of it.
for those who view consciousness as intricately linked to our practical interactions with reality, such a strategy is considered counterproductive.
it is akin to sacrificing a person to facilitate a more convenient study of blood circulation.
it wasn't merely about excluding something as broad as "the world"; rather, it was about finding some semblance of certainty in a specific world where certainty was elusive.
saussure's course in general linguistics comprises lectures given in europe between 1907 and 1911, a period just before a significant historical upheaval that saussure did not witness.
it was during these years that husserl was shaping the fundamental tenets of phenomenology, not far from saussure's base in geneva.
concurrently or shortly after, influential english writers such as yeats, eliot, pound, lawrence, and joyce were constructing intricate symbolic systems rooted in tradition, theosophy, masculine and feminine principles, medievalism, and mythology.
these systems aimed to serve as comprehensive "synchronic" frameworks, offering exhaustive models to understand and govern historical reality.
saussure, in turn, introduced the concept of a "collective consciousness" as a foundation for the langue system.
saussure examined the evolution of language as a series of synchronic systems succeeding one another.
he drew a comparison to a vatican official's perspective, noting that regardless of whether the pope's upcoming statement on birth control reaffirmed past doctrine or not, the church would transition from one state of certainty to another.
according to saussure, historical transformations affected individual language elements, indirectly influencing the language as a whole.
the language would then readjust to accommodate these disruptions, akin to adapting to a new situation like having a wooden leg or, as in eliot's tradition, embracing a new masterpiece in its circle.
this linguistic model reveals a specific belief about human society: change represents a disturbance in an otherwise harmonious system, which momentarily falters, regains equilibrium, and assimilates the change seamlessly.
for saussure, linguistic change is viewed as accidental, occurring "blindly," with subsequent formalists later elucidating how systematic understanding of change could be achieved.
jakobson and his associate yury tynyanov regarded the history of literature as constituting a system in which certain forms and genres are either dominant or subordinate at any given time.
evolution in literature occurs through shifts within this hierarchy, causing a shift in dominance from one form to another, and vice versa.
the driving force behind this process is "defamiliarization": when a once-dominant literary form becomes stale and perceptibly merges with a sub-genre, such as popular journalism, a formerly subordinate form emerges to "defamiliarize" the status quo.
historical change involves the gradual realignment of established elements within the system, where nothing vanishes but rather transforms by adapting its relationships with other components.
structuralism challenged traditional literary criticism on various fronts but was still entwined with some of its elements.
its emphasis on language was groundbreaking, yet it also aligned with the typical focus of scholars.
the fixation on language raised questions about other important aspects like work, sexuality, and power.
although these realities could be intertwined with discourse, they couldn't be simplified to it alone.
the extreme emphasis on language was influenced by political circumstances.
the view of literary text as a closed system by structuralists resembled the new critical approach of treating it as an isolated entity.
the shift from literature as a social practice to a mere product was concerning.
structuralism could analyze the product but avoided exploring the material aspects of its creation to dodge the myth of an 'origin.' the structuralists did not show concerns about how literary products were consumed or the actual reading experience of individuals, or the social functions of literature.
some critics argued that structuralism emphasized the holistic nature of sign-systems, which resembled the concept of 'organic unity'.
levi-strauss viewed myths as fictional resolutions of real social conflicts, lotman used cybernetics to illustrate how a poem formed a sophisticated organic whole, and the prague school adopted a 'functionalist' perspective in which all elements of a work collaborated for the benefit of the entirety.
unlike traditional criticism that often viewed literary works as mere reflections of the author's mind, structuralism proposed that they were windows to universal themes.
there was a risk that the focus on the text's materiality and detailed linguistic processes could be overlooked, as the 'surface' of a written piece was considered merely a superficial reflection of its deeper meanings.
according to the humanist tradition, creating meaning is something that individuals create or collectively establish.
however, the existence of predefined rules governing this creation of meaning raises questions about how this process could occur without a preexisting framework.
regardless of how far back one traces this search for the origin of meaning, a foundational structure is always found to be in place.
this structure was not solely a product of spoken language, as coherent speech itself relies on it.
the idea of identifying the 'first sign' as the starting point is challenged by saussure, who asserts that one sign necessarily references another, creating a chain of signification.
speculating on the birth of language, levi-strauss proposes that if language did emerge, it would have done so suddenly.
connecting this to roman jakobson's communicative model, which highlights the addresser as the message's source, prompts consideration of the origin of this addresser.
transmitting a message implies an existing engagement with and constitution by language.
this concept echoes the notion that language is fundamental, as famously stated: "in the beginning was the word." in a practical scenario, words may appear to retain their literal meanings regardless of any whims i might have.
consider a situation where i request you to close a door after having just tied you to a chair for twenty minutes.
what if the door is already shut or doesn't even exist?
in such cases, it would be reasonable for you to question my intent by asking, "what do you mean?" the issue is not about your comprehension of my words' definitions but rather grasping my underlying intentions.
merely providing a dictionary wouldn't resolve the confusion.
asking "what do you mean?" in this context delves into deciphering the motives of the speaker, and without this understanding, the directive to close the door lacks significant meaning.
inquiring about my intentions does not necessarily involve delving into my thoughts or scrutinizing the mental processes occurring within me.
it is not essential to perceive intentions as e.
hirsch does, viewing them as inherently private 'mental acts'.
when asking 'what do you mean?' in such a scenario, one is essentially inquiring about the purposes my language aims to fulfill: it serves as a means to comprehend the situation at hand, rather than an effort to tap into mysterious impulses inside my mind.
comprehending my intention entails understanding my speech and actions within a meaningful context.
when we comprehend the 'intentions' behind language, we interpret it as being directed, designed to achieve specific outcomes; and all of this is intertwined with the practical circumstances in which the language is used.
it involves perceiving language as a practice rather than an entity; and naturally, practices do not exist without human agents.
the transition away from structuralism can be seen as a shift from 'language' to 'discourse', as defined by french linguist emile benveniste.
'language' is understood as speech or writing observed 'objectively', treated as a series of signs devoid of a subject.
on the other hand, 'discourse' refers to language perceived as communication, involving both the speakers and writers as well as, potentially, the readers or listeners.
this shift does not signify a regression to the pre-structuralist era where language was considered individually owned like our personal belongings.
it also does not hark back to the traditional 'contractual' concept of language, whereby language was merely a tool used by isolated individuals to trade their experiences.
this antiquated viewpoint treated language as a 'market commodity', closely linked with the rise of bourgeois individualism, where meaning was akin to a possession that could be traded like any other item, using words as currency.
the empiricist theory of language posed a significant challenge in determining the authenticity of exchanged concepts.
when one person attached a verbal sign to a concept and communicated it to another, there was uncertainty about whether the receiver interpreted it similarly.
this scenario led to potential misunderstandings among individuals.
laurence sterne explored this concept humorously in his novel, tristram shandy, during a time when empiricism was the prevailing philosophical perspective on language in england.
critics of structuralism did not entertain the idea of reverting to this approach where signs were related to concepts instead of discussing concepts as unique methods of handling signs.
the theory's emphasis on meaning devoid of the human element was a puzzling aspect to many.
in 1962, roman jakobson and claude levi-strauss published an influential analysis of charles baudelaire's poem "les chats," which has since become a cornerstone of high structuralist methodology.
the essay meticulously uncovered a series of equivalences and oppositions within the poem's semantic, syntactic, and phonological layers, delving all the way down to individual phonemes.
however, michael riffaterre later pointed out in a well-known response to this analysis that certain structures identified by jakobson and levi-strauss would have been too subtle for even the most attentive reader to discern.
additionally, the analysis overlooked the process of reading itself, treating the text as a static object in space rather than a dynamic temporal progression.
the significance of a particular element in a poem can prompt us to reinterpret previously acquired knowledge; repeated words or images carry evolving meanings with each recurrence.
each event is unique because its repetition alters its initial impact.
riffaterre critiques the baudelaire essay for neglecting important connotations of words that can only be understood by considering the cultural and social contexts from which they derive.
this approach, however, is prohibited by the structuralist beliefs held by the authors.
while the authors analyze the poem purely as 'language' in alignment with structuralist principles, riffaterre's angle considers the reading process and the cultural environment in which the work is interpreted, viewing it more as 'discourse'.
exploring the significance of a sign meant delving into its complex history, shaped by diverse social groups, classes, individuals, and discourses aiming to claim it and assign their own interpretations.
language, in essence, was a battleground of ideologies rather than a rigid structure; signs were the tangible channels of ideology, as values and ideas relied on them for existence.
bakhtin recognized the autonomy of language to some extent, acknowledging that it was not merely a reflection of social agendas.
however, he emphasized that all language was intertwined with specific social dynamics within larger political, ideological, and economic frameworks.
words were described as 'multi-accentual' rather than having fixed meanings, representing the communication between specific human subjects.
this context influenced and altered the words' meanings.
bakhtin's language theory suggested that all signs, being as material as bodies or cars, were indispensable to human consciousness.
this concept formed the basis for a materialist view of consciousness.
human consciousness, according to bakhtin, involved active, material, and semiotic interactions with others, rather than being isolated from external relationships.
it encompassed both internal and external realms simultaneously, much like language.
rather than being viewed as mere expression, reflection, or an abstract system, language was considered a material tool for creating meanings.
through social conflict and dialogue, the material embodiment of signs was transformed into significance.
speech act theory has inherent issues, both intrinsically and as a literary framework.
it is uncertain whether this theory can entirely refrain from incorporating the traditional 'intending subject' of phenomenology to establish its foundations.
its focus on language appears excessively legalistic, revolving around the permissions of who can communicate what to whom under particular circumstances.
austin's examination targets "the total speech act in the total speech situation," yet bakhtin reveals that these acts and situations involve complexities beyond what speech act theory acknowledges.
moreover, it is risky to use real-life speech instances as blueprints for literature because literary works are not direct speech acts; for instance, flaubert's words in a text do not constitute a direct conversation with the reader.
instead, literary texts can be viewed as mimicking or virtual speech acts that austin himself somewhat disregarded as 'non-serious' and flawed.
it is a form of language that has been disconnected from any specific real-time connection and, as a result, is open to being interpreted and reinterpreted by numerous readers.
the piece cannot predict its own future interpretations and lacks the ability to manage or restrict these readings, unlike what can be done in direct conversations.
its anonymity is inherent in its form, rather than being an unfortunate circumstance thrust upon it.
thus, the notion of being an "author" who is the "origin" of one's own meanings, possessing "authority" over them, is considered a myth in this context.
viewing the connection between language and human subjectivity in this manner aligns with the structuralists' approach in steering clear of what is termed the 'humanist' error - the simplistic belief that a literary work is merely a transcription of a real person speaking to us.
this perspective on literature often identifies its defining feature as its written form, which can be unsettling: the printed words, with their impersonal nature, serve as a barrier between us and the author.
the yearning to have a direct conversation with cervantes showcases a desire to strip away the material essence of literature and transform it into a personal, spiritual interaction between living individuals.
this perspective is associated with a liberal humanistic skepticism towards anything that cannot be immediately linked to interpersonal relationships, ranging from feminism to industrial production.
overall, it does not prioritize acknowledging the literary work as a textual entity.
however, while structuralism aimed to avoid the humanist fallacy, it inadvertently fell into the trap of essentially erasing human presence altogether.
according to the structuralists, the 'ideal reader' of a text should possess all the necessary codes to fully comprehend it.
they envisioned this reader as a mere reflection of the text itself, interpreting it exactly as intended.
the ideal reader would be equipped with the technical knowledge essential for decoding the text flawlessly, devoid of any biases or constraints.
in its extreme interpretation, this reader would be void of nationality, class, gender, ethnicity, or cultural preconceptions.
although such an ideal reader is practically non-existent, the structuralists acknowledged that its existence in reality was not a prerequisite.
structuralism, a branch of literary theory, is viewed as another failed attempt to supplant religion with a modern substitute, such as the revered concept of science.
the pursuit of a wholly objective interpretation of literary pieces presents significant challenges, as complete eradication of interpretation and subjectivity appears unattainable, even in the most meticulously objective analysis.
how, for instance, could a structuralist pinpoint the various 'signifying units' within a text without relying on cultural assumptions that strict structuralism sought to avoid?
bakhtin argues that language, being a product of social interaction, inherently carries connotations and judgments.
in essence, the words we choose not only indicate objects but also suggest our attitudes towards them, as illustrated by the tone used in common phrases like 'pass the cheese.' structuralism acknowledged that language operated in a "connotative" realm, yet it downplayed the significance of this aspect.
it tended to shy away from offering full assessments in a broader context, refraining from categorizing literary works as good, bad, or mediocre.
this reluctance stemmed from a desire to adhere to scientific principles and a rejection of the flowery language associated with traditional literature criticism.
therefore, in principle, a structuralist could dedicate their entire career to analyzing mundane items like bus tickets, as the field provided no guidance on what should be deemed important.
the restrained nature of structuralism's avoidance of value judgments, akin to the prudishness found in behaviorist psychology, illustrated more than just a methodological choice.
it hinted at how structuralism had become ensnared in a detached approach to scientific methodology, a concept that wielded significant influence in the late stages of capitalist society.
in middle-class suburbs, only ideas deemed acceptable are granted approval, while less affluent notions are swiftly dismissed.
some critiques have been incisive, nuanced, and constructive, marking a considerable advancement in england compared to the past and showcasing an intellectual boldness reminiscent of the scrutiny era.
the analysis of texts has been notably logical and rigorous, blending french structuralism with an english sensibility for language effectively.
however, the overly selective nature of its structuralism approach, often overlooked, should be emphasized.
when we focus on studying the 'literary system' instead of individual 'literary works,' delving into the entire framework of codes, genres, and conventions that help us recognize and interpret literature, we reveal a more substantial subject for investigation.
this perspective transforms literary criticism into metacriticism—shifting its role from primarily offering interpretative or evaluative judgments to stepping back and examining the underlying logic of such judgments.
it involves analyzing the codes and models we employ when making these statements.
jonathan culler argues that engaging in the study of literature is not merely about producing another interpretation of a specific work like king lear but about enhancing our understanding of the conventions and mechanisms of an institution, a form of discourse.
structuralism serves to elevate the literary institution by providing it with a more respectable and compelling purpose, surpassing mere poetic sentiments about nature.
could a study of literature potentially incite students to question the established set of conventions and procedures, or is it more likely to suggest that these constitute a fundamental technical knowledge that every literature student should possess?
is there a singular type of competency, and by whose standards should one measure it?
it is conceivable that a person lacking traditional 'literary competence', who disregards established hermeneutical methods and instead subverts them, could offer a profoundly insightful interpretation of a poem.
a reading should not automatically be deemed 'incompetent' solely for not adhering to conventional critical norms; rather, some readings may be deemed incompetent for mechanically conforming to such norms.
furthermore, evaluating 'competence' becomes even more complex when considering how literary analysis intertwines with values, beliefs, and assumptions that extend beyond the literary domain.
literary works are considered both 'code productive' and 'code-transgressive' in addition to being 'code-confirming', offering us opportunities to learn novel ways of interpreting texts rather than simply reinforcing our existing approaches.
the notion of an 'ideal' or 'competent' reader is fixed and fails to acknowledge that assessments of 'competence' are culturally and ideologically dependent.
all reading is influenced by external assumptions, for which 'competence' is an insufficient measure.
at a technical level, the concept of competence is inherently limited.
a competent reader is defined by the ability to apply certain rules to a text, but the process of applying these rules raises a fundamental question – what are the rules for applying rules?
rules typically act as guides, akin to a pointing finger, directing us on a path of interpretation that leads us to focus on the intended object rather than the mechanism itself.
however, pointing and rule application are not straightforward activities, as rules do not explicitly dictate their application; if they did, they would cease to be rules.
following rules requires a degree of creative interpretation, making it challenging to determine if one is applying a rule in the same manner as another person, or even if the rules being applied are the same at all.
the process of applying a rule goes beyond mere technicality as it is interconnected with broader interpretations of reality, personal commitments, and preferences that cannot be solely attributed to adhering to a specific rule.
for instance, if the rule involves identifying parallelisms in a poem, the interpretation of what qualifies as a parallelism is subjective.
differing perspectives on what constitutes a parallelism do not signify a violation of the rule, but rather a discrepancy in understanding.
in such cases, resolution typically involves referencing the authority of the literary institution to define and establish the meaning of parallelism.
questioning the rationale behind following a particular rule leads back to the literary institution's authority, indicating that certain practices are upheld based on tradition and convention.
despite this, one could argue for alternative approaches.
arguments based on the rules dictating competence or the text itself may not prove effective, as there are numerous ways to engage with a text creatively.
it's not about being 'anarchistic,' in the stereotypical sense.
an anarchist, in general terms, is not just someone who disregards rules but someone who consistently challenges and bypasses rules.
by questioning the actions of the literary establishment, you are not conforming to typical norms.
while i may argue against this for various reasons, i cannot simply dismiss it by citing 'competence,' as that is exactly what is being debated.
structuralism might analyze and endorse current practices, but what response does it offer to those who propose doing things differently?
as we recall from saussure's theory, he posits that meaning in language primarily exists through distinctions.
for instance, the word 'cat' holds its meaning because it is distinct from 'cap' or 'bat'.
however, the question arises of how extensively one should apply this differentiation process.
'cat' is also defined by what it is not, like 'cad' or 'mat', and 'mat', in turn, is identified by not being 'map' or 'hat'.
this chain of distinctions seems potentially endless.
if each sign derives its meaning from being different from all other signs, then every sign could seemingly consist of an infinite web of distinctions.
consequently, determining the definition of a sign appears to be a more intricate task than initially perceived.
while saussure's concept of langue implies a structured system of meaning, the challenge lies in deciding where to set the boundaries within language.
another way to express our previous point is that meaning is not inherently contained within a sign.
as the meaning of a sign is dependent on what the sign represents, it is inherently lacking within the sign itself.
meaning is intricately woven throughout the entire network of signifiers, making it challenging to pinpoint conclusively.
it exists as a continuous interplay of presence and absence rather than being fully contained within any single sign, much like following the ever-shifting connections between signifiers.
interpreting a text is more akin to observing a flickering light than simply counting beads on a necklace.
furthermore, due to the temporal nature of language, we can never entirely grasp or confine meaning, as it is constantly evolving.
as i delve into the significance of a sentence, its essence always appears to be in limbo, as if in a state of suspension, yet hinting at a continuation or further revelation.
each word leads me to another in a chain of signifiers, older meanings evolving through new ones.
even when a sentence concludes, the infinite capacity of language persists.
meaning resides not merely in stacking words together mechanically; for language to yield a semblance of coherence, each word must encapsulate echoes of its predecessors and remain receptive to echoes of those about to follow.
every element in the web of meaning bears the imprint of others, forming an intricate fabric that never ceases to unfurl.
in this light, no sign is ever entirely pristine or complete in meaning.
one way in which meaning is never exactly the same is that signs must always be repeatable or reproducible.
a 'sign' is not considered as such if it only appears once.
the ability of a sign to be replicated is thus essential to its nature; however, it also causes a distinction in its identity because it can be replicated in different contexts altering its interpretation.
determining the original meaning of a sign or its initial context is challenging as we often encounter it in various situations.
while a sign must exhibit certain consistency across these situations to be recognizable at all, due to its different contexts, it is never entirely consistent with itself.
for example, the term 'cat' can refer to a furry four-legged creature, a malicious person, a knotted whip, an american, a horizontal beam for lifting a ship's anchor, a six-legged tripod, a short tapered stick, and so forth.
all of this suggests that language is not as stable as the classical structuralists believed it to be.
instead of a clearly defined structure with symmetrical units of signifiers and signifieds, language appears to be a vast, boundless web where elements constantly interact and circulate.
none of these elements can be strictly defined, and everything is interconnected and influenced by everything else.
this challenges traditional theories of meaning, which posited that signs reflected internal experiences or real-world objects, enabling the expression of thoughts, feelings, or descriptions of reality.
as we have previously discussed the limitations of this notion of 'representation' in structuralism, further complexities now come to light.
one way i could convince myself of the feasibility is by focusing on my spoken words instead of putting my thoughts on paper.
speaking makes me feel a unique connection with myself compared to writing.
when i speak, my words feel like they are immediately present in my mind, and my voice acts as a personal and spontaneous conduit for them.
on the other hand, writing poses a challenge as my intended meanings can sometimes slip away from my grasp.
i entrust my ideas to the impersonal realm of print, and as a result, a written text gains a lasting, tangible form that can be shared, duplicated, referenced, and utilized in unforeseen ways.
writing appears to diminish my authenticity, as it functions as a mediated form of expression, a dull and automated replication of speech, always one step removed from my direct consciousness.
throughout the western philosophical tradition, from plato to levi-strauss, there has been a consistent tendency to criticize writing as a soulless, detached mode of communication, while simultaneously praising the vitality of spoken language.
this bias stems from a specific notion of humanity: the belief that individuals possess the innate ability to generate and convey their own meanings spontaneously, fully understand themselves, and wield language as a clear reflection of their true selves.
overlooked in this perspective is the fact that the "living voice" is essentially as tangible as written text, and that both spoken and written language rely on differentiation and segmentation to function.
consequently, speaking can be considered a form of writing just as much as writing can be perceived as a derivative of speaking.
every concept is entangled in an endless interplay of meanings, imbued with hints and remnants of other thoughts.
within this web of symbols, particular interpretations are esteemed by societal beliefs, becoming pivotal points around which other interpretations revolve.
take, for instance, the notions of freedom, family, democracy, independence, authority, order, and so forth in our society.
occasionally, these interpretations are viewed as the roots of all others, the wellspring from which they derive; however, as we have observed, this notion is rather peculiar, for such interpretations could only have arisen if other symbols preexisted.
it proves challenging to ponder an origin without feeling the urge to trace back even further.
alternatively, these interpretations might be regarded not as the source but as the destination, towards which all other meanings are, or should be, steadily progressing.
a theory of history or language characterized by a straightforward linear progression overlooks the intricate network of signs i have discussed.
this complexity involves the dynamic interplay of presence and absence, as language evolves not just forward but also sideways.
post-structuralism identifies this intricate complexity as the essence of a "text." french philosopher jacques derrida criticizes any philosophical system that relies on an unquestionable foundation, a fundamental principle, or a secure ground as 'metaphysical.' derrida acknowledges that the impulse to establish such first principles is ingrained in human history and cannot be easily eliminated.
although he recognizes that his own work is inevitably influenced by metaphysical thinking, he attempts to distance himself from it.
derrida argues that these foundational principles can always be examined and 'deconstructed,' revealing them to be constructs of a specific system of meaning rather than self-sustaining truths.
such first principles are often characterized by what they exclude and are associated with the binary opposition commonly found in structuralism.
the term 'deconstruction' refers to a critical operation that challenges established oppositions, revealing how they can undermine each other within textual discourse.
in this context, woman is depicted as the "other" of man, positioned as non-male and associated with a negative value in contrast to the dominant male paradigm.
conversely, man's identity is constructed in opposition to woman, relying on defining himself in relation to this perceived opposite, thus placing his very essence at risk.
woman is not merely a distant other but a closely connected figure, embodying what man is not and serving as a crucial reminder of his own identity.
therefore, man inevitably requires this counterpart even as he rejects it, compelled to assign a clear definition to what he perceives as nothingness.
his own existence not only relies parasitically on the presence of a woman and on the practice of excluding and dominating her, but one explanation for why such exclusion becomes imperative is the possibility that she might not be as distant as he imagines.
it is likely that she represents an aspect within man himself that he must suppress, expel from within his own existence, confining it to a distinctly foreign realm outside his established boundaries.
it is plausible that what lies outside is also present within, the foreign also familiar, prompting man to rigorously patrol the absolute divide between these two realms as diligently as he does because it is constantly susceptible to violation, has indeed been breached before, and is far less rigid than it seems.
derrida's customary approach to reading involves focusing on seemingly insignificant parts of a text, such as footnotes, recurring minor elements, or passing references, and meticulously exploring them until they challenge the binary oppositions that shape the entire text.
the method of deconstructive criticism aims to reveal how texts expose flaws in their own logical frameworks; deconstruction achieves this by examining key 'symptomatic' junctures, the moments of uncertainty or meaning breakdown where texts falter, reveal inconsistencies, or imply self-contradiction.
this assertion goes beyond merely observing certain writing styles; it presents a universal claim concerning the inherent nature of writing.
if the theory of signification discussed at the start of this chapter holds true, then there exists an element within writing itself that ultimately transcends all established systems and logical frameworks.
there is a continuous flux, overflow, and dispersion of meaning, referred to by derrida as 'dissemination,' that eludes easy classification within the textual structure or through traditional critical approaches.
writing, like any form of language, operates on the basis of differentiation; however, differentiation is not a concept that can be easily grasped or formulated.
a piece of text might indirectly reveal insights into the essence of meaning and signification that it cannot explicitly articulate.
from derrida's perspective, all forms of language exhibit this surplus beyond precise meaning, constantly on the verge of exceeding the boundaries of the intended sense.
the emergence of the concept of writing challenges the very notion of structure because structures typically assume a central point, a fixed foundation, a hierarchy of meanings, and a solid basis, all of which writing disrupts with its continuous variations and delays.
this shift signifies a transition from structuralism to post-structuralism, a form of thinking that incorporates derrida's deconstructive processes, the contributions of the french historian michel foucault, the theories of the french psychoanalyst jacques lacan, and the insights of the feminist philosopher and critic julia kristeva.
although foucault's work is not explicitly addressed in this book, its pervasive influence is undeniable in shaping the concluding remarks.
barthes explores the theme of language extensively, focusing on saussure's belief that signs are shaped by historical and cultural conventions.
barthes identifies a "healthy" sign as one that acknowledges its own arbitrariness instead of pretending to be natural.
he asserts that such signs reveal their relative, artificial nature while conveying meaning.
barthes's earlier work ties this concept to a political agenda, arguing that signs claiming to be natural serve to perpetuate ideologies that seek to portray social constructs as immutable as nature.
by blurring the lines between culture and nature, these ideologies promote the acceptance of certain beliefs and behaviors, such as venerating a flag or equating western democracy with the essence of freedom, as natural and unquestionable responses.
barthes views the realist or representational sign as inherently problematic.
it disguises itself as a direct representation of reality, obscuring its nature as a sign.
the conventional view of a sign as a 'reflection,' 'expression,' or 'representation' overlooks the creative element of language.
it fails to acknowledge that our perception of the world is shaped by the language we use to interpret it, implying that what we define as 'real' is intertwined with the flexible nature of our systems of meaning.
barthes's concept of the 'double' sign, which acknowledges its own material form while conveying a message, is influenced by the formalists and czech structuralists, and reminiscent of jakobson's 'poetic' word that highlights its linguistic essence.
this 'double' sign can be traced back to the strategies of estrangement in language employed by socialist artists of the german weimar republic, such as bertolt brecht, who aimed to achieve political objectives through their work.
the "writable" text, typically associated with modernism, lacks a specific meaning or definite signifieds.
instead, it is multifaceted and expansive, presenting an endless array of signifiers that form a complex network of codes and code fragments.
within this intricate tapestry, critics have the freedom to carve out their unique analytical paths.
there is a fluidity to these texts, with no distinct beginnings or endings, and no fixed hierarchy of textual layers dictating significance.
literary works are intertwined with one another, not just through influences but through a more profound process where each word or phrase represents a reinterpretation of previous writings.
the concept of literary originality is challenged, as there is no "first" work, and all literature is interconnected.
consequently, a specific piece of writing transcends clear boundaries, blending seamlessly with surrounding works and offering a myriad of interpretations that extend indefinitely.
the literary movement of modernism played a crucial role in giving rise to structuralist and post-structuralist criticism.
works by barthes and derrida, later in their careers, can be seen as modernist literary texts - experimental, enigmatic, and richly ambiguous.
in post-structuralism, the distinction between 'criticism' and 'creation' blurs as both are encompassed under the umbrella of 'writing' itself.
structuralism emerged as intellectuals became fixated on language, particularly due to the perceived crisis surrounding language in western europe during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
the industrial society led to language being reduced to a mere tool for science, commerce, advertising, and bureaucracy, raising questions about how to write authentically.
in a culture saturated with mass-produced, profit-driven content, who would be the audience for such writing?
could a literary work exist simultaneously as an artistic creation and a marketable commodity?
writing undergoes a deep introspection marked by narcissism, yet it is fraught with the social burden of being deemed purposeless.
while it is unavoidably entangled with those who devalue it as a commodity, it strives to break free from the contamination of societal significance.
this liberation is pursued either through a pursuit of the purity of silence, as seen in the symbolists, or by aiming for a stark neutrality known as a 'degree zero of writing', a facade of innocence that is, in truth, a distinct literary style, as exemplified by hemingway.
it is clear that the guilt referenced by barthes stems from literature itself as an institution, highlighting the divisions within languages and classes.
the text was released five years subsequent to a societal upheaval that profoundly shook the foundational pillars of france's political establishment.
the year 1968 witnessed a surge in student activism that reverberated across europe, protesting the oppressive nature of academic institutions and momentarily challenging the very foundations of the capitalist regime in france.
in a climactic turn of events, the nation hovered on the edge of collapse, as its authorities clashed with protesting students in the streets, who sought to unite with the working class in their struggle.
amid a lack of clear political direction and a tangled mix of socialist ideals, anarchism, and immature behavior, the student movement eventually receded and dispersed.
the working-class movement, failed by its passive stalinist leaders, could not seize power.
in a swift return from exile, charles de gaulle restored order, rallying the french state under the banners of patriotism, legality, and public order.
the described position i have put forward stemmed from a specific political setback and sense of disappointment.
it considered the 'total structure' as its adversary, namely the oppressive state of advanced monopoly capitalism and the complicit stalinist politics that purported to oppose it.
well before post-structuralism emerged, previous generations of socialists had been battling against these dominant systems.
the potential of finding satisfaction in the sensual pleasure of reading or engaging in activities within institutions for the criminally insane was often overlooked as a viable solution, a sentiment shared by the guerrilla fighters of guatemala.
post-structuralism, in one of its iterations, offered a way to avoid grappling with political inquiries.
scholars like derrida called into question traditional concepts of truth, reality, meaning, and knowledge, revealing them as rooted in signifiers that operate in language.
the instabilities of meaning and the fluidity of signifiers raised doubts about the existence of fixed truths.
if reality is shaped by language rather than simply mirrored by it, can we truly comprehend reality itself beyond interpreting our own language?
can we objectively declare one interpretation of reality, history, or text as superior to another?
while hermeneutics has traditionally sought to understand the past empathetically, is there an absolute past to uncover, or is it merely a construct of present discourse?
using terms such as 'truth,' 'certainty,' and the 'real' would often provoke immediate criticism as being metaphysical in some circles.
objecting to the assertion that no knowledge is achievable was interpreted as clinging sentimentally to ideas of absolute truth and having an arrogant belief that one, alongside certain astute natural scientists, could perceive reality exactly as it existed.
despite the scarcity of adherents to such ideologies nowadays, especially among philosophy of science scholars, the skeptics remained undeterred.
the brand of science often mocked by post-structuralism typically aligns with a positivist viewpoint, a variation of the rationalistic assertion from the nineteenth century, which claims to encompass a transcendent and value-neutral understanding of 'the facts.' this portrayal is essentially a misrepresentation.
it does not encompass the full scope of 'science,' and there is no benefit in creating an absolute caricature of scientific introspection.
asserting that the justification for using words such as truth, certainty, and reality does not imply these words are meaningless or ineffective.
grounds for absolute certainty are questioned, posing a challenge to envision what such grounds would entail.
one potential benefit of the belief that we are confined by our own language is the ability to critique others' beliefs without committing to any of our own.
this perspective offers a shielded position, albeit one that is ultimately hollow.
the notion that language's key aspect is its inherent lack of understanding hints at a resigned acceptance of truth's elusive nature with ties to post-1968 disillusionment.
this approach liberates you from the need to take a stance on crucial matters as your commentary on them is merely a result of words and should not be regarded as definitively 'true' or 'serious'.
moreover, this viewpoint can be seen as provocatively revolutionary by challenging others' viewpoints, revealing supposedly significant statements as merely playful symbols, yet paradoxically, it remains deeply traditional in all other aspects.
because it does not require you to assert anything, it is as ineffective as using empty bullets.
according to de man, language is inherently metaphorical, operating through tropes and figures, and no language can be entirely literal.
whether in philosophy, law, political theory, or poetry, language relies on metaphors, making them just as fictional.
as metaphors lack a clear foundation and are merely substitutions of signs, language often reveals its fictitious and arbitrary essence when striving to be most compelling.
in the realm of "literature," this uncertainty is most apparent, leaving readers suspended between literal and figurative meanings, unable to definitively choose.
consequently, readers are plunged into a boundless linguistic abyss by texts that become "unreadable." literary works possess a certain level of clarity when compared to other types of communication as they inherently recognize their rhetorical nature.
they acknowledge the distinction between their stated and actual intentions, operating through figurative language that adds ambiguity and open-endedness.
essentially, they exhibit an ironic quality.
while all forms of writing are equally figurative and open to interpretation, literary works do not pretend to provide absolute truths like other genres.
according to de man and his colleague hillis miller, literature is self-deconstructing and reflects on its own processes, making it inherently self-aware.
the yale critics' textual ambiguities are seen as distinct from the poetic ambivalences explored in new criticism.
rather than aiming to merge two specific interpretations, as the new critics did, the process of reading according to the yale critics involves navigating between two conflicting meanings that cannot be reconciled or dismissed.
this view transforms literary criticism into a somewhat ironic and unsettling endeavor, delving into the inherent emptiness of text, revealing the elusive nature of meaning, the futility of seeking truth, and the deceptive aspects of all forms of discourse.
however, this form of anglo-american deconstruction can be interpreted as a resurgence of traditional new critical formalism, but in a more intensified manner.
while the new critics believed that poetry could indirectly reflect elements of reality beyond the text, deconstructionists argue that literature serves to highlight the inherent limitations of language, suggesting that it can only reflect its own failures rather than convey any definitive truths.
literature is presented as a realm devoid of clear references, a graveyard for communication.
cautious individuals tend to avoid making decisions in unclear situations, which can impact their approach to social and political matters.
literature thrives on ambiguity, making it the perfect example of such uncertainties.
the new critical movement's focus on literary texts can simultaneously disconnect from the real world while attempting to analyze and deconstruct its meaning.
while past literary theories struggled with the complexities of experience, contemporary challenges revolve around the fluidity and complexity of language.
ultimately, despite the evolving terminology, the underlying perspectives on the world have remained largely consistent.
these texts are intentionally obscure as they lack substance, offering little opportunity for further analysis beyond appreciating the thoroughness with which any trace of textual significance has been erased.
this eradication of meaning is a fundamental aspect of deconstruction in academic circles.
if your critique of another critic's interpretation of a text retains even the slightest remnants of 'positive' meaning, then someone else will inevitably deconstruct your work as well.
this process of deconstruction is a strategic maneuver, akin to traditional academic rivalry but with a spiritual overtone where triumph lies in self-emptying.
the victor is the one who successfully discards all preconceived notions and judgements, standing metaphorically empty-handed.
however, like any narrative, the post-structuralist story has a contrasting viewpoint.
despite the american deconstructionists believing their textual pursuits aligned with jacques derrida's ethos, jacques derrida himself disagreed.
he observed that certain american applications of deconstruction contribute to reinforcing 'an institutional closure', favoring the dominant political and economic interests of american society.
derrida's intentions extended beyond creating new reading methods; for him, deconstruction is fundamentally a political endeavor, aiming to deconstruct the rationale that upholds a specific system of thought, and consequently, an entire framework of political and social institutions.
his goal is not to deny the existence of ascertainable truths, meanings, identities, intentions, or historical continuities; instead, he aims to view these concepts as byproducts of a broader and more profound history involving the unconscious, social institutions, and practices.
it cannot be denied that his own work has often been criticized for being historically inaccurate, politically avoidant, and showing a lack of consideration for language as 'discourse'.
it is important to note that there is no simple dichotomy between an 'authentic' derrida and the distorted interpretations of his followers.
while deconstruction is often perceived as rejecting the existence of anything beyond discourse or promoting a realm of absolute difference where meaning and identity disappear, this view misrepresents derrida's intentions and the valuable contributions inspired by his ideas.
even though the oppression of women involves concrete aspects like motherhood, household chores, workplace bias, and unequal pay, it transcends these elements.
it also delves into sexual ideologies, how men and women perceive themselves and each other in male-dominated societies, and a spectrum of behaviors ranging from explicit to subconscious.
any political ideology that disregarded these issues was bound to become obsolete.
sexism and gender norms impact the fundamental personal aspects of human life, so a politics that ignored human experiences was inherently flawed.
the transition from structuralism to post-structuralism partly emerged as a reaction to these political necessities.
it is untrue that the women's movement solely possesses a monopoly on 'experience,' as is occasionally suggested.
socialism too has been shaped by the aspirations and struggles of countless individuals across generations, who have devoted their lives, and sometimes even given their lives, in pursuit of ideals beyond mere economic or doctrinal considerations.
it is oversimplified to conflate the personal with the political: while it holds true that the personal is indeed political, it is equally important to recognize that there are distinct aspects to both realms.
political battles cannot be completely equated with personal experiences, and vice versa.
the women's movement correctly dismissed rigid organizational structures and overly comprehensive political theories.
however, in doing so, it frequently emphasized the personal, spontaneous, and experiential aspects as if they were sufficient for a political strategy, disregarded theoretical frameworks in a manner resembling common anti-intellectualism, and showed indifference to the sufferings of anyone other than women and their political solutions in certain sectors, much like certain marxists had appeared indifferent to the oppression of individuals beyond the working class.
the perpetuation of patriarchal structures was not solely due to the benefits men gained from it, but also stemmed from a complex interplay of fear, desire, aggression, masochism, and anxiety that demanded closer scrutiny.
feminism was not just a standalone issue or campaign but a fundamental aspect that critiqued all aspects of personal, social, and political existence.
the essence of the women's movement, as perceived by those not directly involved, extends beyond advocating for gender equality, to question the very nature of power dynamics and societal hierarchies.
it emphasizes not only the importance of gender inclusivity but also presents a philosophical viewpoint suggesting that without incorporating feminine perspectives into history, the world's survival may be at stake.
in the preceding chapters, i have indicated a correlation between advancements in modern literary theory and the tumultuous political and ideological landscape of the twentieth century.
however, such upheaval encompasses more than just wars, economic downturns, and revolutions; it deeply affects individuals on a personal level.
it signifies a crisis in interpersonal relationships and individual identities, in addition to being a societal upheaval.
it is not to suggest that feelings of anxiety, persecution, and inner turmoil are exclusive to the period spanning from matthew arnold to paul de man; these emotions have been present throughout history.
what distinguishes this era is the manner in which these experiences are formalized into a structured body of knowledge.
this body of knowledge is known as psychoanalysis, pioneered by sigmund freud in late nineteenth century vienna.
i will now briefly outline freud's doctrines.
humans are willing to tolerate repression as long as they perceive some benefit from it; however, excessive demands may lead to illness.
this illness, termed neurosis, occurs when individuals are subjected to too much repression.
since every individual experiences some level of repression, it is suggested that the human race can be considered a 'neurotic animal'.
it is crucial to recognize that neurosis is intertwined with both our creativity and the roots of our discontent.
one way we manage unfulfilled desires is by 'sublimating' them, a concept introduced by freud which involves channeling these desires towards socially acceptable pursuits.
for instance, unaddressed sexual frustrations may unconsciously manifest in endeavors such as bridge or cathedral construction.
marx analyzed the social implications, classes, and political structures resulting from the necessity of labor, while freud studied its effects on our psychological well-being.
the core contradiction in freud's work lies in the idea that our true selves are shaped through repressing elements of our past.
just like how individuals are often unaware of the societal forces influencing their lives according to marx, we are also oblivious to the desires we suppress into the unconscious, as per freud's theory.
a curious point to ponder is why humans, rather than creatures like snails or tortoises, are prone to neurosis.
the infant will nurse at its mother's breast out of biological necessity, but during this process, it also experiences pleasure.
according to freud, this pleasurable sensation marks the initial emergence of sexuality.
the baby's oral stimulation transforms its mouth into an 'erotogenic zone,' a concept later manifested in behaviors like thumb-sucking and kissing.
this intimate bond with the mother evolves into a new libidinal dimension, signifying the birth of sexuality.
initially intertwined with biological instincts, sexuality gradually evolves into an autonomous force, distinct from basic survival urges.
freud views sexuality as a deviation, moving away from inherent self-preservation instincts towards alternative objectives.
throughout infancy, various erotogenic zones are activated, with the oral phase, the first stage of sexual development, centered on the urge to assimilate external objects.
it is evident that in this state, the child cannot be seen as a potential productive citizen.
it exhibits traits such as anarchy, sadism, aggression, self-centeredness, and an unrelenting pursuit of pleasure, driven by freud's pleasure principle.
furthermore, it displays a lack of regard for gender distinctions, not yet embodying what can be described as a 'gendered subject,' as its libido is not differentiated between masculine and feminine.
to thrive, the child must be guided, a process famously described by freud as the oedipus complex.
the child transitioning from the pre-oedipal phases mentioned exhibits not only anarchic and sadistic behaviors but also displays incestuous tendencies.
the boy's intimate connection with his mother's body fosters an unconscious yearning for a sexual union with her, whereas the girl, who has also been closely linked with her mother and initially expresses homosexual desires, subsequently redirects her desires towards her father.
the initial bond, or 'dyadic' relationship, between the infant and mother has evolved into a triangular dynamic involving the child and both parents.
consequently, the parent of the same gender will be perceived as a rival by the child in terms of affection towards the parent of the opposite gender.
the reason the boy-child chooses to give up his forbidden desire for his mother is due to the father's threat of castration.
this threat may not always be explicitly stated, but the boy comprehends that the girl is figuratively 'castrated', leading him to fear a similar fate for himself.
consequently, he suppresses his incestuous feelings, aligns with the 'reality principle', acknowledges the father's authority, distances himself from the mother, and consoles himself with the subconscious idea that even though he cannot presently replace his father and have his mother, the father represents an achievable position he can take on in the future.
while not a patriarch now, he aspires to become one.
by reconciling with his father, identifying with him, the boy transitions into the symbolic role of manhood.
in the future, he will eventually step into the role of a father, contributing to society through the process of sexual reproduction.
his previous scattered sexual energy has now been channeled and organized through the oedipus complex, focusing primarily on genital sexuality.
failure to resolve the oedipus complex successfully may result in sexual difficulties.
he might prioritize his mother's image over other women, possibly leading to homosexuality, or he may struggle to form fulfilling sexual relationships with women due to deeply ingrained issues related to the perception of women as 'castrated'.
the depiction of the young girl's journey through the oedipus complex is far from simple.
it is important to acknowledge that freud, influenced by the male-centric norms of his time, struggled to understand female sexuality, which he referred to as the 'dark continent'.
his work reveals biased and demeaning views towards women, which taint his analysis of the girl's progression through the oedipal phase.
the girl, realizing her perceived inferiority due to being 'castrated', shifts from her mother to her father in a bid to fulfill her desires.
however, as this endeavor is futile, she reluctantly reverts to her mother, identifies with her, embraces her feminine role, and unknowingly replaces the coveted penis with a symbolic desire for a child from her father.
there is no clear reason for the girl to relinquish this desire, as she is already "castrated" and not susceptible to castration threats.
this raises questions on how her oedipus complex unravels since "castration," instead of deterring her incestuous longing like in boys, actually enables it to flourish initially.
additionally, for the girl to navigate the oedipus complex, she must shift her affection from the mother to the father.
this transition of love objects is a more intricate process compared to the boy who can continue loving the mother, presenting further complexities in female oedipal development.
everything seems to be in order to reinforce traditional gender roles, delay personal gratifications, conform to authority, and perpetuate family and societal norms.
however, amidst all this, the rebellious and disobedient unconscious mind has been overlooked.
as the child evolves, it forms an ego and establishes its individual identity within various relational and societal structures.
this process necessitates the suppression of shameful desires into the unconscious mind.
the individual resulting from the oedipal complex becomes divided between the conscious and unconscious realms, susceptible to the haunting return of repressed thoughts.
while colloquially 'subconscious' is often used instead of 'unconscious,' it undermines the profound distinctiveness of the unconscious by simplifying it as a readily accessible entity just beneath the surface.
in any case, dreams serve as a compelling illustration of how the unconscious mind exhibits remarkable creativity, likened to a laid-back and under-equipped chef who creatively combines a variety of ingredients to form a makeshift dish.
just like this chef improvises by replacing missing spices or using the available ingredients of the day, dreams opportunistically incorporate remnants of the day, blending daily occurrences or nighttime sensations with long-buried childhood memories.
dreams are a key gateway to the unconscious, yet not the sole one.
according to freud, "parapraxes," such as slips of the tongue, memory lapses, and misinterpretations, can also reveal unconscious wishes and intentions.
additionally, the unconscious can surface through jokes, reflecting libidinal, anxious, or aggressive tendencies.
the most detrimental impact of the unconscious is seen in psychological disturbances, where repressed desires attempt to manifest but are blocked by the ego defensively, resulting in neurosis.
patients may exhibit symptoms that reflect and conceal these unconscious desires, leading to a complex internal conflict.
a more challenging condition to manage is psychosis, where the ego becomes overwhelmed by unconscious desires, unlike in neurosis where such desires are partially suppressed.
in psychosis, the ego loses control to the unconscious mind, causing a rupture in the connection between the ego and the external world.
consequently, the unconscious constructs an alternate, delusional reality.
those experiencing psychosis, such as individuals with paranoia and schizophrenia, lose touch with reality in significant ways.
while a neurotic person may develop a paralyzed limb, someone in a psychotic state might believe their arm has transformed into an elephant's trunk.
paranoia involves a structured form of delusion encompassing persecutory, jealous, and grandiose delusions, according to freud.
he attributes the root cause of paranoia to an unconscious defense against homosexuality, where the mind transforms the object of affection into a rival or persecutor.
this systematic reinterpretation of reality confirms suspicions by altering perceptions and beliefs.
the patient may resist the analyst's attempts to access her unconscious through various familiar techniques.
however, if the transferential process proceeds successfully, it can lead to the resolution of her issues by bringing them into her consciousness.
by appropriately terminating the transference dynamic at the right moment, the analyst aims to alleviate the patient of her problems.
an alternative description of this process is that the patient can retrieve and acknowledge repressed memories from her past, enabling her to construct a new, more comprehensive narrative about herself that provides insight and understanding of her struggles.
referred to as the 'talking cure', this therapeutic method is expected to yield positive results.
freud's work in psychoanalysis can be succinctly captured by his own phrase: "where id was, there shall ego be." the idea is to replace the overwhelming influence of unconscious impulses with reason and self-control.
despite freud's belief in the supremacy of reason and experience, he did not underestimate the complexities of the human mind.
he recognized our inherent predisposition for pleasure seeking and avoidance of frustration.
in his later studies, he introduced the concept of a destructive death instinct that drives humanity towards self-destructive behaviors.
the ultimate aim, according to freud, is a return to a state of non-existence to evade harm to the ego.
freud's empathy towards the ego reflects his empathy towards humanity, struggling under the overwhelming expectations imposed by a civilization founded on desire suppression and delayed gratification.
while he dismissed utopian ideas to alter this situation and held conventional and authoritarian social beliefs, he still viewed positively efforts to dismantle or improve private property and national institutions.
this was rooted in his profound belief that contemporary society had grown oppressive due to its repressive nature.
freud's intricate and innovative theory naturally sparks intense debates and criticisms.
freudianism has faced numerous challenges and should not be viewed without scrutiny.
one major concern lies in how it validates its principles and supports its arguments; an example is when an american behaviorist psychologist commented that "freud's work lacks testability." the applicability of freud's concepts to contemporary scientific standards is questionable due to his reliance on outdated scientific views prevalent in the 19th century.
despite striving for impartiality and objectivity, freud's work is inevitably influenced by "counter-transference," colored by his unconscious desires and at times distorted by his conscious ideological convictions, as evidenced by the presence of sexist values within his theories.
equally significant is the criticism that psychoanalysis, when practiced as a medical treatment, can be perceived as a method of controlling society oppressively by assigning labels to individuals and pressuring them to conform to arbitrary standards of 'normalcy'.
this complaint is often directed not just at freudian psychoanalysis but at the field of psychiatric medicine in general.
however, when considering freud's own perspectives on what is considered 'normal', this criticism may not be entirely accurate.
contrary to common belief, freud's research shed light on how flexible and diverse human libido can be, challenging conventional notions of normal sexual behavior and highlighting that what is labeled as a sexual deviation could actually be part of a standard spectrum of human sexuality.
while it is true that freudian psychoanalysis often involves some concept of a sexual standard, it is crucial to recognize that such norms are not inherently determined by natural factors.
freud has faced familiar criticisms that are difficult to confirm.
one common critique questions the plausibility of a young girl desiring to have a baby with her father.
whether this assertion holds true is not determined by mere 'common sense.' it is vital to acknowledge the enigmatic nature of the unconscious as depicted in dreams, which differs significantly from the rationality of the conscious ego, before hastily discrediting freud based on intuition alone.
another prevalent objection is the notion that freud oversimplifies by attributing everything to sexuality, being labeled a 'pan-sexualist.' however, this view is overly simplistic as freud's thinking was fundamentally dualistic and not solely fixated on sexual aspects.
while freud did view sexuality as essential to human behavior, he balanced this perspective by acknowledging non-sexual drives such as self-preservation instincts.
therefore, while sexuality held a crucial place in freud's theories, it did not entail reducing all human activities to sexual motivations.
parental roles, child care practices, and the associated images and beliefs are all culturally influenced aspects that can significantly differ across societies and historical eras.
the concept of 'childhood' is a relatively recent construct, and the diverse historical family structures encompassed by the term 'family' render its utility limited.
despite variations, a common belief that appears pervasive in these institutions is the perceived inferiority of girls and women compared to boys and men, uniting societies worldwide.
this deep-seated prejudice, rooted in early familial and sexual development, has led to the recognition of the significance of psychoanalysis by some feminists.
feminists have turned to the french psychoanalyst jacques lacan, a freudian theorist, for insights, despite his unsupportive views towards the women's movement.
lacan's approach represents a distinctive effort to reframe freudian concepts in a manner relevant to those studying the human subject, its societal role, and particularly its relationship with language.
this focus on language also captivates literary theorists.
in his ecrits, lacan endeavors to reevaluate freud's principles through the lens of structuralist and post-structuralist discourses.
although this approach results in a complex and at times perplexing body of work, it is crucial to explore to comprehend the interconnectedness of post-structuralism and psychoanalysis.
i have discussed freud's perspective on the early stages of infant development where a clear distinction between subject and object, self and external world, is not yet present.
lacan refers to this stage as 'imaginary', describing it as a state where there is no distinct center of self, leading the self to blend with objects and vice versa in a constant interchange.
during the pre-oedipal phase, the child shares a 'symbiotic' connection with the mother's body, blurring the boundaries between them.
the child relies on the mother for survival, but one can also envision the child perceiving the external world as reliant on itself.
the young child, still grappling with physical coordination, encounters a unified reflection in the mirror that is both satisfying and slightly illusory.
the relationship with this mirrored image is at an early stage and falls into the realm of the 'imaginary'.
it represents a merging of self and reflection where the boundaries between subject and object are blurred.
this marks the initial steps towards developing a sense of self-awareness.
the self, portrayed through the mirror, has a predominantly narcissistic quality: it emerges through recognizing a reflection of oneself mirrored by an external entity.
this external entity is both a part of the self that the child identifies with and yet also distinct, almost foreign.
the mirror image perceived by the young child can be seen as 'alienated' in nature as the child gazes upon it with a sense of familiarity and yet a slight disconnect, finding a pleasing coherence that is not entirely mirrored in their own physical form.
lacan's concept of the imaginary pertains to the realm of images where identifications are formed, yet in this process, individuals often misperceive and misrecognize themselves.
during childhood and beyond, one continues to engage in such imaginary identifications with external objects, forming the basis of the ego.
lacan views the ego as a narcissistic mechanism through which a fabricated sense of unity is reinforced by seeking identification with external entities in the world.
in exploring the pre-oedipal or imaginary phase, we delve into a state where the essence is simplified into two entities: the child itself and the predominant other, often the mother, symbolizing the external world for the child.
however, as highlighted in our examination of the oedipus complex, this initial 'dyadic' structure undergoes a transition towards a 'triadic' one, as the father intercedes and disrupts this equilibrium.
the father embodies what lacan defines as the law, primarily manifested as the societal prohibition on incest.
this intrusion unsettles the child's intimate bond with the mother, prompting the child to acknowledge the father as a representation of a broader familial and societal framework in which it is a mere component.
not only does the child inhabit a role within this network, but this role is predetermined by the societal norms within which it is raised.
upon the father's arrival, the child becomes enveloped in post-structuralist unease.
now, it must comprehend saussure's argument that identities are formed through the distinction that one term or subject defines itself solely by excluding another.
notably, the child's initial encounter with sexual distinction coincides with its early exploration of language.
the infant's cry functions more as a signal than a true sign, conveying its needs such as hunger or discomfort.
as the young child begins delving into language, it subconsciously grasps that a sign holds significance by differing from other signs and recognizes that a sign implies the absence of the object it represents.
language serves as a substitute for objects: all language can be seen as inherently 'metaphorical', stepping in for a direct, non-verbal possession of the object in question.
the subject's identity is formed by its relationships of both difference and similarity with other subjects in its vicinity, a concept it begins to grasp.
this realization leads the child from the realm of imagination to what lacan identifies as the 'symbolic order': an established framework of societal and sexual roles and connections inherent in family and society.
in freudian theory, this marks the child's completion of the challenging journey through the oedipus complex.
nevertheless, not everything is in perfect harmony.
as illustrated in freud's work, the individual resulting from this development is essentially fragmented, with a sharp division between the conscious functioning of the ego and the buried desires of the unconscious mind.
the foundation of our being stems from this initial repression of desires.
a child must come to terms with the realization that direct connection with reality, particularly with the forbidden physical form of the mother, is unattainable.
it is ousted from the realm of complete, imaginative possession to the realm of abstract language.
language is considered 'empty' because it revolves around an ongoing cycle of distinctions and voids: rather than possessing things entirely, the child is compelled to navigate through a never-ending chain of linguistic symbols.
one symbol leads to another, and so forth infinitely, transitioning from the 'metaphorical' realm of reflection to the 'metonymic' realm of language.
lacan explains that desire is the perpetual shift from one symbol to another without definitive resolution.
desire originates from a sense of incompleteness, driving individuals to seek fulfillment.
human communication operates on this premise of absence; words derive significance from what they represent and what they exclude.
engaging with language exposes one to desire, as revealed by lacan's observation that language shapes yearnings.
language fragments and organizes the richness of the imagination, ensuring that there is no ultimate object or meaning to bring coherence to all aspects.
in embracing language, individuals are separated from what lacan terms the 'real,' a transcendent domain perpetually eluding definition and lying beyond established systems of representation.
notably, this separation extends to the maternal body: post-oedipus complex, the pursuit of this cherished entity continues incessantly despite its unattainability.
expressing the truth in a purely unfiltered manner is an unattainable feat.
lacan's perplexing literary style, reflective of the language of the unconscious, hints at the impossibility of conveying an untarnished meaning through speech or writing, debunking the pre-freudian notion.
while we may perceive ourselves as harmonious entities in our waking life, enabling our actions, this unity exists only on the surface level of the ego, just a fraction of our subconscious explored in psychoanalysis.
the ego serves as a facade for a subject that is in a perpetual state of dispersion, devoid of self-identity, interlaced within the discourses that shape it.
the profound disparity between these two layers of existence is strikingly brought to light when one refers to oneself in a sentence.
when i express the intention, "tomorrow i will mow the lawn," the exclamation mark i vocalize signifies a distinct and recognizable point of reference, contrasting with the complex inner workings of my self that is doing the speaking.
linguistic theory categorizes the former as the 'subject of the enunciation', which is the theme conveyed in my statement, and the latter as the 'subject of the enunciating', representing the individual who articulates the words.
while in speech and writing, these two identities may merge to a certain extent, this amalgam is essentially illusory.
the 'subject of the enunciating', the actual person speaking or writing, cannot wholly encapsulate themselves in their words; there is no single symbol that can encapsulate the entirety of one's identity.
thus, i can only allude to myself in language through the practical use of a pronoun, such as 'i'.
the strength of these texts resides in their concealment of their origins, or what can be referred to as their production methods.
this quality bears a striking similarity to the human ego's tendency to flourish by burying the acknowledgment of how it came into existence.
in contrast, numerous modernist literary pieces integrate the act of creation itself as a fundamental element of their content, exposing the process of their formation.
they do not function as barthes's "natural" signs but rather, following the formalists' ideology, they transparently reveal the mechanisms involved in their composition.
this approach is used to prevent being perceived as absolute truth, prompting readers to critically evaluate the limited and subjective ways reality is portrayed, and to acknowledge that events could have unfolded differently.
one prominent example of this type of literature is bertolt brecht's drama, although numerous other instances can be found in contemporary arts, notably in cinema.
for instance, contrast a typical hollywood film, where the camera merely acts as a passive observer, offering viewers a direct view of reality.
while immersed in such a film, it's easy to overlook that this depiction is not a straightforward representation of events but a carefully orchestrated creation involving numerous individuals' actions and interpretations.
consider envisioning a cinematic scene where the camera moves energetically and restlessly, shifting its focus rapidly from one object to another.
it meticulously explores each object from various angles before abruptly moving on to something else.
this approach, though not considered avant-garde, emphasizes how the camera's activity is highlighted compared to traditional filmmaking.
rather than passively observing the scene's unfolding, viewers are compelled to engage with the deliberate camerawork.
the essence of the sequence lies in its technical execution, not in a preexisting reality for the camera to capture.
the significance and meaning of the scene are derived from the cinematic techniques employed, establishing a unique relationship between what is shown and how it is presented.
the essay queries how individuals frequently conform to the prevailing ideologies in their societies, ideologies althusser deems crucial for upholding the ruling class's power.
it reflects on the mechanisms through which this compliance occurs.
althusser, often viewed as a 'structuralist' marxist, suggests that individuals are shaped by diverse societal factors, lacking inherent unity.
in analyzing human societies scientifically, individuals are considered merely as functions or outcomes of various social structures, positioned within a mode of production or a particular social class.
however, this analytical approach diverges from our subjective experiences of self.
in other words, althusser reconsiders the concept of ideology through the lens of lacan's 'imaginary'.
according to althusser's theory, the relationship between an individual and society resembles the connection between a young child and their mirror image in lacan's theory.
in both scenarios, individuals create a cohesive self-image by identifying with an object that reflects this image in a closed, self-absorbed loop.
however, this self-image involves a misperception as it idealizes the individual's actual circumstances.
the child is not as unified as its reflection may imply, similarly, in the ideological realm, the individual is not the independent, self-sufficient subject they perceive themselves to be, but rather a composite of various social influencers.
enamored by the idealized self-image they perceive, individuals willingly subject themselves to it, ultimately becoming a subject through this process of 'subjection.' many experts now find significant flaws in althusser's insightful essay.
it suggests that ideology primarily acts as an oppressive force that dominates individuals, overlooking the complexities of ideological struggle and containing misinterpretations of lacan.
however, the essay is an effort to demonstrate how lacanian theory extends beyond the confines of traditional psychoanalysis, highlighting its implications in various fields.
by reframing freudian ideas through the lens of language, which is fundamentally a social construct, lacan enables us to explore the intricate connections between the unconscious mind and human society.
his work emphasizes that the unconscious is not solely an internal, turbulent realm within individuals but a product of our interactions with others.
it can be viewed as existing outside or between individuals, akin to our interpersonal relationships.
just like our parents, the world is ready and waiting for us, and we can never fully control or manipulate it to serve our purposes, much like we can never completely break free from the influential role our parents have in shaping us.
in lacanian terms, language, the unconscious, parents, and the symbolic order are interconnected concepts.
while not interchangeable, lacan views them as closely related.
he refers to them as the 'other,' which, similar to language, predates us and remains beyond our full comprehension.
this 'other' is responsible for our formation as individuals but continues to elude our complete understanding.
according to lacan, our unconscious desires are directed towards this 'other,' seeking a fulfillment that remains unattainable.
furthermore, lacan notes that our desires are also influenced by this 'other' in some capacity.
in cases where the father, like walter morel, is burdened with particularly taxing and oppressive work, his role within the family tends to suffer.
morel's interactions with his children mainly revolve around practical household tasks due to his exhausting work schedule.
additionally, his limited education hinders his ability to effectively communicate his emotions, widening the gap between him and his family.
the demanding and regimented nature of his work leads to domestic tension and aggression, pushing his children closer to their mother while fueling her possessiveness.
to compensate for his lack of esteem at work, the father attempts to assert traditional male dominance at home, further alienating his children.
we can extend these considerations to the very structure of the novel, including how it presents and organizes its narrative, character development, and choice of narrative perspective.
the text predominantly aligns with and supports paul's perspective, as the story unfolds mainly through his viewpoint, limiting alternative sources of information.
as paul takes center stage, his father fades into the background.
the novel delves more deeply into mrs.
morel's inner world than into her husband's, emphasizing her character while downplaying his, a technique that strengthens the protagonist's viewpoints and emotions.
however, some elements of the novel appear to contradict this 'angled' portrayal.
daleski, lawrence criticizes morel heavily while also subtly expressing sympathy for him, and although mrs.
morel is initially celebrated, her harsh actions challenge this perception.
in line with lacanian theory, the novel conveys implicit meanings that differ from its explicit statements.
this ambiguity can be partly explained through psychoanalytical analysis, particularly in the complex oedipal relationship between the boy and his father.
the boy, torn between love and unconscious rivalry towards his father, instinctively shields him from his own inner aggression.
another reason for this ambiguity is that the novel acknowledges that while paul needs to distance himself from the narrow, aggressive world of the miners to embrace middle-class values, it also recognizes that this new consciousness is not without its flaws.
morel exemplifies both the controlling and life-suffocating aspects, along with the valuable ones.
the text suggests that walter morel has suppressed his true self, a point that is emphasized heavily by the author, yet it is arguable whether this overt narrative intervention truly adds significant value.
paradoxically, the novel simultaneously portrays elements contradicting this claim.
the passage illustrates how morel's presence continues to influence the narrative despite his physical absence.
the narrative gradually shifts focus from morel to his son, indicating how the story's structure plays a significant role in diminishing morel's character.
furthermore, the text suggests that morel's shortcomings are not solely his own fault but are primarily a result of being exploited by ruthless capitalism that values him only as a means of production.
although paul strives to distance himself from his father's influence, he, too, avoids acknowledging these harsh realities.
ultimately, the novel "sons and lovers" not only explores the working-class experience but also serves as lawrence's personal journey to break free from it.
when analyzing "sons and lovers" through these specific viewpoints, we are essentially crafting a 'sub-text' for the novel - an underlying narrative that exists within it, discernible at certain points of uncertainty, avoidance, or exaggeration.
as readers, we have the ability to elucidate this sub-text even if the novel itself does not explicitly do so.
every literary work harbors one or more such sub-texts, which could be regarded as the 'unconscious' element of the work.
the revelations of a work, like any form of writing, are intricately tied to its omissions: what remains unsaid, and the manner in which it remains so, can be just as significant as what is expressly stated; the seemingly lacking, peripheral, or ambiguous aspects can unlock crucial insights into its interpretations.
this does not imply a complete dismissal or reversal of 'what the novel conveys,' arguing, for instance, that morel is the true hero and his wife the antagonist.
paul's perspective is not inherently flawed: his mother does indeed evoke a far greater sense of empathy than his father.
there are generally four categories of psychoanalytical literary criticism, each focusing on different aspects.
these include analyzing the author, exploring the contents of the work, examining its formal structure, or studying the reader's perspective.
the majority of psychoanalytical criticism tends to concentrate on the first two aspects, which are considered to be somewhat restrictive and problematic.
interpreting the author's psyche is often seen as speculative and raises similar issues as debating the significance of an author's intentions.
meanwhile, examining the unconscious motivations of characters or the psychoanalytical importance of objects or events within the text, known as analyzing the 'content,' though somewhat valuable, can also be oversimplified, reminiscent of the search for symbolic meanings like the phallic symbol.
it is noted that freud's explorations into art and literature predominantly focused on these first two modes of analysis.
freud refers to the dream that arises from this labor as the 'manifest content', the dream we recall.
the dream is more than a mere reflection or replication of the unconscious; a process of 'production' or alteration occurs between the unconscious and the dream we experience.
for freud, the core of the dream lies not in its basic elements or 'latent content', but in the dream-work itself.
it is this 'process' that freud scrutinizes in his analysis.
the literary theories discussed in this book can be viewed as a type of 'secondary revision' of the literary text.
these theories aim to create 'harmony', 'coherence', 'deep structure', or 'essential meaning', by filling gaps, resolving contradictions, and smoothing over conflicts within the text.
the purpose is to make the text more accessible for readers, ensuring a seamless consumption experience without any unsettling irregularities.
many scholars strive to achieve this by neatly resolving ambiguities and presenting the text in a straightforward manner for readers to explore.
one common approach to this secondary revision is evident in the analysis of t.
many of the literary theories we have examined tend to perceive literary works as expressions or reflections of reality, portraying human experiences, conveying an author's intentions, or mirroring the structures of the human mind.
in contrast, freud's analysis of dreams allows us to consider literature not as a mere reflection but as a creative act.
similar to dreaming, language and other literary texts take perceptions of the world and transform them through specific techniques into a product.
these techniques, referred to as "literary form," are the tools used to shape this production.
as a literary text processes its raw materials, it typically refines them through a secondary revision process, striving to organize them into a coherent and engaging narrative, though success may vary as seen with works like sons and lovers.
in order to achieve this, the analysis focuses on particular elements within the dream-text, such as distortions, ambiguities, absences, and omissions, which are referred to as 'symptomatic' places.
these elements can offer valuable insights into the 'latent content' of the text, revealing the unconscious impulses that have influenced its creation.
similar to this approach, literary criticism, as demonstrated in lawrence's novel, can uncover hidden meanings by examining evasions, ambivalences, and moments of intense expression in the narrative.
by exploring unspoken words, repetitions, and shifts in language usage, critics can penetrate beyond the surface of the text and uncover its 'sub-text', which the work both hides and reveals.
in essence, literary analysis can focus not only on what the text communicates explicitly, but also on how it functions.
there are two distinctive american critics who draw inspiration from freud's theories.
kenneth burke creatively combines elements of freud, marx, and linguistics to develop his unique perspective, viewing literary work as a symbolic form of action.
on the other hand, harold bloom utilizes freud's concepts to introduce an innovative literary theory, fundamentally reinterpreting literary history through the lens of the oedipus complex.
in bloom's interpretation, poets are akin to sons feeling burdened by the influence of a 'strong' predecessor, echoing the oppression sons feel from their fathers.
each poem, according to bloom, serves as an endeavor to break free from this 'anxiety of influence' by reshaping prior works in a deliberate manner.
the poet, engaged in an intense oedipal rivalry with the dominant 'precursor', strives to neutralize its influence by immersing himself in it, creating a narrative that revises, displaces, and reinterprets the precursor poem.
consequently, all poems can be interpreted as reinterpretations of existing works, often perceived as 'misreadings' or 'misprisions', as efforts to resist their overpowering impact and make room for the poet's own distinct creative expression.
each poet finds themselves positioned as 'belated', a figure at the end of a literary lineage; the adept poet confronts this belatedness with bravery, working to subvert the authority of the precursor.
essentially, every poem becomes an act of subversion, deploying various techniques that function both as rhetorical devices and psychological defense mechanisms, in order to dismantle and surpass the original poem.
thus, the essence of a poem lies within another poem.
a form of humanism presented here challenges the 'serene linguistic nihilism' prevalent in american deconstruction, moving beyond the constant deconstruction of specific meanings towards a perspective of poetry as an expression of human will and affirmation.
the intense and confrontational nature observed in much of bloom's work, characterized by the intricate use of arcane terminology, reflects the effort and urgency of this endeavor.
bloom's critique vividly highlights the predicament faced by modern liberal or romantic humanists - the impossibility of returning to a tranquil, optimistic human belief post-marx, freud, and post-structuralism, while also acknowledging that any humanism influenced by such rigorous theories, as in bloom's case, is inevitably tainted by them.
bloom's dramatic portrayals of poetic figures still exude the grandeur of a time before freud, yet they have shed their innocence, becoming more about internal conflicts and emotional complexities such as guilt, envy, anxiety, and aggression.
any humanistic literary theory that disregarded such realities could not be genuinely considered 'modern'; however, a theory that acknowledges them is likely to become sober and cynical, leading to a relentless determination to affirm itself.
bloom navigates through american deconstruction enough to return to a heroic human perspective but does so through a nietzschean invocation of the 'will to power' and 'will to persuasion' of individual imagination, which may be perceived as arbitrary and symbolic.
within this male-dominated realm of fathers and sons, the focus intensifies on power, conflict, and strength of will, with criticism being viewed by bloom as a poetic form akin to poems serving as inherent literary critiques.
ultimately, the success of a critical interpretation, for bloom, depends less on its accuracy and more on the rhetorical potency of the critic.
experiencing this loss can be both distressing and invigorating: desire often thrives on what remains slightly out of reach, providing a key source of satisfaction in storytelling.
without the hope of eventual possession, the intensity of our longing could turn unbearable, giving way to dissatisfaction.
it is crucial for us to believe that the desired object will ultimately be restored to us; whether it is tom jones returning to paradise hall or hercule poirot solving the mystery.
this assurance allows us to find satisfaction as our anticipation is relieved, and the twists and turns in the narrative serve to heighten our enjoyment by keeping us engaged until the resolution.
our ability to endure the object's absence is supported by the underlying certainty that it will be reunited with us eventually.
ultimately, meaning is derived from the connection between loss and recovery.
certainly, the reverse holds true as well.
once integrated into the symbolic order, we are unable to perceive or own any object without subconsciously considering its potential absence, acknowledging that its existence is somewhat arbitrary and temporary.
if the mother departs, it is seen as a temporary measure leading up to her eventual return.
however, even upon her reunion with us, we cannot dismiss the notion that she could vanish at any moment, possibly never to return.
traditional realist narratives tend to soothe our fears of absence by emphasizing presence, acting as a 'conservative' force.
in contrast, many modernist works by authors like brecht and beckett prompt us to contemplate that what we observe may have unfolded differently or not at all.
in the realm of imagination, death does not exist because the world's survival relies on my existence just as much as my existence relies on it.
it is only when we delve into the symbolic order that we are confronted with the reality of mortality, as the world does not actually hinge on us.
while we are immersed in an imaginary state of existence, we mistakenly perceive our identities as fixed and reality as unchangeable.
according to althusser, we are ensnared by ideology, accepting social norms as 'natural' without examining how they and our identities were constructed and could potentially be altered.
this rhythmic pattern can be interpreted as a type of language, even though it lacks meaning at present.
in order for recognisable language to emerge, this diverse flow needs to be segmented and structured into consistent terms.
by assimilating into the symbolic realm, this initial 'semiotic' process becomes repressed.
however, this repression is not absolute, as traces of the semiotic can still be observed as an impulsive force within language itself.
these traces manifest through tone, rhythm, the physical and tangible aspects of language, as well as through contradiction, lack of meaning, interruption, quietness, and void.
the semiotic represents the contrasting element of language that is deeply intertwined with it.
originating from the pre-oedipal stage, the semiotic is linked to the child's connection with the mother's physical form, while the symbolic, as previously discussed, relates to the paternal law.
therefore, the semiotic is closely associated with femininity, yet it is not a language exclusive to women, as it originates from a pre-oedipal phase that does not recognise gender distinctions.
james joyce represents kristeva's theories in a remarkable manner in the english language.
however, shades of these theories can also be found in the works of virginia woolf.
woolf's writing style, characterized by its fluidity, expansiveness, and sensuality, resists the traditional male-dominated metaphysical world epitomized by the philosopher mr.
ramsay in "to the lighthouse." ramsay's worldview operates on abstract truths, clear-cut distinctions, and fixed essences, reflecting a patriarchal society where the phallus symbolizes absolute and unchallenged truth.
our contemporary society, as described by post-structuralists, is 'phallocentric' and 'logocentric,' believing in immediate access to ultimate truth through language.
jacques derrida combines these notions, forming 'phallogocentric,' or 'cocksure,' implying an unwavering confidence in those in power.
woolf's 'semiotic' fiction can be interpreted as a critique of this unwarranted certainty that allows individuals with social and sexual dominance to maintain control.
in feminist literary theory, a debated question is whether there exists a distinct feminine mode of writing.
kristeva's concept of the 'semiotic' is not inherently feminine, as most of the writers she deems 'revolutionary' are male.
however, due to its close connection to the mother's body and the belief that women maintain a stronger bond to this body for psychoanalytic reasons, one might anticipate that such writing could be more prevalent among women.
some feminists have rejected this idea, concerned that it may perpetuate an essentialized and non-cultural notion of femininity.
they also suspect that it might resemble the sexist stereotype of women as merely chattering.
it's crucial to understand that kristeva's theory does not necessarily entail these beliefs.
the semiotic is not a replacement for the symbolic order or an alternative language to 'normal' discourse.
instead, it is a process within conventional sign-systems that challenges them.
the female identity is intricately woven within the societal norms, much like any other gender, and yet she is often positioned on the outskirts, deemed inferior to masculine authority.
women exist within the realm of male dominance, both as an admired figure within it, and as a marginalized outsider.
they can be perceived as a force that maintains order in a man's world or as a symbol of disruption and disorder.
this duality challenges the clear boundaries set by such a system.
despite being represented through the lens of a male-driven society, women contain elements that defy easy categorization, remaining elusive and resistant to complete representation within that framework.
according to this perspective, femininity, considered as a mode of existence and communication distinct from women, represents a societal force that challenges it.
this notion directly influences the political landscape, particularly through the feminist movement.
in connection with kristeva's concept of a semiotic force that disrupts established meanings and institutions, the logical political alignment would seem to lean towards some form of anarchism.
while a constant dismantling of fixed structures may not be a sufficient reaction in politics, similarly in theory, assuming that a literary work that destabilizes meaning is automatically 'revolutionary' is flawed.
a text can achieve this subversion in the service of right-wing irrationalism or without any clear purpose.
kristeva's argument can be criticized as overly formalistic and easily caricatured: can reading mallarme really bring about the downfall of the bourgeois state?
while she does not claim that it will happen, she overlooks the political essence of a text, the historical context in which it challenges established meanings, and how these aspects are interpreted and utilized.
simply deconstructing the unified self is not inherently revolutionary.
kristeva is accurate in recognizing that bourgeois individualism thrives on this concept, but her analysis tends to stop once the self is shattered and left contradictory.
in contrast, brecht believes that breaking down societal norms through art is integral to creating a new type of individual, one that embraces not just internal disarray but also social unity.
this new individual would seek not only the pleasures of language but also strive for social justice.
in conclusion, it is essential to highlight a significant and straightforward connection between psychoanalysis and literature.
freudian theory suggests that the underlying drive behind human behavior is the pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain, fundamentally rooted in hedonism.
this can be seen as a key link between the two fields.
a vast majority of individuals engage with poems, novels, and plays because they derive pleasure from them.
surprisingly, this seemingly obvious connection is often overlooked in academic settings such as universities.
despite the challenges posed by academic literature programs that sometimes dampen the enjoyment of literary works, those who manage to sustain their pleasure in reading after years of study are arguably either heroic or perhaps considered out of the norm.
in the earlier sections of this book, it was noted that the inherent pleasure derived from reading literature presented a significant challenge for the early advocates who sought to legitimize it as an academic discipline.
there was a need to imbue the subject with a certain level of gravitas to establish "english" as a respected counterpart to classics.
concurrently, in the realms of thrillers and historical fiction, readers continued to voraciously consume romantic novels, largely unaware of the academic world's concerns and anxieties.
the current situation is marked by an interesting observation that the term 'pleasure' is perceived with trivial implications, appearing less weighty compared to 'serious'.
describing a poem as extremely pleasurable can seem less valid critically than asserting it to be morally profound.
there is a notion that comedy is shallower than tragedy.
the contrast between the morally serious nature of cambridge scholars and the oxford scholars who appreciate george eliot for being 'amusing' leaves little room for a comprehensive theory of pleasure.
however, psychoanalysis, among other things, delves into this exact dilemma: its sophisticated arsenal of intellect aims to explore fundamental aspects such as what brings individuals satisfaction or despair and how they can alleviate unhappiness to achieve greater happiness.
if freudianism is viewed as a science focused on impartially analyzing psychological forces, it is a science dedicated to liberating individuals from obstacles hindering their fulfillment and well-being.
it is not implied that psychoanalysis is the sole solution for understanding issues related to literary significance and enjoyment.
our preferences toward language are shaped not only by the unconscious forces they trigger in us but also by our conscious beliefs and inclinations.
the interaction between these aspects is intricate and should be elucidated through a thorough analysis of a specific literary work.
the challenges associated with literary value and enjoyment appear to be located at the intersection of psychoanalysis, linguistics, and ideology, an area that is yet to be extensively explored.
we have some knowledge suggesting that it is indeed possible to articulate the reasons why individuals appreciate certain word arrangements to a greater extent than traditional literary criticism has acknowledged.
a deeper comprehension of the joys and sorrows that readers derive from literature could potentially shed light on more critical issues of happiness and unhappiness.
a significant aspect arising from freud's writings is a unique political-psychoanalytical approach that delves into the concept of happiness within entire societies, distinct from lacan's concerns.
this approach, epitomized by german psychoanalyst wilhelm reich and scholars like herbert marcuse from the frankfurt school, analyzes how societies grapple with the pursuit of instant gratification juxtaposed with deferred fulfillment.
the social, economic, and cultural realms are painted as "eroticized," inundated with enticing products and alluring visuals, while intimate relationships encounter turmoil and disorder.
literary theory is not just a subject of study by itself but rather a unique lens through which we can deepen our understanding of contemporary history.
it is not surprising that any theoretical framework exploring human meaning, values, language, emotions, and experiences necessarily involves addressing broader philosophical questions about individuals, societies, power dynamics, sexuality, historical interpretations, current realities, and future aspirations.
rather than lamenting or criticizing literary theory for delving into these inquiries, we should acknowledge that there is no such thing as a completely detached or pure literary theory unaffected by these considerations.
the concept of a pristine, untainted literary theory is a fallacy of academic discourse, as evidenced by some theories that strive to detach themselves from historical and political contexts but inadvertently reveal their ideological underpinnings.
however, biases are not always covert or unconscious.
in some cases, like matthew arnold's, they are overt, while in others, like t.
eliot's, they are covert but not unconscious.
the issue with literary theory is not just its political nature or its tendency to overlook it, but rather the specific politics it embodies.
in essence, the critique lies in how most of the literary theories discussed in this book have upheld rather than questioned the fundamental assumptions of the existing power structure, as evidenced by its current implications.
this is not to suggest that matthew arnold endorsed nuclear weapons or that there aren't literary theorists who would oppose a system where some profit from arms sales while others suffer poverty.
literature, according to popular belief, is deeply entwined with the real experiences of individuals: it is focused on the tangible rather than the theoretical, showcasing life in all its diverse richness, and shunning unproductive abstract analysis in favor of capturing the essence of existence.
ironically, the evolution of modern literary theory narrates a shift away from these realities towards a seemingly boundless array of alternatives: the poem itself, the ideal society, timeless truths, the human imagination, the workings of the mind, myth, language, and more.
this departure from concrete history can be partly attributed to a response against nineteenth-century historical criticism's overly scholarly and reductive approach; however, the radical nature of this shift remains quite noticeable.
the extremity of literary theory, its stubborn, unconventional, and endlessly imaginative refusal to acknowledge social and historical truths, stands out to anyone studying its texts, even though 'extremism' is a term typically associated with those who emphasize literature's impact on real life.
despite attempting to distance itself from modern ideologies, literary theory often unconsciously aligns with them, exposing its elitist, sexist, or individualistic tendencies through the seemingly 'aesthetic' or 'unpolitical' language used to discuss literary texts.
it operates on the assumption that the contemplative individual self, absorbed in reading and seeking connections with experience, truth, reality, history, or tradition, is at the core of the world.
while acknowledging the importance of interpersonal relationships and the complexities of human existence, literary theory frequently elevates individual consciousness within its narrow circle of interactions as the ultimate measure of significance.
as we stray from the profound introspection of personal life, epitomized by literature, existence can feel increasingly mundane, mechanized, and devoid of personal connection.
any attempt to define literary theory based on a distinct method is bound to falter.
literary theory aims to ponder the essence of literature and literary critique.
consider the myriad methods employed in literary criticism - from delving into a poet's childhood struggles to analyzing their unique syntax, to interpreting sounds evoked by specific words, exploring the experience of reading, contextualizing works within societal conflicts, or even gauging commercial success.
these methods vary significantly and share no fundamental similarities.
in essence, they align more with diverse academic fields like linguistics, history, and sociology than with each other.
therefore, from a methodological perspective, literary criticism emerges as a multidimensional field.
if literary theory is viewed as a form of metacriticism, a critical analysis of critique itself, then it naturally assumes the status of an expansive, multifaceted domain.
it may be seen as fortunate that this approach has yet to influence fields like medicine or aeronautical engineering.
however, one should not dismiss this method entirely as the inklings and hunches one possesses stem from deeply ingrained assumptions that can be just as persistent as those of a structuralist.
interestingly, this kind of 'intuitive' criticism relies on 'intelligent sensitivity' rather than a strict 'method', and it does not always identify ideological implications in literature.
despite this, there is no inherent reason why it could not.
certain traditional critics differentiate themselves by claiming to engage with literature directly, without subscribing to theories.
they maintain that no theoretical or ideological biases stand between them and the text: for instance, labeling george eliot's later works as exuding 'mature resignation' is not considered ideological, whereas suggesting they reflect avoidance and compromise is.
engaging in debates with critics who hold strong ideological beliefs can be challenging, as their conviction in the righteousness of their interpretations is profound.
they often believe their readings are completely unbiased.
leavis was deemed 'doctrinal' for critiquing milton, not c.
similarly, feminist critics are perceived to blur the lines between literature and politics by analyzing gender representations in fiction while traditional critics are viewed as politicizing by claiming clarissa in richardson's work is partly to blame for her own assault.
northrop frye and the new critics believed they had successfully combined these two approaches, yet the question remains: how many contemporary literature students engage with their work?
liberal humanism is now viewed as the feeble moral compass of middle-class society, characterized by its mild, delicate, and powerless nature, while structuralism has all but disappeared into the archive of literary history.
the ineffectiveness of liberal humanism highlights its conflicting relationship with modern capitalism.
while it is a part of the sanctioned ideology of society, the actual social structure of capitalism tends to undervalue its principles.
concern for individual uniqueness, enduring human truths, and rich human experiences is not a priority in entities like the foreign office or the boardrooms of corporations like standard oil.
the capitalist system often hypocritically appreciates the arts, mainly as a profitable investment rather than genuine admiration.
despite this, capitalist governments allocate funds to humanities departments in academia.
these departments, typically the first targeted for budget cuts during economic crises, receive this support not only out of hypocrisy or to mask philistine tendencies but possibly due to deeper motivations.
liberal humanism, while being viewed as somewhat ineffective, is considered the most dominant ideology in contemporary bourgeois society.
it prioritizes the notion of the 'individual,' particularly in defending the rights of business entrepreneurs to generate profit at the expense of workers.
this emphasis on individualism also extends to matters such as the right to choose, which often leans towards consumerism, like affording private education for one's child over essentials like school meals.
the enduring aspects of the human experience, such as freedom and democracy, are fundamental to our way of life.
this concept of existence is grounded more in practical instincts, biased judgments, and traditional beliefs rather than abstract theoretical principles.
despite its critics, there is still a place for the arts and humanities in society, even in the face of opposition from those in power who benefit from our democratic freedoms.
furthermore, by giving numerous young individuals the opportunity to indulge in reading books and engaging in discussions for an extended period, it is conceivable that, under specific broader historical contexts, they might not just challenge the values passed down to them but also scrutinize the authority through which these values are imparted.
it is completely acceptable for students to question the values they are taught; in fact, this critical thinking is fundamental to higher education.
the ability to think independently, express dissent, and engage in reasoned debate are essential components of a comprehensive education.
as i mentioned previously, no one expects your essay on chaucer or baudelaire to lead to predetermined conclusions – the emphasis is on effectively employing language in an appropriate manner.
achieving certification from the state as proficient in literary studies relies on the ability to communicate and write effectively in particular ways.
the focus lies on teaching, testing, and certifying these skills, rather than on personal opinions and beliefs, which may be influenced by linguistic constraints.
while individuals are free to think and believe as they wish, proficiency in a specific language is crucial.
the content of what is expressed is less of a concern than the ability to articulate within the parameters of a defined discourse.
varied stances, from extreme to moderate, are acceptable as long as they align with and are communicable within the established discourse framework.
literary studies revolve around the signifier, emphasizing form over content.
instructors assessing proficiency in this discourse will prioritize your ability to speak it correctly over the specifics of what was said.
some staunch defenders of the literary canon have, at times, illustrated how literary discourse can be applied to non-literary writing.
this poses a dilemma for literary criticism, which traditionally focuses on literature as its primary subject, despite comprising techniques that can be used beyond literary texts.
for instance, one could attempt a literary critical analysis of social events like parties, discussing their styles, genres, nuances, and sign-systems.
such an exercise can yield insights as profound as analyzing canonical works like shakespeare's.
therefore, literary criticism must confront whether it is equally adept at interpreting parties as it is at interpreting classic literature, risking losing its distinctiveness if it broadens its scope, or recognize that non-literary subjects can be analyzed under different methodologies such as ethnomethodology or hermeneutical phenomenology.
its primary focus is on literature due to its higher value and significance compared to other types of texts subject to critical analysis.
however, this assertion is flawed as it overlooks the potential worth of numerous films and philosophical works that surpass many pieces included in the literary canon.
the exclusion of these works from scholarly examination is not due to their inability to be scrutinized but rather stems from the arbitrary power of the literary establishment.
one more justification why literary criticism cannot simply restrict itself to specific works based on their 'value' is that criticism plays a crucial role in the literary establishment that deems these works as valuable in the first place.
it is not only individuals or elements that are transformed into significant literary entities through particular treatment, but also shakespeare himself.
shakespeare did not start out as exceptional literature waiting to be recognized by the literary institution; rather, he is viewed as remarkable literature because the institution establishes him as such.
this does not imply that he is not genuinely exceptional literature and that it is solely a matter of subjective opinions because literature does not exist in a vacuum as being 'truly' exceptional or 'truly' anything without being influenced by the ways it is perceived within specific social and institutional contexts.
there are countless ways to analyze shakespeare, but not all approaches qualify as literary criticism.
while i have previously mentioned that critical discourse lacks a fixed meaning, it does, in fact, have specific parameters that exclude certain ways of discussing literature.
it also disqualifies various discursive techniques as inappropriate, unauthorized, non-critical, or nonsensical.
its apparent openness regarding meanings is only equaled by its narrow-mindedness regarding expressions.
essentially, different variations of the discourse are recognized and sometimes accepted, but diverging too far risks being seen as speaking an entirely different language.
such deviation highlights that critical discourse holds power.
being entrenched in the discourse blinds one to this power, as it feels natural and non-coercive to express oneself in familiar terms.
critical discourse operates on various levels, demonstrating the power to regulate language by determining which statements are deemed acceptable or not.
it also influences how writing is categorized into literary and non-literary, separating enduring works from passing trends.
the hierarchy within this discourse establishes authority and power dynamics between those who control and shape it and those who are permitted access.
moreover, it evaluates and validates individuals based on their proficiency in engaging with the discourse.
ultimately, the relationship between the academic literary sphere, where these dynamics unfold, and the societal power structures that benefit from maintaining and expanding this discourse, highlights the intricate interplay between intellectual institutions and broader ideological interests.
in my opinion, the most appropriate course of action for it is to acknowledge that literary theory, like literature itself, is essentially an illusion.
while figures like northrop frye and f.
leavis were real individuals, literary theory ultimately reveals itself to be a construct intertwined with social ideologies.
this illusion is underscored by the lack of a distinct identity setting it apart from disciplines like philosophy, linguistics, psychology, and sociology.
additionally, the notion that literary theory can differentiate itself through a focus on literature is misguided.
therefore, this book can be seen not as an introduction, but as a final tribute, signaling the burial of the very subject it sought to uncover.
in essence, my aim is not to oppose the literary theories i have critically evaluated in this book with a literary theory of my own that purports to be more politically correct.
for readers anticipating a marxist theory, it is clear they may not have been fully engaged with the content of this book.
while there are valuable marxist and feminist literary theories that i acknowledge and recommend for further reading in the bibliography, my focus is not to introduce a new theory.
rather, i question whether it is feasible to discuss 'literary theory' without reinforcing the belief that literature is a separate, defined entity of knowledge.
instead, i suggest considering the practical implications of recognizing that literary theory can analyze the works of bob dylan with the same level of competence as those of john milton.
however, does this not risk expanding literary theory to a degree where specificity is compromised?
wouldn't a 'discourse theory' encounter similar methodological and subject study issues as seen in literary studies?
indeed, there exist numerous discourses and approaches to analyzing them.
what distinguishes the study i propose is its focus on discerning the impacts generated by discourses and how they come to be.
while reading a zoology textbook for information on giraffes pertains to zoology studies, delving into its discourse's structure, organization, and evaluating the effects these elements have on specific readers in practical settings constitutes a distinct endeavor.
this approach could be considered one of the earliest forms of 'literary criticism', often referred to as rhetoric.
rhetoric, a prevalent form of critical analysis from ancient times to the eighteenth century, focused on deconstructing discourses to understand how they are structured to achieve specific impacts.
it was inclusive of various forms of communication, such as speaking, writing, poetry, philosophy, fiction, and historiography, aiming to explore the broader spectrum of societal discursive practices.
central to its approach was the recognition of these practices as mechanisms of power and performance.
despite this emphasis, rhetoric did not disregard the truthfulness of the discourses under scrutiny, as this aspect often influenced their effectiveness on audiences.
it differed from being a 'humanism' driven by an intuitive understanding of language experience or a 'formalism' concentrated solely on linguistic analysis during its principal phase.
as with the most effective radical viewpoints, my stance is deeply rooted in tradition.
i aim to steer literary criticism away from current trendy and modern perspectives that have overly focused on literature as a uniquely privileged entity, or on separating the 'aesthetic' from social influences.
instead, i advocate re-embracing the long-abandoned ancient principles of literary critique.
although my approach may seem conservative, i am not suggesting a complete revival of archaic rhetorical terminology to replace modern critical language.
we do not have to undertake this task as the literary theories explored in this book offer a sufficient array of concepts to help us get started.
rhetoric, also known as discourse theory, explores the formal aspects of language, much like formalism, structuralism, and semiotics.
however, similar to reception theory, it also delves into how these aspects influence communication at the point of reception.
its focus on discourse as a tool of power and desire can benefit from insights from deconstruction and psychoanalytical theory.
moreover, its perspective that discourse can be transformative aligns with liberal humanism.
though "literary theory" may be considered illusory, it still provides valuable concepts for an alternate form of discursive practice.
rhetoric undertook the analysis of discourses for a purpose, much like contemporary literary criticism that does not engage with literature without a clear intent.
the study aimed to uncover the most impactful methods for pleading, persuading, and debating.
rhetoricians examined these techniques in others' language to enhance their own skills.
it bridged the gap between creativity and critical thinking, encompassing both effective discourse practice and its theoretical aspects.
similarly, there is value in establishing a study that delves into the diverse sign-systems and practices of significance in our society, ranging from literary works like moby dick to popular shows like the muppet show, and from historic figures like dryden and jean-luc godard to the representation of women in advertisements and the persuasive strategies employed in governmental reports.
as previously discussed, all theories and knowledge are inherently biased, raising the question of their purpose and relevance.
one notable flaw in much formalist and structuralist criticism is their failure to justify their existence.
structuralists often analyze sign-systems without clear justification, leading to a lack of purpose in their approach.
on the other hand, liberal humanists can articulate why studying literature is valuable by arguing that it contributes to personal growth.
however, this emphasis on self-improvement is both the strength and weakness of the liberal humanist perspective.
liberal humanism is a moral ideology predominantly found in suburban settings, focusing primarily on interpersonal issues.
its emphasis tends to be stronger on matters like adultery rather than on issues such as armaments.
while it values concepts like freedom, democracy, and individual rights, these are often seen as lacking practical application.
for instance, its interpretation of democracy is more theoretical, centered on voting, rather than a dynamic and active democracy that also encompasses political entities like the foreign office and corporations like standard oil.
similarly, its notion of individual freedom is abstract, as true freedom is impeded when it relies on the exploitation and suppression of others.
literature may criticize these circumstances, yet its existence itself is intertwined with these very conditions.
according to the german critic walter benjamin, every cultural document reflects an element of barbarism.
socialists aim to apply the theoretical concepts of freedom and democracy endorsed by liberal humanism in practical and tangible ways.
they advocate for a thorough examination of the specific and detailed aspects of these ideals.
many western socialists feel dissatisfied with the liberal humanist perspective on dictatorships in eastern europe, believing that mere emphasis on free speech is insufficient.
they argue that toppling such oppressive regimes would require more than just advocating for free speech; a revolution led by the working class against the state would be essential.
to define what it means to be a 'better person' requires practical and tangible actions that address broader political contexts rather than narrowly focusing on abstract interpersonal relations that can be separated from the bigger picture.
it necessitates a discussion rooted in political rather than solely 'moral' considerations, thereby delving into genuine moral discourse that recognizes the interconnectedness between individual values and the entire fabric of our material existence.
engaging in political debates does not negate moral concerns; rather, it underscores the importance of taking these concerns seriously within their comprehensive framework.
despite the discomfort that liberal humanists may feel at framing it this way, they acknowledge the significance of studying literature not for its literary merits alone, but for its practical utility.
the notion of literature being regarded as having utility might offend traditional literary sensibilities, conjuring images of mundane items like paperclips and hairdryers.
although we may not use moby dick as a practical guide for hunting whales, there is still something valuable to be gained from it.
every literary theory assumes a particular purpose for literature, even if that purpose is to expose its apparent worthlessness.
liberal humanist criticism is not at fault for utilizing literature, but it is mistaken in believing otherwise.
it employs literature to promote specific moral principles, which, as i have attempted to illustrate, are intertwined with certain ideological beliefs and influence the way texts are interpreted.
the criticism is not objective; it interprets texts based on its values, shaping the understanding of the works under examination.
i am not advocating for a 'political criticism' that assesses literary texts through a political lens because all criticism inherently does this.
the notion that there exist criticism forms that are devoid of politics is a fallacy that actually serves to promote certain political agendas within literature more effectively.
the distinction between 'political' and 'non-political' criticism is akin to that between a prime minister and a monarch: the latter advances specific political goals while feigning neutrality, whereas the former is forthright about its agenda.
it is always more prudent to be candid in these discussions.
contrary to popular belief, the difference between a traditional critic discussing the 'chaos of experience' in conrad or woolf and a feminist analyzing the portrayal of gender by these authors does not delineate between apolitical and political criticism.
instead, it reveals varying forms of politics, highlighting individuals who adhere to the belief that history, society, and the entirety of human reality are fragmented, capricious, and without direction, as opposed to those with different interests that imply alternative perspectives on the nature of the world.
there is no definitive answer as to which political stance is preferable in literary criticism.
it essentially boils down to engaging in political discourse to argue and discern varying viewpoints.
the question arises: why is it important to do this?
liberal humanist critics aim not only to provide a comprehensive understanding of literature but also to engage in discussions that can enhance and broaden our lives.
socialist and feminist critics share the same goal, emphasizing that enriching our lives involves transforming a society marked by class and gender divisions.
they urge liberal humanists to consider the broader consequences of their standpoint.
if there is disagreement, it becomes a political debate rather than a discussion about the use of literature.
the discussions, symbolic systems, and ways of communicating in various forms, such as in film, television, literature, and scientific language, all have the ability to influence and shape our consciousness and unconsciousness, thus playing a role in either maintaining or changing existing power structures.
these processes are intrinsically linked to human identity.
the term 'ideology' can be understood simply as the connection between communication and power dynamics.
once this is understood, the approach to theory and methodology can be reconsidered.
it is not about beginning with specific theoretical or methodological issues but rather starting with our objectives and then determining which methods and theories are most suitable to achieve those goals.
choosing a strategy does not dictate the most valuable methods or subjects of study.
the decision on what to investigate largely depends on the practical context in question.
any method or theory that contributes to the strategic objective of human liberation through the transformation of society into a socialist one is deemed acceptable.
approaches such as structuralism, semiotics, psychoanalysis, deconstruction, reception theory, among others, offer valuable insights that can be utilized.
however, not all literary theories align with the intended strategic objectives.
some theories discussed in this book are deemed improbable to serve these goals.
therefore, the decision of which theory to adopt or reject is based on the practical aims one seeks to achieve.
throughout the history of literary criticism, this criterion has always been pertinent, although sometimes not readily acknowledged.
in every academic pursuit, we choose the subjects and methodologies that we consider most crucial, guided by our perspectives shaped by our everyday social experiences.
radical critics share this approach but prioritize social concerns that diverge from prevailing norms.
their viewpoints are often labeled as 'ideological' because the term 'ideology' typically describes the interests of others rather than our own.
no single theory or method can serve only one strategic purpose.
they can be utilized in various strategies for different purposes.
however, not all methods are equally suitable for every purpose.
the key is to explore rather than assume that a single method or theory is sufficient.
the reason i did not conclude this book with discussions of socialist or feminist literary theory is to avoid potentially prompting a 'category mistake'.
such a move could lead readers to believe that 'political criticism' is a distinct type of approach from those previously discussed, differing in assumptions but essentially similar.
as i have established that all criticism is inherently political, and as individuals tend to label criticism as 'political' when it differs from their own beliefs, they cannot be so easily separated.
i refer to "goals" because this type of critique is not limited to just one.
there are multiple objectives to strive for and various methods of attaining them.
in certain scenarios, the most effective approach might involve examining how the symbolic systems of a "literary" work generate specific ideological impacts, or the same could apply to a hollywood movie.
these endeavors can be highly significant when teaching cultural studies to young learners.
it can also be beneficial to utilize literature to nurture in them an appreciation for the linguistic possibilities they may feel are restricted by their social circumstances.
these are "utopian" applications of literature, underpinned by a rich tradition of such idealistic thinking that should not be easily disregarded.
nonetheless, the active appreciation of cultural works should not be limited to elementary education, leaving older students with the potentially more somber task of analysis.
the exploration of pleasure, enjoyment, and the transformative power of communication is equally as appropriate for academic study as examining how puritan writings were influenced by the discourse of the seventeenth century.
while critiquing or enjoying the discourse of others can be beneficial, there is also value in creating one's own discourse.
like in the rhetorical tradition, studying the works of others can be instructive.
by engaging in your own forms of expression, you can enhance, challenge, adjust, or alter the impacts generated by the practices of others.
in the midst of various activities, the examination of what is currently labeled 'literature' holds significance.
however, it should not be automatically assumed that 'literature' will always maintain its predominant focus.
such rigidity has no place in the realm of cultural studies.
furthermore, the texts identified as 'literature' today may undergo reinterpretation and repurposing when reintegrated into broader discursive contexts they are part of.
they will inevitably undergo revisions, repurposing, and be used in different contexts.
while this has always occurred, the label 'literature' sometimes hinders us from acknowledging this reality.
however, prioritizing the current issues should not hinder the exploration of how we could improve the organization of literary studies for the future.
the impact of these departments goes beyond just the values they promote; it also involves separating 'literature' from other cultural and social activities, both implicitly and explicitly.
the concept of considering these activities merely as literary 'background' is dismissive, as 'background' suggests a stagnant and detached role.
any future alternatives to these departments, albeit a modest suggestion as similar experiments are already ongoing in some higher education sectors, would heavily incorporate education on various cultural analysis theories and methodologies.
the failure of many current literature departments to consistently offer or prioritize such education, offering it only optionally or marginally, is viewed as a scandalous and absurd characteristic.
the notion of genteel amateurism, that views criticism as an instinctual sixth sense, has long confused many literature scholars and further solidifies the dominance of those in authority.
if criticism is likened to a mere knack, akin to whistling and humming different tunes simultaneously, then it becomes both rarefied to be monopolized by a select few, yet ordinary enough to evade the need for rigorous theoretical validation.
this dual dynamic is also evident in english 'ordinary language' philosophy.
however, the solution does not lie in replacing this haphazard amateur approach with a polished professionalism that only seeks validation from a disenchanted public.
displaying the same level of expertise, we observe that professional literary criticism lacks social validation for its endeavors.
its purpose seems limited to organizing literature, categorizing texts, and possibly transitioning into the field of marine biology.
if the aim of criticism is not merely interpreting literary works but rather understanding the sign-systems that give rise to them impartially, then what should criticism pursue after attaining such mastery, a feat that may not be overly time-consuming, perhaps not more than a few years?
professionals engaged in cultural practices are aware that their work is not the sole focus of life.
throughout history, the majority of men and women have been unable to fully experience or benefit from cultural pursuits.
it is only through the labor of those not directly involved in cultural endeavors that a fortunate few are currently able to engage in them.
any cultural or critical theory that fails to acknowledge this fundamental reality, and does not prioritize it in its endeavors, is unlikely, in my opinion, to hold much value.
it is essential to recognize that every cultural artifact also reflects elements of barbarism.
even in societies where cultural pursuits are not always prioritized, there are moments when culture becomes exceptionally significant and charged with deeper meaning.
our contemporary world provides notable instances of such moments.
in the context of nations striving for independence from imperialism, culture holds a significance far beyond mere commentary in the sunday newspapers.
imperialism goes beyond exploiting labor, resources, and markets; it also involves eradicating languages and traditions—not just through military occupation but by imposing foreign ways of life.
its impact reaches beyond financial statements and military installations, extending to the core of linguistic and cultural heritage.
in such scenarios, which are not unfamiliar, culture intertwines so deeply with communal identity that its connection to political resistance is inherent and requires no justification.
to argue against this bond would be perplexing.
addressing the 'culture industry', there is a discrepancy in how literary critics foster sensibility among a minority, whereas a significant portion of the media aims to diminish it among the majority.
despite this, there remains a prevailing belief that delving into works like gray and collins holds more significance compared to analyzing television or popular press.
this particular endeavor sets itself apart from the previously discussed projects by its defensive nature, primarily reacting critically to the prevailing cultural ideologies rather than adopting culture for personal purposes.
nonetheless, it is an essential undertaking that should not fall prey to the pessimistic belief that the media is inevitably all-encompassing.
it is evident that individuals do not unquestionably accept all they see or read, but there is a necessity to further understand the influence of such portrayals on their overall consciousness.
this critical analysis, though politically considered as a temporary measure, remains crucial.
the last aspect to consider is the emerging movement of working-class writing, which has long been suppressed and excluded from literary circles.
in recent years in britain, working-class individuals have started to actively come together to develop their unique literary styles and voices, challenging the belief that literature is only for a select few.
this movement, known as the worker writers' movement, remains largely unrecognized by academia and has faced resistance from established cultural institutions.
however, it represents a significant shift in the traditional literary landscape.
alongside this movement, community-based publishing initiatives have also emerged, aiming not just to promote literature with different social values but also to transform the established social dynamics among writers, publishers, readers, and other literary contributors.
by questioning conventional notions of literature, these endeavors resist easy assimilation into mainstream literary establishments that are content with welcoming works like "sons and lovers" and occasionally even those of authors such as robert tressell.
written in 1982, this book marked a pivotal moment bridging two vastly distinct decades.
while it could not predict the future, it also could not fully comprehend the developments in literary theory that would later shape its significance.
according to hegel, true understanding is often retrospective, symbolized by the owl of minerva flying only at night.
the enduring impact of events contributes to their interpretation, yet this interpretation may elude contemporaries.
just as we now possess more insight into the french revolution's consequences than robespierre did, such retrospective knowledge is a part of historical meaning.
as history progresses, our comprehension of it moves backwards, causing us to intersect with our past selves while reflecting on recent history.
the assumed universal value of literature came into question, especially in connection with shifts in the social makeup of universities.
traditionally, students were expected to temporarily set aside their personal histories when analyzing literary texts, viewing them from the perspective of a classless, genderless, non-ethnic, and impartial universal observer.
this was feasible when students shared similar social backgrounds, but individuals from diverse ethnic, working-class, or marginalized groups found it increasingly challenging to relate to these supposedly universal values.
it is no surprise that russian formalists, french structuralists, and german reception theorists gained popularity during this period, as their approaches challenged and deconstructed traditional literary assumptions, appealing to the changing academic landscape.
the concept of a 'science of literature' emerged abruptly, a concept that the humanists found as absurd as a science of sneezing.
structuralists' confidence in precise analysis and universal principles aligned well with the technological era, elevating that scientific reasoning to the inner sanctuary of the human psyche itself, akin to freud's approach with psychoanalysis.
however, paradoxically, this move sought to challenge one of the dominant belief systems of the time, broadly defined as liberal humanism, creating a radical and technocratic fusion.
reception theory dissected the seemingly natural and instinctive act of reading a book, revealing the numerous learned processes and debatable cultural assumptions embedded within it.
a significant portion of the bold theoretical enthusiasm prevalent at that time was about to be challenged.
the theoretical approaches in the early seventies, encompassing marxism, feminism, and structuralism, were inclined towards totalization, aiming to interrogate the prevailing political framework in favor of a more appealing alternative.
these ideologies delved deep into the core issues, aligning with the rebellious political movements of the era in terms of intellectual vigor and courage.
in line with louis althusser's concept, it was a form of political combat on the battleground of theory.
the scope of its aspirations became evident in how it quickly shifted the focus from merely analyzing literature to redefining and shaping the entire academic discipline.
the individuals from the sixties and seventies were also navigating through what was known as popular culture, an element they had to set aside when engaging with texts like jane austen.
following the portuguese revolution in the early 1970s, the momentum of national liberation movements in the third world began to wane.
with social democracy in the west struggling to address the escalating challenges of a capitalism in crisis, right-wing political regimes emerged aiming not only to oppose radical ideologies but also to erase them from collective memory.
by the end of the 1970s, marxist critique was losing popularity as the global capitalist system, under pressure due to the oil crisis of the early 1970s, aggressively confronted revolutionary nationalism in the third world while launching fierce attacks on the labor movement, leftist groups, and liberal ideas domestically.
to add to these challenges, notable figures like roland barthes, michel foucault, louis althusser, and jacques lacan, influential in cultural theory, passed away during this period, further influencing the intellectual landscape.
feminism played a crucial role in upholding the stronghold of political criticism during a time when post-structuralism was thriving.
the peak of post-structuralism coincided with the rise of feminism, suggesting a significant connection between the two movements.
while post-structuralism harbors a radical faction, its overall political stance tends to be subtle and indirect, aligning with the spirit of a post-radical era.
it maintains the critical vigor of previous periods but intertwines it with a skepticism towards fixed truths and meanings, resonating well with a disillusioned liberal mindset.
the core values of post-structuralism, such as questioning semiotic boundaries and metaphysical underpinnings, wariness of dogma or progress narratives, and an openness to pluralistic perspectives, align harmoniously with liberal ideologies.
it presented a shift from theoretical concepts to practical implications, challenging and honoring lived experiences.
by offering a grounded perspective, it aimed to make complex topics like essentialism, conventionalism, identities, and political power more relatable.
moreover, it provided a type of theoretical radicalism and political involvement amid growing skepticism towards traditional left-wing politics, especially in north american societies with fading socialist ideologies.
as socialist influences waned, sexual politics gained prominence in shaping societal discourses.
in the 1970s, discussions on the interplay among signifiers, socialism, and sexuality prevailed, evolving in the 1980s to focus on signifiers and sexuality, and eventually centering largely on sexuality as the 1990s approached.
the shift in theoretical focus from lenin to lacan, benveniste to the body happened unexpectedly, marking an important development in politics.
this transformation not only expanded politics into previously unexplored domains but was also prompted by a standstill in other political arenas.
while feminist theory was influenced by the broader decline in radical politics during the late 1970s and early 1980s, it faced challenges as the women's movement clashed with a conservative, family-centric, and puritanical new right.
this opposition resulted in a series of political setbacks that influenced feminist theorizing.
the peak of feminist theory was experienced in the 1970s, a period now two decades in the past.
since then, the field has seen numerous specific applications of the theory across various general areas and individual authors.
however, there have been limited groundbreaking advancements that could rival the influential contributions of early trailblazers such as moers, millett, showalter, gilbert, gubar, kristeva, irigaray, and cixous.
these pioneers skillfully blended semiotics, linguistics, psychoanalysis, political theory, sociology, aesthetics, and practical criticism.
while significant theoretical advancements have emerged, particularly within the intersection of feminism and psychoanalysis, the overall impact falls short of the intellectual vigor witnessed in earlier years.
the 1970s discussions on the alignment of feminism and marxism have subsided, and by the mid-1980s, the assumption that a feminist, especially in north america, inherently supported the socialist cause had significantly diminished, akin to a phenomenologist's stance.
marxist criticism, which reached its peak in the mid-1970s, has since experienced a decline.
a clear example of this trend is evident in the work of fredric jameson, a prominent marxist literary theorist in the west.
while maintaining his marxist perspective, jameson gradually transitioned towards film theory and postmodernism during the 1980s.
the diminishing influence of marxism preceded the significant events of the late 1980s in eastern europe, where the overthrow of neo-stalinism by democratic socialists signaled the potential for popular revolutions.
the decline of marxist criticism in the west was not solely due to disillusionment with 'actually existing socialism' in the east but was also influenced by the long-held desire of mainstream western marxist factions for such revolutionary changes.
the reduced popularity of marxist criticism post-1970s was influenced predominantly by changes in the first world rather than the second world.
this decline was partly due to the global capitalist crisis mentioned earlier and also because of the critiques directed towards marxism by emerging 'new' political movements.
these movements, including feminism, lgbtq rights, environmentalism, and various ethnic movements, arose following previous working-class activism, nationalist uprisings, civil rights, and student movements.
the earlier endeavors typically involved a clash between large-scale political organizing and oppressive state authority, aiming for sweeping transformations of capitalism, racism, or imperialism on a grand scale.
however, by around 1980, these approaches were perceived as outdated.
as dismantling state power seemed unattainable, the focus shifted toward what was termed as micropolitics.
some anglo-saxon followers reduced deconstruction to a narrow textual inquiry, focusing on analyzing literary works to challenge the established canon.
they continually deconstructed texts, supplying the critical industry with fresh and sophisticated materials.
derrida emphasized the political and historical aspects of his project, though this aspect often did not translate well when transferred from paris to institutions like yale or cornell.
the bold and rebellious deconstructive approach was easily absorbed into a formalist model in these settings.
post-structuralism flourished best when integrated with broader movements such as feminism, post-colonialism, or psychoanalysis.
by the late 1980s, identified deconstructionists were dwindling, particularly after a scandal involving paul de man, a prominent figure in us deconstruction, who was exposed for writing pro-german and anti-semitic articles for belgian journals during world war ii.
the de man scandal seemed to coincide mysteriously with a decline in the intellectual status of a particular sphere.
much of the animosity surrounding the incident stemmed from a sector of theory that felt increasingly marginalized.
deconstruction was criticized, among other things, for being too focused on form and neglecting historical context.
throughout the 1980s, there was a growing trend, especially in the united states, towards embracing some form of historicism.
however, this shift no longer aligned with the discredited historicism of marx or hegel, which relied on grand narratives, teleological aspirations, hierarchical historical causes, and a realist notion of determining the truth regarding historical events, as well as clear distinctions between central and peripheral historical elements.
the new historicism, primarily focusing on the renaissance period, embraced an epistemological skepticism towards fixed historical truths and challenged the dominance of grand narratives.
it viewed history not as a predetermined sequence of causes and effects but as a fluid and contingent interplay of forces that required interpretation by the observer, rather than being taken for granted.
instead of a hierarchy of narratives, history was seen as a complex web of interconnected stories, each with its own significance, all influenced by the biases and interests of the present.
this approach blurred the distinction between major historical events and seemingly less important details, as well as between objective facts and imaginative storytelling.
events of the past were considered as textual constructs, akin to literary works treated as tangible occurrences.
historiography was understood as a form of storytelling shaped by the narrator's perspectives and concerns, thus seen as a rhetorical or fictional endeavor in itself.
the emergence of new historicism can be characterized as having been influenced by a pluralist approach, where any subject matter linked to michel foucault or relevant to contemporary american culture was deemed worth exploring.
this movement often focused more on issues related to modern-day california radicals rather than the historical contexts of the elizabethan or jacobean eras.
stephen greenblatt, a prominent figure in this school, transitioned from the teachings of raymond williams to those of michel foucault, signifying a shift from political optimism to pessimism that mirrored the changing societal attitudes of the 1980s, particularly in the era of reaganism in the united states.
the new historicism critiqued the past through the lens of the present.
however, it did so in a way that did not always portray itself favorably or allow for self-criticism and reflection on its own historical context.
it is a common observation that historical perspectives often avoid analyzing their own historical circumstances.
similar to many postmodern ideologies, it tended to present its views as universal while overlooking its specific origins within a particular segment of the western intellectual left.
it may be simpler in california to perceive history as arbitrary and lacking direction compared to less privileged regions globally, just as virginia woolf found it easier to see life as fragmented and disorganized than her household staff might have.
seen through one lens, this ideology can be perceived as either enhancing or weakening classical marxism.
it enhances it by boldly extending materialism to encompass even the 'spiritual' realm, yet weakens it by blurring the fundamental distinctions between the economic and cultural aspects, which are pivotal in orthodox marxism.
as williams himself asserted, the approach is 'compatible' with marxism but diverges from traditional marxism that diminished the significance of culture as merely 'superstructural.' this stance aligns with the new historicism's rejection of such hierarchies and, akin to this movement, embraces a broader spectrum of themes such as sexuality, feminism, ethnic studies, and post-colonialism – areas typically overlooked in traditional marxist criticism.
some individuals considered the enlightenment concept of justice and autonomy as a thing of the past, believing that history had reached its conclusive end, while others, less dramatic in their views, acknowledged that significant ethical and political dilemmas persisted in theory due to unresolved practical issues.
post-structuralism, sensing this predicament, began to incline slightly toward ethical considerations.
however, it faced tough competition from the longstanding german tradition of philosophical exploration from hegel to habermas, which, albeit abstractly, rigorously delved into these themes, generating a substantial body of systematic reflections on them.
so far, we have briefly discussed the term 'postmodernism' without fully exploring its implications.
undoubtedly, it is one of the most prevalent terms in cultural theory today, attempting to encompass a wide range of phenomena from madonna to meta-narratives, post-fordism to pulp fiction.
this breadth risks rendering the term devoid of clear meaning.
it is essential to differentiate between the broader, historical or philosophical concept of 'postmodernity' and the narrower, more cultural or aesthetic concept of 'postmodernism'.
postmodernity signifies the departure from the ideals of modernity, characterized by overarching narratives of truth, reason, science, progress, and universal emancipation that have defined modern thought since the enlightenment.
postmodernity rejects these ideals as they not only have been proven historically unattainable but were inherently flawed from their inception, attempting to confine the complexity of history within rigid frameworks.
these repressive systems ignore the diversity and intricacy of genuine historical events, homogenize differences, reduce uniqueness to sameness, and often lead to oppressive political systems.
in stark contrast to the dangerously absolutist faith that our diverse forms of life and knowledge can be rooted in a single, flawless principle such as reason or historical laws, technology, political utopia, or universal human nature, postmodernity of the 'anti-foundationalist' inclination asserts that our ways of life are relative, unsupported, self-sufficient constructs shaped by cultural conventions and traditions, lacking any clear origin or lofty objective.
particularly within the conservative strains of this philosophy, 'theory' often serves as a facade for legitimizing these established customs and structures.
while we are incapable of basing our actions on reason due to the existence of varying, distinct, and possibly incomparable rational frameworks, our justifications will inevitably be influenced by underlying factors such as power dynamics, beliefs, interests, or desires that elude rational explanation.
human life lacks an overarching totality, rationality, or fixed center.
there is no universal language capable of encapsulating its infinite diversity.
instead, we encounter a multitude of cultures and narratives that cannot be ranked hierarchically or distinguished as 'privileged.' hence, it is imperative to acknowledge and honor the inherent 'otherness' of practices different from our own.
knowledge is contingent upon cultural frameworks, making the notion of understanding the world 'as it is' illusory.
our comprehension is forever tinted by subjective interpretations, just as the world itself lacks a definitive essence.
truth emerges through interpretation, facts are molded by discourse, and objectivity is merely a transient interpretation that holds sway.
the human subject is no less of a fabrication than the reality they ponder – an amorphous, internally conflicted entity devoid of a fixed nature.
underpinning all this lies the conviction that postmodernity essentially echoes friedrich nietzsche's philosophical tenets from nineteenth-century europe.
distrustful of singular identities and skeptical of the concept of definite origins, postmodernism highlights its own 'intertextual' essence by playfully reusing elements from other works, which themselves are also recycled materials.
it satirizes historical narratives as a timeless resource detached from linear causality, mixing past remnants with contemporary elements.
furthermore, it challenges the conventional boundary between 'high' and 'popular' art forms, blurring the distinction by creating culturally accessible artifacts that invite enjoyable consumption.
postmodernism, paralleling walter benjamin's idea of 'mechanical reproduction,' aims to break down the exclusivity of high modernist culture through a more approachable and user-friendly aesthetic, questioning the privileged nature of value hierarchies.
in this perspective, there is no hierarchy of better or worse; instead, there is pure diversity.
postmodernism is perceived by some as a modern-day revival of the avant-garde movement, which historically aimed to bridge the gap between art and everyday life.
this movement is evident in various aspects of society like advertising, fashion, lifestyle, shopping malls, and mass media, where aesthetics and technology have merged.
political activities have also evolved into a form of aesthetic presentation.
postmodernism's departure from traditional aesthetic standards materialized through cultural studies, which gained prominence in the 1980s and frequently disregarded distinctions in value between high and low forms of art such as sonnets and soap operas.
various debates have emerged surrounding postmodernism and postmodernity, each taking diverse perspectives.
it raises questions about the extent and depth of these developments, whether they encompass the entirety of contemporary culture or are more specific and segmented.
is postmodernity a suitable philosophy for our era, or is it merely a viewpoint imposed by disillusioned former revolutionary western intellectuals onto current history?
how does postmodernism manifest in places like mali or mayo?
how is it perceived in societies that are yet to fully embrace modernity?
does postmodernism impartially describe consumerist societies, or does it endorse a particular lifestyle?
is it, as fredric jameson argues, a cultural phenomenon resulting from late capitalism's commodification of culture, or, as its proponents argue, a rebellious rejection of elites, hierarchies, overarching narratives, and absolute truths?
the debate surrounding postmodernism is expected to persist due to its solid foundation in social practices and institutions.
while many may choose to overlook concepts like phenomenology, semiotics, or reception theory, consumerism, media influence, aestheticized politics, and sexual differences remain central issues addressed by postmodernism.
moreover, the ongoing discussions are fueled by internal disagreements within postmodern theory.
politically inclined supporters of postmodernism seek to debunk traditional notions such as truth, identity, and metanarratives to pave the way for more effective radical initiatives.
conversely, conservative advocates of postmodernism discard these ideas to uphold the existing political framework.
this division is evident in the contrasting views of prominent postmodern figures like foucault and stanley fish, derrida and richard rorty, despite all falling under the broad category of postmodernists.
according to american neo-pragmatists like rorty and fish, the breakdown of transcendental perspectives signifies the disappearance of the ability to engage in a thorough political critique.
the argument posits that any critique would necessitate a viewpoint that is metaphysical and outside our current existence, which is neither feasible nor relevant to us.
hence, even our most radical assertions are inevitably influenced by the prevailing discourses.
essentially, we are deeply embedded within the culture we aim to critique, shaped by its values and interests to such an extent that challenging them requires stepping outside of our own identities.
when our expressions remain coherent, aligning with the prevailing culture, any criticism failing to do so would be ineffectual, rendering us complicit with the very culture we wish to scrutinize, leading to a form of self-deception.
we are expected to accept, in a highly improbable manner, that multinational capitalism is merely a haphazard combination of various practices, techniques, and social relationships, without any coherent rationale.
this argument is often presented as a 'radical' endorsement of diversity in opposition to the threats of complete standardization.
such a belief may find more support at columbia university than in the actual latin american country bearing that name.
by the mid-1990s, feminist criticism had emerged as one of the most favored literary approaches, closely followed by the rising influence of post-colonial theory.
similar to feminism and postmodernism but distinct from phenomenology or reception theory, post-colonial theory is deeply grounded in historical contexts.
this includes the decline of european empires, the ascendancy of the united states in the global economy, the diminishing significance of nation-states and conventional borders, the surge in worldwide migrations and the formation of multicultural societies, the heightened exploitation of ethnic groups within western nations, the growing potency of emerging societies, and the dominance of transnational corporations.
these significant developments since the 1960s have triggered a profound transformation in our perceptions of space, authority, language, and personal identity.
given that culture, in a broad sense, plays a significant role in these matters, it is not surprising that over the past two decades, these issues have greatly impacted the humanities disciplines traditionally focused on culture in a narrower sense.
just as the rise of mass media prompted a reassessment of traditional beliefs, the emergence of multiculturalism, within the same timeframe, challenges western ideas of identity and the established artistic canon.
both cultural studies and post-colonialism represent a shift towards more profound theoretical inquiries beyond earlier literary theories.
the current focus revolves around questioning the notion of 'culture' itself, expanding beyond individual works of art to encompass lifestyle, societal values, group identities, and inevitably intertwining with issues of global political influence.
psychoanalytic concepts like 'splitting' and projection, denial and disavowal, have evolved beyond traditional freudian interpretations to now encompass the analysis of psycho-political dynamics between colonizers and the colonized.
discussions surrounding 'modernity' versus 'postmodernity' hold particular significance in peripheral cultures increasingly influenced by a postmodern western ideology, despite not fully experiencing a european-style modernity themselves.
women in these societies, compelled to bear a significant portion of oppressive burdens, have sparked a productive partnership between feminism and post-colonialism.
post-colonial theory does not solely stem from multiculturalism and decolonization but also signifies a transition from revolutionary national to a 'post-ism' in the third world, a shift that wavered in the 1970s amidst the seemingly unassailable power of transnational corporations.
consequently, much post-colonial literature aligns with postmodern skepticism towards organized mass politics, pivoting towards cultural themes.
while culture is undeniably significant in a neo-colonial context, it is not the ultimate determinant.
ultimately, factors such as commodity prices, raw materials, labor markets, military alliances, and political influences shape the interactions between wealthy and impoverished nations.
in the western world, particularly in the united states, ethnic considerations have both enriched a radical social class-driven politics and, in their exclusive emphasis on differences, obscured the shared material circumstances across various ethnic groups.
while post-colonial theory highlights diversity, it occasionally oversimplifies by grouping disparate societies together as the 'third world'.
its complex language can seem disconnected from the people it aims to support.
despite some groundbreaking ideas, certain aspects of the theory merely mirror western liberalism's self-reproach amid challenging political circumstances, striving to distance itself from its own identity.
in contemporary society, cultural theory itself has emerged as a glamorous commodity.
postmodern theory is not merely a contemplation of the postmodern marketplace; it is an active participant within it.
it offers a means of accumulating valuable 'cultural capital' in increasingly competitive intellectual landscapes.
due to its intellectual prowess, esoteric nature, timeliness, scarcity, and novelty, theory has gained significant prestige in academic circles, despite facing opposition from traditional liberal humanism.
post-structuralism is portrayed as more captivating than philip sidney, just as quarks outshine quadrilaterals.
theory is indicative of the commercialization of intellectual pursuits in our era, where one conceptual trend swiftly replaces another, akin to changes in fashion.
similar to the aestheticization of the human body in contemporary times, theory now occupies a realm of minority art-form characterized by playfulness, self-irony, and hedonism, embodying the artistic impulses that were once associated with high modernism.
at times, it has served as a sanctuary for western intellects left adrift by the harsh realities of contemporary history, which have severed them from their customary humanistic foundations.
this intellect is characterized as simultaneously impressionable and refined, savvy yet bewildered.
it has frequently assumed the role of a trendy alternative to engaging in political endeavors, especially during an era when such engagement has been scarce.
initially conceived as an ambitious critique of prevailing lifestyles, there is now a risk of it evolving into a smug endorsement of the status quo.
there is a lack of distinct coherence within the discipline, as evidenced by the question of what commonalities exist between phenomena like phenomenology and queer theory.
moreover, the methods associated with literary theory are not exclusive to the study of literature but have origins in diverse fields.
this lack of clear boundaries also signifies a shift in the conventional division of intellectual work, highlighted by the term 'theory.' the use of 'theory' implies a crisis in the traditional organization of knowledge due to significant historical developments.
it reflects a reconfiguration of the field, indicating that the humanities could no longer continue in their established format.
this situation had its advantages, as the humanities had frequently promoted a false impartiality, advocated for 'universal' values that were actually culturally specific, ignored the material foundations of these values, excessively emphasized the significance of 'culture', and encouraged an elitist view of it.
conversely, it also had drawbacks, as the humanities had preserved certain noble, charitable values often dismissed by mainstream society; offered a critical assessment of our present lifestyle, admittedly in an idealized form; and through cultivating a spiritual elitism, had at least recognized the insincere equality promoted in commercial environments.
the primary goal of cultural theory, in a broad sense, was to dismantle the conventional wisdom of the classical humanities.
it could be argued that, in theory if not always in practice, it has achieved a reasonable level of success.
since the publication of this book, there have been few compelling responses to the various arguments presented by literary theory.
much of the resistance to theory seems to stem from a common discomfort, particularly among anglo-saxon circles, with abstract concepts and a belief that such theoretical ideas have little relevance to artistic endeavors.
this apprehension toward ideas is a characteristic trait of social groups who currently hold dominant beliefs, mistakenly perceiving them as natural sentiments or eternal truths.
those in authoritative positions often exhibit a dismissive attitude towards criticism and theoretical analyses, a luxury not afforded to those under their jurisdiction.
criticisms claiming that theory merely obstructs understanding with complex terminology could be leveled against all forms of criticism.
even some relatively conservative critics nowadays are less inclined to argue that radical theorists are ideologically myopic while asserting their own clarity in understanding the work.
a more extensive form of historicism has become prevalent, with fewer strict formalists remaining.
while the author is still relevant, a simplistic focus on the author's life is no longer trendy.
the uncertainty of literary canons and their reliance on culturally specific values is widely acknowledged today, as well as the realization that certain social groups have been unfairly marginalized from these canons.
the distinction between high culture and popular culture is no longer clearly defined.
in contemporary times, the relevance of literature is significant primarily because it is viewed by many traditional critics as one of the few remaining arenas where a sense of universal worth can still be found in a world that is divided and fragmented.
moreover, literature offers a rare glimpse of transcendence in a society that is overly focused on materialism.
this may explain the intense, almost aggressive fervor evoked by seemingly niche academic pursuits such as literary theory.
should even this fragile bastion of art be subjected to historicization, material analysis, or deconstruction, one might wonder where to seek value in a world that appears to be in decline.
the radical perspective challenges the notion that societal existence is uniformly debased with culture being the sole bastion of worth, suggesting that such a stance is more a reflection of a specific political ideology than an objective truth.
however, the faith in shared values by humanists should also be acknowledged for its inherent optimism and generosity.
the individual might mistakenly consider a project that is still in progress as one that unites the world politically and economically based on 'universal' values in a world that has not been restructured yet.
the humanist is justified in believing in the potential of such universal values.
however, the exact nature of these values remains uncertain as the necessary material conditions for their development are not yet established.
once these conditions materialize, the theorist can happily stop theorizing, as their ideas would become outdated once politically implemented, allowing them to engage in more intriguing activities.
this bibliography is intended for readers interested in exploring the different areas of literary theory covered in the book.
the works are arranged under each category not alphabetically, but rather in a sequence suitable for beginners.
it includes all the works mentioned in the book along with some additional items, yet the list is kept concise and manageable.
most of the works listed are in english, with a few exceptions.
whether as straightforward as the cogito or more intricate, all arguments rely fundamentally on intuitive judgments that connect conclusions to given premises.
essentially, we propose that arguments do not stem from a distinct system 2 process dedicated to explicit reasoning, functioning separately from a system 1 process for intuitive inference.
rather, arguments result from one of several mechanisms for intuitive inference, shaping intuitions about how premises relate to conclusions.
the assessment of arguments involves a subjective element: some arguments are perceived as strong while others as weak.
furthermore, conflicting arguments with opposing conclusions may emerge, and individuals may instinctively favor one over the other.
these assessments and inclinations are fundamentally rooted in intuition.
this section discusses evidence demonstrating that individuals are adept at arguing, employing reasoning to assess and construct arguments within argumentative settings.
while this aligns with various explanations of the primary purpose of reasoning, the significance of this evidence lies in challenging the prevalent belief that people lack proficiency in arguing.
disproving this notion is vital, as if it were accurate, the argumentative theory would be rendered ineffective.
it is essential to establish that individuals possess strong argumentative abilities, beginning with their capacity to comprehend and appraise arguments.
upon arrival at the laboratory, participants were informed that they would be assigned to either a short and enjoyable task or a long and challenging task.
they were then given the opportunity to select which task they preferred, knowing that the other task would be assigned to a different participant.
alternatively, they could opt for a computer to randomly assign the tasks.
following the task assignment, participants were required to assess the fairness of their decision-making process.
in contrast, some participants did not have a say in the task allocation process and had to rate the fairness of the participant who made the assignments, being fully informed of the circumstances under which the decisions were made.
in essence, it is crucial to investigate how argumentation could be utilized in these conducive and supportive circumstances, rather than just in typical situations.
if this wider adoption were to become customary, the argumentative capabilities of future generations could be limitless.
with educational systems across the globe emphasizing the importance of students effectively utilizing their intellect to tackle novel challenges, it is essential to thoroughly consider this prospect.
defining collective memory as a social phenomenon poses challenges for social scientists due to its intricate connections with myth and history, as well as its diverse functions, levels, and interpretations.
the complexity of delineating collective memory is compounded by the varied nature of individual recollections, encompassing autobiographical, cognitive, habitual memory, in addition to the focal point of our discussion, collective or social memory.
while collective memory originates socially and is influenced by prevailing discourses, memory also resides within individual minds.
although individuals are the agents of remembrance, the act of remembering transcends personal boundaries, with even the most intimate memories being shaped by the social environment through factors like language, rituals, and commemorative practices.
one additional assumption regarding democracy and memory is that individuals who have firsthand experience with democracy and can recall those experiences play a crucial role in upholding the stability of this form of government.
this assertion is more grounded in history than in theory, as historical evidence showcases how a shared memory of past democratic practices contributes to perpetuating the legitimacy of democracy, fostering admiration for its institutions, and promoting principles of moderation.
it seems evident that a collective recollection of a tangible democratic past serves to bolster the resilience of a democratic system.
in the following section, we elucidate the theoretical rationale supporting the empirical advancements, focusing specifically on several key empirical challenges.
in section three, we evaluate previous studies and analyze estimations derived from multiple datasets and scenarios within the uk.
section 4 delves into the significance of education as a signaling mechanism and its impact on wage levels.
furthermore, section 5 addresses the question of variability in the returns on education, exploring how individuals' differing abilities to leverage education for productivity enhancements may result in varied returns.
lastly, section 6 presents our concluding remarks.
another method to differentiate between ability and productivity involves including direct ability measures.
the challenge with using ability controls lies in ensuring that the measures of ability are not influenced by education and do not inadvertently capture the productivity-boosting impacts of education.
additionally, these ability measures must reflect the capacity to generate income rather than simply measuring iq levels.
it appears to be a formidable task to find an ability measure that meets both criteria perfectly, and in this study, we delve into this issue using two specific datasets.
by comparing results with controls at age 11 and age 16 in the ncds, and incorporating ability information from the current age in the ials, we observed that introducing ability controls at older ages can distort the influence of education on ability scores, leading to a more pronounced apparent bias.
consequently, findings at age 7 likely offer the most precise estimates of how education reflects innate ability.
surprisingly, these results indicate a marginal discrepancy, implying limited signaling efficacy of education.
the coalition model emphasizes the significant role that activist groups can play in both the production and distribution processes of documentary films, highlighting their potential as catalysts for political change.
through an analysis of three case studies, this model proves effective in mobilizing and educating activist groups, as well as influencing public policy agendas and discussions.
such findings underscore the strategic importance of political communication and add valuable insights to current debates surrounding media effects.
the significance of these two studies lies in their ability to offer insights into a more comprehensive understanding of the impact, going beyond just individual citizens' attitude and knowledge alterations.
particularly, the studies partly underscore the relevance of the viewing context, the dynamics of interpersonal conversations post-viewing, and the media portrayal of the film.
for instance, feldman and sigelman noted the provision of a panel discussion following the film screening, which complemented the viewing experience.
despite examining its influence, they discovered that the panel discussion had minimal effects.
the coalition model expands our perspective in three key ways.
firstly, it encompasses the complete filmmaking journey, from production to distribution, rather than just concentrating on the end result.
the evolution, production, and distribution of a film offer ample chances for engagement among producers, participants, activists, decision-makers, and citizens.
the solitary viewer watching the completed film in a cinema or on tv signifies merely the concluding phase of an extensive process.
in the summer of 1993, maxcine mitchell, a former chair of the resident association for a public housing community and an amateur videographer, was approached by kathy gomez, a resident representative in the city-wide resident council.
gomez, dissatisfied with the poor living conditions in her apartment and the lack of response to her concerns, invited mitchell to use her newly acquired video camera to document the maintenance issues in her unit.
mitchell's video of the substandard conditions in public housing had a significant impact, boosting activist groups and prompting changes in public policy in chapel hill.
mitchell's simple yet impactful video production highlighted the transformative influence that such initiatives can have on both producers and advocacy organizations.
the documentary debuted at the greens' christmas party in 1992 before its public premiere at a unitarian fellowship in milwaukee.
the distribution phase was characterized by a substantial public outreach campaign involving a diverse coalition opposing mining activities.
this coalition comprised environmentalists, native american tribes, sportfishing organizations, labor unions, students, and other stakeholders.
the greens oversaw the distribution of the tape, advertised in community and environmental publications, and successfully sold more than 500 copies over time.
the project had a profound influence on a labor activist, fundamentally altering her organizing approach.
utilizing the documentary as a focal point in her advocacy work, she came to appreciate the potency of such presentations, especially when amplifying the voices of the working class – her target audience.
recognizing its potential, she saw the project as a tool in advancing the discourse on contentious matters within public forums.
likewise, fellow activists drew inspiration from the film, fostering a stronger affinity with historical activists who battled similar challenges.
the documentary evolved into an educational tool for labor activists across the southeast, enlightening them about the events of 1934 and igniting a passion for sharing labor movement knowledge with others.
union leaders, such as the seiu and unite, utilized the film internally to deepen the understanding of union members regarding the rich heritage of labor activism in the southeast.
the unions aimed to transform community perspectives on the legitimacy of organized labor by showcasing the extensive history of unionization in the region and the challenges it faced.
as a result of the documentary, labor advocates and historians were inspired to delve further into the histories of labor movements in their respective areas, leading to increased recognition of strikes and labor-related initiatives during the 1930s and beyond.
notably, the collaborative approach to both the production and distribution of the film fostered significant networking among diverse activists and organizers.
throughout the production phase, labor historians, union advocates, and community members collaborated to delve into local events, often forging new partnerships and connections among individuals who had not previously interacted or were unfamiliar with each other and their organizations.
regarding the reform of public housing, it is evident that the video played a vital role, possibly serving as the focal point of the campaign.
in the case of the monument dedicated to the strikers, the essential public discourse that led to the initiative would not have occurred without the documentary.
the impact of the danielson documentary on the campaign for a mining moratorium in wisconsin is less certain.
although the documentary helped elevate the issue's importance in the state, its influence on legislative discussions seems to have been limited.
another crucial factor to consider is the selection of activist groups that opt to showcase a documentary.
after production, these groups and individuals can utilize the documentary to establish a platform where the public, as well as decision-makers, can engage with, deliberate upon, and potentially take action on the highlighted issues.
the extent of impact largely depends on the number of groups involved and their financial and organizational capacities.
furthermore, the efficacy of impact is influenced by the innovativeness and assertiveness demonstrated by these groups in reaching out to grassroots audiences and creating suitable spaces for screening the documentary.
the broader and more varied the viewership, the greater the potential impact.
the instances in the case studies illustrate how presenters effectively leveraged a diverse range of public venues such as community festivals, governmental and community assemblies, bars, shopping centers, libraries, churches, and museums.
georg simmel's work "the philosophy of money" offers a profound and extensive exploration of the social, psychological, and philosophical dimensions of the monetary system.
simmel delves into a meticulous examination of commodity circulation and exchange, delving into the intersections of money with human identity, the role of women, personal autonomy, and other fundamental aspects of human life.
his reflections yield a collection of illuminating perspectives on the structures of social connections, providing a thorough analysis of the intricate interplay among a wide range of seemingly disparate social and cultural aspects.
the initial two chapters and a portion of the third chapter were translated by tom bottomore, while david frisby translated the remaining chapters.
i am grateful to glyn adey for providing me with an initial translation of selected parts of this volume.
our profound gratitude is owed to the late kaethe mengelberg, who initially produced a draft of the entire volume.
without the foundation laid by this earlier work, completing the current translation would have been uncertain.
hence, this translation is dedicated in her honor.
nevertheless, simmel's approach sets him apart from others as he does not limit his focus to a particular historical period.
instead, he seeks to uncover a comprehensive web of meanings that illuminate the significance of the money economy in its entirety.
as life becomes increasingly objectified, individuality is marginalized from its experiences and behaviors, leaving less space for the expression of one’s personality in this context.
simultaneously, this shift enables and even encourages the innermost essence of the soul to detach itself entirely from external circumstances, turning inward.
simmel also notes that this progression towards internalization is essential, despite conflicting with traditional aesthetic values of outward expression in life.
i foresee ongoing challenges ahead because i firmly believe that my adherence to relativism hinges on its ability to adequately address all the issues posed by absolutist theories.
simmel asserts that various aspects of cultural life are intricately connected to each other and cannot be isolated from their surrounding contexts.
this interconnectedness is evident either through analyzing the fundamental relationships among diverse phenomena or by illustrating the similar structures shared by different social phenomena.
this intricate web of relationships exists within a dehistoricized social process that omits contradictions, portraying society as a unified and harmonious entity.
one aspect to consider is the prerequisites that, rooted in mental states, social relations, and the logical framework of reality and values, confer meaning and practical importance to money.
the focus here is not on tracing the roots of money, as that falls under the domain of history rather than philosophy.
while acknowledging the value of understanding a concept through its historical evolution, its true significance and relevance often stem from conceptual, psychological, or ethical associations, detached from temporal aspects and based more on material considerations.
these relationships, although influenced by historical events, transcend mere happenstance.
the importance, integrity, and relevance of justice, religion, or knowledge are not solely confined to their historical realization.
the initial section of this book thus explores the link between money and the conditions that define its essence and significance.
in terms of methodology, this fundamental objective can be articulated in the following way.
the aim is to create a new foundation beneath historical materialism that retains the explanatory power of integrating economic life into the influences on intellectual culture, while also acknowledging that these economic structures are a reflection of deeper values and currents of psychological or even metaphysical origins.
this reciprocal process must be cultivated for cognitive practice.
every analysis of an abstract framework through an economic lens should prompt a consideration of the underlying ideal principles, which in turn should be traced back to the broader economic foundation, and so on indefinitely.
through this interplay and interweaving of opposing cognitive principles, the unity of phenomena, which may seem elusive to our understanding yet underpins its coherence, becomes tangible and essential for us in practical terms.
the intentions and methods mentioned here would lack any foundational justification if they could not cater to a wide range of fundamental philosophical beliefs.
it is feasible to link the intricacies of life to its deepest and most vital movements and analyze them in a way that aligns with life’s overall meaning, whether seen through the lens of idealism or realism, rationality or volition, absolutism or relativism.
these investigations are rooted in one of these worldviews, which i find to be the most fitting representation of the current trends in science and emotions, decisively rejecting opposing perspectives.
even if they end up being mere examples lacking factual accuracy, they reveal their methodological importance as blueprints for future truths.
nature appears to present objects to us sometimes with great significance while at other times withholding them without any evident reason.
the occasional alignment between the two series—what we deem valuable and what reality grants us—highlights the lack of a clear logical connection between them as prominently as instances when they diverge.
despite perceiving certain life experiences as both real and valuable, the significance differs significantly between the two scenarios.
natural occurrences can be fully detailed without touching upon the value of entities, and our valuation system retains its relevance regardless of the frequency or presence of these objects in reality.
value serves as an augmentation to the inherently definitive objective existence, akin to the introduction of light and shadow originating from external sources.
it is crucial, however, to avoid misunderstanding that the development of value concepts, as a psychological phenomenon, is distinct from natural processes.
a hypothetical superhuman intellect capable of understanding all events in the world according to natural laws would also grasp the presence of human value concepts.
however, these concepts would hold no importance or validity for a being viewing them purely theoretically, detached from their psychological essence.
the essence of value concepts is deemed incompatible with nature as a mechanical causal system, despite the fact that the psychological experiences defining values are intrinsic to the natural realm.
the process of valuation as a genuine psychological phenomenon forms part of the natural order; yet the conceptual essence of valuation, its meaning, exists independently of this realm, transcending it to provide a holistic perspective.
we often overlook the fact that our consciousness revolves around experiencing and evaluating values – infusing life with relevance and depth by recognizing that the infinite array of values within the objectively unfolding elements of reality surpasses their material essence.
the importance of this requirement, which shapes our worldview, remains unaffected by our often inadequate ability to determine the reality of concepts or to definitively assess the value of things in a consistently universal manner.
beyond the realm of mere objective qualities and determinations lies the overarching categories of being and value, encompassing forms that draw from the realm of pure contents.
these categories are essentially fundamental, not reducible to each other or to simpler elements.
as a result, the existence of objects cannot be logically deduced; rather, it is a primary aspect of our perception that can be sensed, experienced, and believed, but not derived for those who do not yet grasp it.
if we acknowledge the existence of value, we can rationally comprehend its realization and evolution, as it generally aligns with the structure of reality.
however, the presence of value itself is a fundamental occurrence.
inferences about value reveal the conditions for its realization, without being causally determined by these conditions, similar to how theoretical proofs establish conditions conducive to affirmation or existence.
the nature of value, like that of existence, remains a mystery.
due to their similar formal relationships with objects, questions about value and being are unanswerable and separate, analogous to thought and extension in spinoza's philosophy.
these concepts, representing the same absolute substance in distinct yet perfect ways, do not interfere with each other, as they approach object concepts from divergent perspectives.
the fusion of perception and appreciation, orchestrated by the soul, might find eventual alignment within a metaphysical entity that transcends language, necessitating the use of religious imagery for representation.
it is a conceivable concept that there exists a cosmic realm where the apparent discrepancies between reality and value are eradicated, unveiling both as interconnected forces; a unity that remains aloof from these distinctions and transcends them with grand indifference, or portrays a seamless blend of both, only fractured and obscured by our flawed perception as if our vision is impaired.
the concept of value is initially characterized by its subjectivity, which is distinguished by its lack of direct attachment to objects, unlike attributes such as color or temperature.
while color and temperature are perceived through our senses with a sense of direct connection to the object, value is detached from this sensory link as the realms of reality and value are seen as independent of each other.
exceptions to this general characterization arise with instances where psychological elements seem to suggest a contrasting perspective.
this fundamental relationship between subject and object manifests itself again on a larger scale: the intellectual landscape of classical antiquity fundamentally contrasts with that of modern times primarily due to the fact that only the latter has fully developed a comprehensive and distinct concept of the self, demonstrated by the importance of the issue of freedom, which was not a concern in ancient civilizations.
furthermore, modern times have articulated the autonomy and potency of the concept of objectivity through the notion of immutable natural laws.
in contrast, antiquity was more aligned with a period of indifference where the constituents of the world were perceived simply as they were, without distinct delineations between subject and object.
certainly, when considering a purely objective content, it transforms into a conception and thus takes on a subjective framework to some extent.
however, in this context, the subjective aspect merely represents the active process of conceptualizing, the mechanism through which the content is grasped.
the content itself is perceived as existing independently from the act of conceptualization.
our minds possess a remarkable capacity to regard content as separate from the act of cognition, a fundamental attribute that cannot be further dissected.
these contents have their own conceptual and objective attributes and connections that can be understood but not entirely assimilated; they persist whether they are within our mental representation or part of objective reality.
the content of a representation does not align perfectly with how the contents are represented.
the basic undifferentiated concept which merely involves discerning a content cannot be labeled as subjective as it has not yet discerned the distinction between subject and object.
similarly, the pure content of objects or concepts is not objective, as it transcends this dualistic nature and can manifest in either form.
subject and object originate simultaneously: logically, initially presenting the ideal conceptual content as a representative content, and subsequently as an objective reality; psychologically, when the initial representation without a defined ego, where individual and object are undistinguished, becomes fragmented, establishing a separation between the self and the object, transforming them into distinct entities.
the process that ultimately shapes our intellectual worldview also manifests in our volitional practical endeavors.
in this realm, the distinction between the subject desiring, consuming, and valuing, and the object being valued, doesn't encapsulate every facet of mental life or all the external factors involved in practical activities.
human pleasure in an object is a unified experience devoid of a sense of the object opposing us or a clear self-awareness separate from the current state.
this experience engulfs phenomena ranging from the most basic impulses to the most profound aesthetic appreciations.
whether it's a raw, impersonal impulse seeking gratification without regard for self or object, or a profound aesthetic experience, the focus remains solely on the satisfaction aspect without much consideration for the agent or the object.
to reiterate the earlier analogy: ultimately, reality may not manifest in our awareness through the resistance exerted by phenomena.
rather, we perceive representations with feelings of resistance and inhibition as objectively real, separate from ourselves.
objects are not prized for their rarity, but rather we deem them valuable when they challenge our acquisition.
when desires are met with obstacles and thwarted, the objects assume a significance that wouldn't have been assigned by an unrestrained will.
the concept of value emerges simultaneously with the desiring ego during the process of differentiation and is linked to another category, similar to the one applied to objects in theoretical representations.
this implies that contents manifested in the objective world and within us as subjective representations also possess a distinct ideal worth.
symbols like the triangle or the organism, causality or the law of gravitation possess inherent logical significance and structural validity that determines their manifestation in both space and consciousness.
even if these symbols were never actualized, they would still fall under the fundamental, unanalyzable category of what is valid and meaningful, setting them apart from fantastical and contradictory ideas with no basis in physical or mental reality.
the value ascribed to objects of subjective desire operates in a comparable manner, albeit with adjustments necessitated by its unique sphere.
aligned with its practical context, this entity exhibits a unique connection to its subject that transcends the abstract nature of theoretical concepts.
this connection manifests as a form of assertion or requirement, where the significance attributed to any entity or event necessitates acknowledgment.
while this requirement is rooted within us as individuals, upon embracing it, we perceive that we are not simply fulfilling a self-imposed mandate or recognizing an attribute of the entity in question.
the latter represents a tangible unity where specific categories have not yet been assigned, while the former embodies an abstract or ideal unity in which the dualism vanishes into a self-subsistent meaning.
this integration parallels how the distinction between the empirical ego and the empirical non-ego dissolves within the comprehensive structure of consciousness, referred to as the ego by fichte.
when the function and its content blend completely, the experience ceases to be subjective because there is no opposing object to define subjectivity.
similarly, the value, which stands on its own and does not rely on external validation, is not purely objective merely because the subject perceives it as independent.
even though it emerges within the subject as a demand for acknowledgment, it retains its essence regardless of whether this recognition is granted.
the metaphysical elevation of value does not influence everyday valuations, which focus solely on values within the individual's awareness and the objectivity that arises as a contrasting object in the psychological valuation process.
it has been previously demonstrated that the formation of values progresses as the gap between the consumer and the source of their pleasure widens.
variances in valuation, categorized as subjective and objective, stem from these distance fluctuations, not based on pleasure where the gap diminishes, but on desire, provoked by the distance and aiming to bridge it.
for items pivotal in the economy, value aligns with demand.
just as the realm of existence represents an individual's perception, the sphere of value embodies their desire.
despite the inherent necessity that every demand anticipates fulfillment through an object, the structure of demand psychologically leans towards the satisfaction itself in most cases.
the actual object tends to become less significant as long as it meets the need.
when a man finds contentment with any woman, consumes any edible item that is digestible, rests at any spot, or attains cultural needs through basic natural resources, his practical consciousness adopts subjectivity entirely.
his focus lies purely on the fulfillment of his own subjective conditions, and his interest in objects is limited to them causing these effects.
this phenomenon becomes apparent in the simple desire for projection by early humans, who prioritize external experiences and consider their inner world as a given.
however, it's important to note that the conscious wish may not always accurately reflect the true value assigned to things.
when a particular need rejects numerous potential fulfillments, often all except one, and it becomes not just satisfaction in general that is sought but satisfaction derived specifically from a particular object, a significant shift occurs from the focus being on the individual to being on the object.
while still concerning the subjective fulfillment of need, in this scenario, the need becomes so distinct that only a specific object can meet it.
here, the object merely triggers sensation and is not inherently valued.
any argument against this notion would negate the distinction, assuming that the need's specificity limits it to one particular satisfying object and precludes satisfaction from any other.
therefore, having discussions is a highly effective method for managing emotions.
when emotions are expressed through words, they are externalized and become a concrete entity separate from the individual, diminishing their intensity.
calming emotions and recognizing the importance of the external world are interconnected aspects of a fundamental process.
redirecting focus from personal needs towards the object itself occurs when the possibility of fulfilling those needs is reduced, making it essential to make the means of satisfaction challenging or elusive.
assuming a highly specific desire focused on particular objects, satisfaction may seem routine as long as no obstacles or challenges are encountered.
the essential aspect to grasp the independent significance of objects lies in the distance between them and our perception.
there are many instances where we need to step back from the objects to create a suitable distance for obtaining an unbiased view of them.
although this perspective is inherently subjective, it plays a critical role when the distance is either too vast or too narrow, emphasizing the importance of subjectivity at these extremes for our cognitive processes.
initially, the object is defined solely by our relation to it, only becoming external and separate from us as it disengages from this initial connection.
the impulse for possessions arises when there is a discrepancy between desire and satisfaction.
to desire items that are currently out of reach, we must first envision them as separate from our current reality, projecting enjoyment onto a future image.
just as children progress from unified perception to distinguishing self from object, the initial uninhibited pleasure in objects transitions into a deeper appreciation and respect as they become more distanced.
this evolution reveals the connection between waning desire, the emergence of valuing objects, and the heightened awareness of self, as the diminishing strength of emotions leads to self-awareness.
the development of the ego is hindered as long as one is consumed by fleeting emotions without reflection.
ego and object are interconnected in all aspects of our lives, initially undistinguished but gradually evolving in relation to one another.
the autonomous worth of objects emerges through comparison with an independent ego.
it is the challenges, obstacles, waiting periods, and efforts involved in pursuing desires that create a divide between the ego and the object.
otherwise, they would remain undeveloped and inseparable in moments of need and fulfillment.
whether an object's definition is shaped by its scarcity or the determination to obtain it, this distancing process allows us to assign a value to the object beyond mere enjoyment.
this contrast is essential in establishing a deeper appreciation for the object.
undoubtedly, iron would lack economic value if obtaining it was as effortless as breathing air.
however, a certain level of difficulty in acquiring iron had to be present to facilitate the production of tools that render iron valuable.
for instance, the idea has been proposed that paintings by an extremely prolific artist might be perceived as less valuable compared to those by a less productive artist of equal talent.
this argument holds only beyond a specific quantitative threshold.
for an artist to attain the renown that inflates the value of their artwork, they must generate a certain volume of pieces.
furthermore, in regions where gold is scarce due to a prevalent paper currency, a scenario exists where common individuals may decline gold even when offered to them.
i aim to demonstrate the universal importance of distance in supposedly unbiased evaluation through an example unrelated to financial values, thereby highlighting a broader principle - aesthetic evaluation.
the appreciation of beauty evolved relatively late as a concept.
despite the immediate sensory pleasure that may still be present today in distinct cases, genuine aesthetic enjoyment involves the ability to value and delight in an object beyond mere sensory or non-sensory gratification.
any cultured individual can inherently differentiate between the aesthetic and sensual appreciation of female beauty, even if they struggle to delineate between these aspects in a specific instance.
in one scenario, we yield to the object, and in the other, the object capitulates to us.
although aesthetic value, similar to other values, is not an inherent aspect of an object but rather a reflection of our emotions, it possesses a distinct quality where this reflection is whole.
essentially, the emotions we project onto an object become integrated with it, presenting itself to us with an independent significance that is intrinsic to the object.
the process by which this objective aesthetic pleasure in things originated historically is intriguing, considering that any primitive enjoyment, which formed the basis for refined appreciation, was initially linked to direct personal satisfaction and usefulness.
one potential explanation lies in a straightforward observation: if an object brings us significant pleasure or benefit, we tend to experience joy each time we encounter it later on, irrespective of its current utility.
this joy, akin to an echo, holds a unique psychological essence shaped by the notion that we no longer seek anything from the object.
it appears that the fundamental aspects of aesthetic delight are hinted at in this passage, yet they could be elucidated further by tracing the shifts in perception from individual psychology to that of the entire species.
while many have tried to link beauty with usefulness, this typically only leads to a crude debasement of beauty.
this could be avoided by situating practicality and immediate sensory gratification further back in the evolutionary history of the species.
this approach could result in an innate, almost automatic pleasure response in our beings towards the appearance of objects; thus, creating a biological-psychological connection that is innate and operates within individuals without their conscious awareness of the object's utility.
there is no necessity to engage in the debate surrounding the inheritance of acquired associations; the only relevant point here is that events unfold as if such traits were hereditary.
as a result, beauty would represent what was once beneficial for the species, and taking pleasure in its contemplation would not involve any practical individual interest.
this concept does not suggest conformity or the standardization of personal preferences; rather, the remnants of past practicality are assimilated into the diverse minds of individuals, evolving into distinct qualities.
this detachment of enjoyment from its original source has now become part of our consciousness, independent of its initial stimulus, and capable of embracing any content permitted by one's mental disposition.
the transformation of objects from being solely utilitarian to having aesthetic value is a process known as objectification.
when an object is deemed beautiful, its quality and significance become more detached from the observer's needs and arrangements compared to when it is merely functional.
utilitarian objects are easily replaceable since they serve similar purposes.
however, aesthetic objects possess a unique individuality, and their value cannot be substituted by another object, even if equally beautiful in its own right.
the concept of aesthetic value stems from the separation between the subjective assessment of an object and our immediate emotional response towards it.
further exploration of this theme is not necessary to acknowledge that the objectification of value arises from this disconnect.
the further removed the usefulness of the object that initially sparked interest and value, only to be forgotten, the greater the pure aesthetic pleasure that comes from the object's form and appearance alone.
when it presents itself with dignity, we ascribe to it a deeper meaning beyond random personal enjoyment.
as a result, we move away from valuing objects solely as tools and instead appreciate their inherent worth.
the need for making sacrifices and understanding that fulfilling desires comes with a cost serves to emphasize the relationship between our current selves and the attainment of our desires.
it heightens our awareness of the distance separating us from what we long for, pushing us towards bridging that gap.
this internal progression, which involves both increasing distance and closeness, is reflected in a historical evolution of differentiation.
as culture evolves, our interests broaden, with the subjects of our fascination moving outward from the center, the self.
this distancing process is balanced by a simultaneous sense of nearness.
the significance placed on objects, individuals, and events located far away by modern society indicates a closeness that surpasses that experienced by primitive societies, where such distant concepts were nonexistent due to the lack of differentiation between proximity and distance.
these contrasting concepts evolve through a reciprocal relationship from an original homogeneous state.
this situation involves mistaking subjectivity for the uniqueness of value.
while my desire to enjoy something is subjective because it lacks awareness or interest in the object itself, a new phase emerges – the process of valuation.
the intentions and emotions associated with the desired object become embodied in the object.
consequently, the object gains a measure of autonomy, either yielding to or resisting the subject, and setting forth conditions for its possession.
these conditions are determined by the subject's initial arbitrary selection within a domain regulated by laws and limitations.
the fact that these forms of objectivity differ among individuals is immaterial in this context.
despite sharing a place in space, time, and quality, the desired object and the represented object hold distinct significances for us.
take the example of love: the individual we love is not merely as our mind perceives them.
i am not discussing the potential distortions emotions might introduce into our understanding of the beloved; such alterations belong to the realm of representation and intellectual concepts, though their essence may be altered.
the beloved person holds significance for us in a manner entirely divergent from intellectual representations.
despite their logical equivalence, they carry a unique meaning for us, akin to the different interpretations a crystallographer and an art critic might give to the marble of the venus de milo.
a singular entity can serve as an object in disparate ways for us: as an object of representation and as an object of desire.
despite the fact that the value of an object is not as objectively measurable as its color or weight, it is not entirely subjective either, like a perception of color influenced by a sensory deception, misinterpretation of an object's quality, or a belief driven by superstition.
the pragmatic interaction with objects generates a distinct form of objectivity, as the actualities of the real world separate an object’s desirability and utility from purely subjective influences, giving rise to the unique concept known as value.
as long as objects remain near the subjects, and as long as the differentiation between demand, scarcity, difficulties, and resistance to acquisition hasn’t yet distanced the objects from the subjects, they are essentially desires and sources of enjoyment, not yet fully evolved into objects of desire and enjoyment.
the transformation into objects occurs when an item, though distant, manages to bridge the gap specifically intended for this purpose.
this process ultimately leads to pure economic objectivity, severing the object from its subjective ties to the subject.
as production aims towards exchanging it with another object playing a reciprocal role, the two objects form a mutual objective relationship.
value, in the context of exchange, transcends strict subjectivity and objectivity, emerging as a supra-subjective and supra-individual concept, without becoming an inherent objective quality of the objects themselves.
it is believed that the divine principle, post the creation of the world's elements, retreated, allowing them to operate by their own capabilities.
this resulted in an objective cosmos governed by its own laws.
moreover, the divine force opted for this autonomy within the cosmic process as the most effective way to achieve its intentions for the world.
similarly, in economic terms, we attribute a certain value to objects, envisioning it as an inherent trait, then set them into the exchange system influenced by these values.
this impersonal exchange leads to a multiplication of values, ultimately enhancing the subjective experience, which was its initial purpose.
this concept forms the basis of valuation seen in economic activities, shaping the essence of money.
let us now delve into exploring these ideas further.
the visibility and tangibility of an object hold significance as they are exchanged for another object.
this mutual exchange results in both objects transcending subjective meaning.
the fundamental connection to human emotions, where valuations naturally occur, is assumed here.
this connection is integrated with the objects, enabling them to participate in a mutual exchange that goes beyond their economic worth and serves as a representation or essence of their value.
in due course, it becomes evident that even within a self-contained economy, the concept of sacrifice remains essential in obtaining goods, as economic individuals are confronted with the natural constraints.
consequently, in such a scenario, the object assumes an objectively conditioned significance, despite the absence of multiple participants in transactions.
while the subject's desires and emotions serve as underlying motivators, they alone are insufficient in establishing the value-form, which results from the comparison of different objects.
through the medium of exchange, all valuations in the economy are conveyed, introducing an intermediary space between individual desires, the driving force of human endeavor, and the fulfillment of needs.
the economy's distinct characteristic as a mode of behavior and communication lies not only in the interchange of values but in the exchanging of values themselves.
nevertheless, the value objects possess in transactions is not entirely detached from their inherent subjective meaning established at the onset.
hence, the subsequent equation showcases one method through which the connection between humanity and the environment can be defined: our actions and beliefs habitually separate individual components from the complete harmony and interplay of objects, where each object mutually supports the others, all possessing equal significance, and organizes these segments into relative entities and wholes.
our association with the entirety of existence is rather vague, involving general feelings; our specific link to the world only materializes when we consistently extract elements from observations in line with our cognitive and practical requirements and confer relative autonomy upon these abstractions, establishing an internal association that objective reality, as an unbroken flow of worldly affairs, lacks.
the economic structure fundamentally relies on abstraction, on the principle of reciprocal exchange, the equilibrium amid giving and receiving; and within its practical evolution, it intricately intertwines with its foundations and outcomes, namely, the impulses and necessities of desire.
the concept of economic life as a form of interaction characterized by the exchange of sacrifices faces criticism regarding the equation of economic value with exchange value.
opponents argue that even if a producer works independently without engaging in buying or selling, they still need to assign value to their products and means of production independently of exchange to establish a proper relationship between costs and output.
however, this argument actually reinforces the initial premise.
assessing whether a product justifies the effort or resources invested mirrors the evaluation of items exchanged for one another.
the notion of exchange is commonly misunderstood as an external relationship separate from the entities it involves.
in reality, it represents a condition or alteration within the related entities, rather than a spatial existence between them like physical objects.
in this manner, an individual working in isolation who gives up something to make specific goods behaves similarly to someone involved in a transaction.
the key distinction is that their counterpart is not another person but the inherent laws of nature and the predictable course of events, which, like another human, demands a sacrifice to fulfill our needs.
the evaluations guiding their decisions are typically very similar to those at play in commercial transactions.
whether this economic actor puts resources or effort into land or transfers them to another party is inconsequential as long as the outcome remains favorable for them.
the essence of this activity remains unchanged by the secondary question of whether the stimulus originates from the natural world or from human nature, or whether it functions within a subsistence or a market-based economy.
the enjoyment of values through attainable objects necessitates sacrificing other values, either through indirectly working for ourselves by working for others or by directly pursuing our own objectives.
this observation underscores that exchange, like production, is also a productive and value-generating process.
in both cases, the aim is to obtain goods by exchanging them for other goods in a way that ultimately results in a surplus of satisfaction compared to the initial state.
while we lack the ability to create matter or energy, our role lies in transferring these resources in a manner that elevates as many as possible from the realm of existence to the realm of values.
despite the perceived influence of the mechanisms and objectivity governing our lives, our actions and thoughts are inherently guided by the values we attribute to objects.
these values, crucial in directing our endeavors, operate within the framework of exchange - ranging from meeting basic needs to pursuing the most profound intellectual and spiritual aspirations, each value attained necessitates the sacrifice of another.
it is challenging to pinpoint a distinct starting point or consequence, as these two elements are intricately intertwined in the fundamental processes shaping practical life.
the unity of practical life remains elusive, and we tend to distinguish it as these two elements.
alternatively, an unending dynamic exists between the two, wherein every exchange relates to a value and vice versa, perpetuating an ongoing cycle.
every process of combining different elements into a whole, known as synthesis, relies on an underlying principle of analysis that it ultimately contradicts.
without this analytical principle, synthesis would not involve a combination of diverse elements but would result in a singular unity.
conversely, every act of breaking down a whole into its components, which is analysis, necessitates a subsequent synthesis that reestablishes interconnectedness to avoid complete disjointedness.
even extreme hostility indicates a stronger connection than mere apathy, with indifference being more robust than total ignorance.
essentially, the opposing force that needs to be overcome through sacrifice often serves as a vital prerequisite for achieving a desired outcome, perhaps even invariably so.
sacrifice should not be viewed as something to be avoided, as shallow thinking and greed might suggest.
sacrifice not only paves the way for specific values but also underpins the very notion of value itself.
in terms of economic behavior, which is our focus here, sacrifice not only represents the cost associated with upholding existing values but also the necessary price for the establishment of new values.
the process of exchange can be understood in two different ways, and i will explore this concept using the example of the value of labor.
when it comes to the desire for leisure, using energy solely for recreation, or avoiding strenuous efforts, labor is indeed viewed as a sacrifice.
on the contrary, there exists a reservoir of untapped work-energy that may be either unutilized or channeled into voluntary labor that is not driven by necessity or moral reasons.
various demands vie for this reservoir of labor power, which, when employed, does not entail sacrifice in itself.
however, not all demands can be met simultaneously.
with every utilization of energy, other potential and desirable uses must be relinquished.
unless we could efficiently allocate energy to carry out both labor a and labor b, sacrificing one for the other, undertaking a specific labor would not involve any sacrifice.
this principle holds for both labor a and labor b, regardless of which one is pursued in place of the other.
when applying this idea to objects, it is presupposed that items should possess a certain length that can be established through comparison.
these precise standards have evolved from countless length comparisons and now serve as the foundation for gauging the length of all physical objects.
these benchmarks represent the abstract notion of length; they appear absolute because everything is gauged against them, without them being subjected to measurement.
this fallacy is akin to thinking that the earth attracts a falling apple without being affected by its attraction.
ultimately, we deceive ourselves about the intrinsic nature of length by overlooking the fact that the complexity of constituent elements, which determines substance, already exists within individual components.
if we were to hypothetically consider the possibility of there being just one line in existence, it would lack a definite length as it would not have any other lines to relate to.
measuring the entire world is not feasible as there is no external reference point to establish its size.
similarly, when viewing a line in isolation without comparisons to other lines or within its own segments, it cannot be labeled as either short or long, existing beyond such categories.
this comparison elucidates the relative nature of economic value rather than refuting it.
when items lack aesthetic or historical significance, their value is solely based on the challenge of obtaining them; they are essentially priced according to their worth, suggesting that their cost aligns with their value.
moreover, moral virtue is evident when conflicting impulses and urges are overcome and forsaken in favor of righteous actions.
an act loses its subjective moral worth if it is effortlessly carried out due to inherent inclinations, regardless of its moral desirability.
moral integrity is achieved through relinquishing alluring yet lesser goods, with the merit increasing in proportion to the temptations resisted and the complexity of the sacrifices made.
we come to appreciate the true worth of what we attain easily and through good fortune when we contrast it with the importance of what is challenging to acquire and requires sacrifices.
while both hold value, the latter is seen through a negative lens but is crucial in establishing the value of the former.
naturally, these instances could be considered exaggerated or extraordinary.
to pinpoint the general essence in the realm of economics, it is crucial initially to differentiate the economic facet as a distinct characteristic or manifestation from the idea of value as an all-encompassing trait of essence.
assuming the existence of value, it logically ensues from the preceding statements that the economic value is not an innate attribute of an item but is determined by the exchange of another item for it.
for instance, wild grain, which may be effortlessly harvested and promptly consumed without any trade, is deemed an economic asset only if its consumption offsets some other expenditure.
however, if all life essentials could be obtained without any sacrifice in a similar manner, there would not be an economic structure, much like in the scenario of birds, fish, or the dwellers of a utopian land.
whether the grain was discovered, stolen, grown, or purchased makes no difference in terms of consumption and its immediate consequences.
as explained previously, the grain does not hold value until it is separated from being a mere direct stimulant and a natural aspect of our emotions tied to the inner experience.
to acquire the specific significance we refer to as value, the object must be dissociated from this context.
value cannot arise solely from desire; it requires encountering obstacles.
if desires were effortlessly fulfilled, economic value exchanges wouldn't have arisen, and desires would not have become so significant.
value is only created when satisfaction is delayed by hindrances, leading to fear of not attaining the object and the effort required to obtain it.
this process combines the various components of desire: fierce pursuit and ongoing acquisition.
even if desire originates solely internally within an individual, the object's value diminishes if it is readily available.
exchange involves more than just the act of giving and receiving; it produces a unique third phenomenon where each component serves as both cause and effect simultaneously.
the renunciation of an object leads to its economic value.
value emerges from the barriers of obstacles, renunciation, and sacrifices that lie between desire and fulfillment.
exchange entails a reciprocal determination of taking and giving, not contingent on an item's pre-assigned value.
all requisite value is established during the exchange itself.
while objects typically acquire value upon entry into an economic system, the discussion here is about the intrinsic, systematic essence of value and exchange.
this essence exists in a basic or ideal sense within historical events, unrelated to their tangible historical evolution, but rather their objective-logical structure.
the shift of the economic value concept from the theoretical realm to essential relationships can be clarified by considering utility and scarcity, commonly seen as fundamental components of value.
the first prerequisite for an economic item to exist is utility, based on the needs of the economic agent.
additionally, scarcity must be included as a second key element for the item to possess a specific value.
if economic values are determined by the interplay of supply and demand, scarcity aligns with supply, and utility aligns with demand.
utility determines if the item is desired and scarcity dictates the price required.
utility represents the inherent aspect of economic values and its level must be recognized for items to participate in economic transactions.
scarcity, on the other hand, is a relative element, reflecting the object's quantity in relation to the total available supply.
initially, demand is not fully realized unless there are obstacles, challenges, and trade-offs separating the desired object and the individual seeking it.
true demand arises when the pursuit of an object involves overcoming hurdles such as patience, forsaking other pursuits, and viewing the desired object within a context of effort and sacrifice.
additionally, the economic worth of a sought-after item, determined by the level of demand for it, can be seen as a refinement or intensification of the relative nature inherent in the desire.
an object's economic value is established within the economy only when its demand is weighed against that of other items; this comparison forms the basis for assessing demand.
the economic value of an object is quantifiable only when there exists a willingness to exchange it for another item, which in turn gives both items a measurable economic value.
the comparative value of two objects can solely be decided by an individual's willingness to trade one for the other, unidirectionally.
in uncomplicated and small-scale practical interactions, assigning a higher or lower value stems from the immediate desire to trade.
claiming that items are exchanged due to their equal worth is merely one instance of a common cognitive inversion, akin to how affection for someone may lead to attributing qualities to them rather than the other way around.
similarly, moral duties often arise from religious beliefs, but it may be that we adhere to these beliefs because the ethical responsibilities deeply resonate with us.
from a conceptual perspective, price aligns with the objective economic value; without a price, it would be challenging to distinguish between objective value and the subjective enjoyment of goods.
contrary to the idea that exchange requires equality of values from the participants' viewpoint, a and b could swap possessions of equivalent value.
however, a would lack motivation to trade if he only received an item of equal worth to what he gave up.
the item he acquires (denoted as b) must hold greater value for him than what he initially owned (referred to as a); likewise, b should benefit more than lose in the exchange.
therefore, if b is more valuable than a for both a and b, any differences objectively nullify each other to an observer.
nonetheless, this equality in values is not realized by the party receiving more than they are giving away in the exchange.
it is crucial to remember that the perceived fair equivalence of value and price, which is considered the standard for practical instances, is applicable only within certain historical and technical contexts.
this equilibrium quickly disintegrates when these circumstances shift.
there exists no universal differentiation, but merely a numerical variance between the standard and the specific cases that are seen as diverging from or adhering to it.
in accordance with this theory, when there is a discrepancy between price and value, one party involved in the trade offers a reduced amount of tangible labor power in exchange for a lesser quantity.
however, this trade is influenced by external factors unrelated to labor power, including the necessity to fulfill immediate needs, personal preferences, deceit, market dominance, and more.
in this broader, subjective context, the equality of the exchanged values is upheld, while the standardized measure of labor power responsible for the disparity is not a result of the transaction itself.
initially, robbery was widely accepted and endorsed as the personal and non-regulated act of seizing what one immediately desired.
even long after homer's time, piracy continued to be seen as a legitimate pursuit in the less developed rural regions of greece, with some primitive societies valuing violent robbery more than honest trade.
this inclination can be comprehended as engaging in trade or payment entails adhering to an external standard, forcing dominant and independent individuals to submit, which can be displeasing.
therefore, this could explain why self-willed aristocrats often look down upon commerce.
conversely, trade promotes harmonious interactions among individuals by establishing a shared and regulated framework, fostering peaceful relations.
according to a conversation i had with a roman antique dealer, the key to a successful transaction lies in finding a middle ground where a seller seeking too high a price and a buyer offering too little can agree.
this illustrates how a fair price can be determined through negotiations between individuals, reflecting a transitional phase from a non-commercial to a commercial economy.
while exchange is rooted in objective value, the process is still subjective, influenced by personal qualities determining the terms and quantities involved.
it is in this context that regulations, traditions, and sacred practices emerged to ensure fair and transparent trade in early societies, bridging the gap between subjectivity and the necessities of exchange that were not yet solely dictated by the intrinsic value of the objects themselves.
during a time when the concept of exchange and value equality between items was still relatively new, reaching a consensus between two individuals making decisions independently proved challenging.
this resulted in the establishment, lasting well into the middle ages, of not only public exchange dealings but also a meticulous regulation of exchange rates for common goods that all parties involved were obliged to follow.
this regulated system's objectivity was considered external and mechanistic, rooted in factors outside the immediate exchange situation.
a truly comprehensive objectivity, however, does not rely on predetermined factors but considers all relevant circumstances in determining exchange value, a notion that was overlooked at the time.
nonetheless, the fundamental aim remains consistent: the transcendent determination of exchange value, which would later be refined through more objective and intrinsic methods.
thus, the imperative for individuals to surpass their own selves in order to acquire a support system and stability that extend beyond personal realms underscores the influence of tradition in legal, intellectual, and moral domains.
this essential uniformity, which surpasses an individual without yet encompassing individuals as a whole, gradually transitions into a standardization grounded in insights into actuality and the embrace of ideal principles.
external factors required for our guidance assume a more readily embraced guise of societal consensus before manifesting as the factual certainty of real-world occurrences and conceptual frameworks.
this trend, reflective of broader cultural evolution, initially hinges on societal dictates until individuals sufficiently grasp external constructs and their intrinsic value to autonomously determine exchange ratios on a case-by-case basis.
this implies that the established prices governing transactions in primitive societies are actually the result of numerous individual exchanges that occurred informally between people before being regulated socially and legally.
this objection is not more valid in this context than in the realms of language, customs, law, and religion – all essential aspects of communal life that have seemingly originated solely from individuals.
from the beginning, these structures have developed as interactions between individuals and the community, rather than being attributed to any one person.
it is plausible that the emergence of socially regulated exchange was not from individual transactions but from a shift in ownership, such as through acts like theft rather than voluntary trade.
in this scenario, interpersonal exchange could be viewed as a means of establishing peace treaties, with both regular and regulated exchanges evolving together.
the intricate connection between relativity and socialization, exemplifying how mankind showcases relativity through tangible means, is depicted here.
society is portrayed as a framework that surpasses individuals but is far from being abstract.
consequently, historical existence avoids being limited to either individuals or broad abstractions.
society stands as a universal entity that breathes life, simultaneously existing in a concrete manner.
this concept offers insight into the profound significance of exchange, acting as the economic-historical embodiment of the relative nature of objects within society.
exchange elevates the particular object and its importance to individuals beyond mere singularity, immersing them in dynamic interactions—a core element of economic value.
regardless of how thoroughly an object's inherent characteristics are examined, economic value, which thrives in the interdependent relationships among various objects based on their nature, remains elusive.
these relationships mutually shape and enhance each other's significance, creating a symbiotic exchange essential for economic value.
even if taken to its logical conclusion, this process would still necessitate a fixed point, an absolute truth.
the act of cognition itself, which facilitates this dissolution, appears to transcend the continuous flux of change and the relative nature of its content.
breaking down the absolute objectivity of the object being cognized into modes of understanding that are only relevant to the human mind implies the existence of an ultimate reference point that cannot be derived from anything else.
the variability and relativity of mental processes do not impact these foundational assumptions and standards that govern our determination of the nature of our perceptions.
the proposed reduction of all objectively true knowledge to merely psychological origins hinges on certain principles that possess significance beyond the realm of psychology to avoid circular reasoning.
this concept is not only crucial for the foundational framework of the ensuing discussion but also serves as a template for numerous specific aspects and warrants further examination.
acknowledging that there might be an inherent absolute norm or self-justifying authority governing our knowledge, while understanding that the content of this knowledge evolves continuously due to advancements and that each achieved understanding paves the way for a deeper and more suitable one, does not amount to skepticism.
similarly, recognizing that natural occurrences adhere to universal laws that require constant adjustments with expanding knowledge, and that these laws are always influenced by historical contexts, leading them to lack the absolute quality often associated with the concept, is not skeptical either.
furthermore, the foundational principles of a perfected understanding cannot be viewed as solely conditioned or subjectively true, but rather each assumption available at any given time must be treated as such.
despite not being legally established, this right is considered law once it comes into being.
however, it does not possess the same authority as rights grounded in the law.
in reality, any entity that introduces such a non-legally binding right aims to validate it or create the illusion of legitimacy, paying tribute to an absolute right that transcends relativity and remains unaltered by it.
this absolute right is represented to us through the process of deriving all current legal principles from preceding ones.
this mutual validation of truth within cognition through reciprocity is further supported by another aspect of relativity, which involves the interplay between our theoretical and practical life interests.
it is firmly believed that all perceptions of reality are influenced by our unique physical and mental makeup, rather than mechanically reflecting the external world.
the diverse perspectives of various beings, such as insects with their compound eyes, eagles with their remarkably sharp vision, olms with their vestigial eyes, and humans alongside countless other species, are inherently distinct from each other.
consequently, none of these viewpoints perfectly mirrors the external reality.
despite their inherent differences, these perspectives serve as the foundation and guidance for our practical endeavors, enabling us to engage with the world in a manner that acknowledges its existence independently of our subjective interpretations.
after establishing the effectiveness of various modes of representation through careful selection and development, they collectively form a theoretical domain that internally dictates the inclusion or exclusion of new representations.
similar to the way geometric rules are interdependent based on strict inner principles, the axioms and methodological norms that underpin this entire framework cannot themselves be geometrically proven.
the system of geometry as a whole does not hold validity in the same manner as individual propositions within it.
while the individual statements can be proven by one another, the system's validity hinges on external factors such as the nature of space, our perceptual abilities, and the robustness of our cognitive processes.
looking at the same issue from a different perspective, relativism concerning perception principles can be described as follows: the fixed principles that purport to definitively represent object essences are transformed into guiding principles that serve merely as viewpoints in the advancement of knowledge.
the ultimate, most profound abstractions, simplifications, and conclusions of thought must relinquish the authoritative claim of being the final judgments in the realm of knowledge.
the idea that things act in a certain manner needs to be substituted, within the framework of the most advanced and comprehensive perspectives, with the concept that our comprehension must proceed as though things behave in specific ways.
this approach effectively articulates how our understanding functions in reality and its relationship to the world.
the complexity of our existence and the limitations of any one-dimensional conceptual expression regarding our relationship with things consistently give rise to the fact that no such expression can truly suffice.
historically, such expressions have often been counterbalanced by opposing viewpoints, leading to uncertainty, conflicting ideas, or a reluctance to embrace overarching principles.
by transforming definitive assertions about the nature of things into heuristic statements focused on guiding our approach to knowledge and defining ideal objectives, it becomes feasible for conflicting principles to coexist harmoniously.
when viewed purely as methodological tools, these assertions can be interchangeably employed without contradiction, allowing for a seamless transition between inductive and deductive methods.
the genuine convergence of understanding is achieved through dismantling rigid dogma in favor of a dynamic and evolving process.
ultimately, the fundamental principles manifest not in absolute exclusion but in mutual interdependence, reciprocal invocation, and complementary interplay.
the form of the interdependence of thought processes is where all general and specific systems of knowledge converge.
understanding the political, social, religious, or cultural aspects of the present necessitates a grasp of history, as that is the only route to such comprehension.
the pieces of the past that reach us are fragmented, conveyed through various sources of varying reliability.
to truly breathe life into and interpret this past, it can only be achieved through the immediate experiences of the present.
despite the transformations and changes required, the present, being the key to the past, can solely be comprehended through the past.
conversely, the past, vital for understanding the present, is only accessible through the perceptions and sensitivities of the present.
all historical representations stem from the interplay of these interpretative elements, with none allowing the others to settle in isolation.
the essence of complete understanding extends infinitely, as each element within one set relies on the other for interpretation.
this concept can be applied to the realm of psychology as well.
when interacting with individuals, we perceive them merely as automated entities generating sounds and gestures for us to observe.
it is through comparison with our own mental processes, the only ones we have direct knowledge of, that we deduce the existence of a mind within them and attempt to grasp its inner workings.
paradoxically, our self-awareness flourishes through understanding others, and the division of the self into an observed and an observing entity is realized through reflections on the relationships between oneself and others.
therefore, the journey to comprehend our own mental states involves a reciprocal exchange between self-examination and observations of external beings, which we interpret based on our self-awareness.
in essence, the exploration of mental phenomena is a dynamic interplay between the self and others.
when strictly conceptualized, these two genetic possibilities create a troubling contradiction.
however, if viewed as heuristic principles that exist in a relationship of alternation and interaction, this contradiction can be avoided.
there is no impediment to attempting to link any current state of the world to the mental conditions that have led to its representation.
similarly, there is no obstacle to tracing these conditions back to cosmic, historical, or social factors that could have given rise to a mind possessing these abilities and forms.
the depiction of these external facts may, in turn, be rooted in the subjective assumptions of scientific and historical knowledge, which are derived from the objective circumstances of their inception, leading to an endless cycle.
truth is defined as the interconnection between representations, which can manifest as an infinite construction.
our knowledge might be built upon absolute truths, yet it remains uncertain if we have attained the ultimate stage or if we are progressing towards a more comprehensive understanding.
this idea of truth can also be seen as a reciprocal relation within representation systems, with its demonstration being reciprocal too.
these two thinking processes are linked by a unique division of functions.
it is essential to view our cognitive existence through two complementary categories: its content and the process that, as a conscious event, conveys or realizes this content.
these categories have vastly different structures.
the mental process should be perceived as a continuous flow without distinct breaks, where one mental state seamlessly transitions into the next, similar to organic growth.
at times, within a complex system, any representation could be subject to scrutiny, even those representing the majority view.
the vast disparity in quantity between questionable and established representations further obscures the interdependent relationship.
this imbalance has historically led to a focus on the earth's gravitational pull on the apple rather than vice versa, perpetuating the perception of weight as an inherent property of a body due to one-sided observations.
consequently, truth is sometimes misconstrued as an intrinsic quality of individual representations, overlooking the intricate web of relationships in which truth is embedded, all against the backdrop of numerous representations that are currently not under scrutiny.
heuristics, seen as an application of the relativistic principle to knowledge categories, can acknowledge itself as a heuristic principle without contradiction.
in relativism, the question of the foundation of this principle, which is not inherent in the principle itself, poses no challenge because the foundation is extended infinitely.
relativism aims to transform every apparent absolute into a relation and takes the same approach with any absolute serving as the basis for a new relation.
this ongoing heuristic process eradicates the need to either reject or fully embrace the absolute concept.
the concept can be understood in two ways: one being that an absolute exists but can only be comprehended through an endless process, or that only relations exist but can only supplant the absolute within an infinite process.
relativism is willing to entertain the notion that the mind can transcend its own boundaries.
this can serve as a reference to a philosophical perspective that enables a comprehensive interpretation that harmonizes the diverse aspects of things, offering a broad framework for understanding economic value.
given that the fundamental trait of all observable existence is the interconnectedness and interplay among all elements, which directly relates to economic worth and imparts this life principle onto economic substance, the true essence of money can now be understood.
as the value of things, viewed through their economic interconnections, finds its most refined form in money, serving as the ultimate expression and concrete representation of this concept.
in the following chapter, we will explore whether the intrinsic link between money and nonmonetary value can be dismantled.
countless mistakes have occurred due to the failure to differentiate conceptually between the core essence and significance of money and the characteristics of the values which money enhanced by emphasizing a specific quality.
initially, we will analyze money independently of the material that physically represents it; as the attributes that the material contributes to money cause it to be classified under the goods that are transacted with it.
it is evident that money represents one aspect, while the entirety of goods acquired through money embodies the opposing side; strictly in terms of its fundamental nature, it should be construed purely as money, detached from the secondary attributes connecting it to the contrasting side.
the location of a body is not an inherent characteristic of the body itself, but rather a connection to other bodies; and during any shift in position, these others, along with the body itself, can be seen as either the active or passive entity.
similarly, as the worth of a is determined by its association with the economic environment, it would be equally valid and only slightly less practical to view any alteration in the value of a as a variation in b, c, d, and e.
this notion of relativity, as seen in practices like bartering, becomes solidified in currency as the representation of value.
further examination on how this occurs will be done later.
declaring that the value of a is 1 mark has stripped a of everything non-economic, meaning it lacks any exchange relationship with b, c, d, and e.
this mark, when seen as value, is the isolated function of a concerning the other objects within the economy.
money serves as the standard for measuring and facilitating the exchange of valuable items.
its function depends on having a valuable representation initially, which in turn attributes value to this representation.
therefore, money is categorized along with these objects and is subject to the standards that originate from it.
the value that is ultimately assessed is not money itself, which is merely a representation of value, but rather the objects being exchanged; fluctuations in prices indicate shifts in their relationships with one another.
money, when considered in its fundamental role, does not alter its own value; however, a greater or lesser quantity of money reflects a change, abstracted from its representations and assuming an independent form of expression.
this characteristic of money is essentially its lack of inherent qualities and individuality.
as an intermediary between individual objects and in an impartial relationship with each, money must remain entirely neutral.
in this context, money epitomizes the pinnacle of advancement in an ongoing progression; this sequence is logically intricate yet holds immense importance for our worldview, where each element, while adhering to the series' formula and reflecting its internal dynamics, simultaneously deviates as a supplementing, regulating, or counteractive force.
the series commences with invaluable values that can be easily overlooked when compared to material possessions.
while many of our belongings can be replaced in some way, ensuring the overall value of our lives remains consistent even if we exchange one item for another, there are exceptions.
happiness can be sustained by various means, but some objects are irreplaceable not only because they offer a unique level of joy, but also because their value is deeply rooted in the specific object itself rather than in the happiness it brings, which can be found in other possessions as well.
there are two fundamental poles that define the spectrum of values.
on one end lies the absolute individual value, unique in its significance and irreplaceable in our value system.
on the other end, we find the easily interchangeable.
between these extremes, objects are positioned based on their degree of replaceability, determined by how easily they can be substituted and the range of alternatives available.
this concept can be further understood by distinguishing between the irreplaceable and replaceable aspects within each object.
while many items exhibit elements of both qualities, we are often misled by the fluidity of transactions and by our own biases.
even objects that seem easily replaceable or purchasable reveal intrinsic qualities that cannot be entirely substituted by material possessions upon closer inspection.
money serves as a vital means to offset the disparities inherent in any barter system and address the void created by the absence of the consumed object.
its efficacy in this role is derived from its unique standing both within and outside the economic framework.
were money a tangible commodity, it would struggle to equitably represent and interconnect diverse items.
its function in facilitating economic transactions is rooted in its tangible embodiment of the relationships between various economic values, enabling it to seamlessly integrate into the economic continuum.
the significance of money becomes apparent through its empirical demonstration as stability of value, derived from its interchangeable nature and absence of specific qualities.
this attribute is widely recognized as one of the most vital and practical features of money.
the duration of economic activities, crucial for the economy's continuity, integration, and productivity, relies on the stability of money's value.
without this stability, long-term planning, large-scale ventures, and extended credits would be infeasible.
monitoring fluctuations in the price of a single item alone is insufficient to determine whether the item's value changes while the value of money remains constant, or vice versa.
the stability of money's value is only established as an objective reality when price reductions in one commodity or group of commodities are counterbalanced by price escalations elsewhere.
a general increase in prices signifies a decline in the value of money, disrupting the stability of its value.
as long as objects are compared or traded with each other directly, their subjective and economic qualities, their absolute and relative importance, remain undistinguished.
they cannot function as money when money loses its practical utility.
money evolves into a symbol of economic value as economic value essentially involves the exchangeable nature of objects.
gradually, this relative aspect takes precedence over other qualities of objects that become money, reducing them to mere representations of relativity.
exchangeability is fundamental for economic values as it establishes their objective interconnection.
by enabling what is to be exchanged to come together despite any differences, it bridges the gap between them.
money has given exchangeability not only a flawless mechanism but also a tangible presence, encompassing all its diverse facets.
money holds profound philosophical significance as it epitomizes, within the realm of practicality, the fundamental concept that all things derive their essence and significance through interconnection and interdependence.
in essence, it symbolizes the intrinsic relationship among various elements shaping our existence.
objects like a wedding ring or official uniform are tangible representations of deeper, often moral, legal, or political connections between individuals.
moreover, items like letters or pledges symbolize the complex bond between man and transcendent entities like god, embodying this relationship in a tangible form.
telegraph wires linking different countries, just like military weapons that signify potential discord, serve as conduits that hold little individual significance but gain relevance in the interactions and dynamics between people and human collectives they facilitate.
the depiction of these relations and connections may be seen as abstract, as only the elements with mutually established conditions embodied in specific concepts are deemed tangible.
the resolution of this dualism, merging substantial elements into interactions and processes, is a task reserved for metaphysical inquiry transcending empirical constraints.
however, pragmatic awareness has devised a model that harmonizes the relational processes underlying reality with substantive existence, forming the essential structure for practical abstract relations to manifest.
money is the ultimate manifestation of symbolic construction, representing pure interaction at its core.
it elucidates the most abstract concepts and transcends individual identities.
signifying the connection between humanity and the wider world, money encapsulates the interplay of singular instances that collectively form reality.
even if the value relativity of economic objects were not an original factor but a culmination of progress, money's significance would endure.
our understanding of phenomena often stems not from the phenomena directly, but from a refined and advanced form.
the essence of language cannot be deduced solely from the initial speech attempts of a child.
when delineating animal existence, it is not surprising to find that it is incompletely manifested during the evolutionary shift from plant life.
likewise, insight into the significance of simpler mental processes can at times be unraveled through the examination of higher mental faculties, even if direct connections might not be readily discernible.
the abstract idea of a sequence of events frequently remains theoretical and is seldom achieved in its entirety; nonetheless, striving towards this ideal facilitates a meaningful comprehension of the concept.
money, in its essence, has reached a pinnacle where it solely embodies the concept of exchangeability in its purest form.
it represents the defining feature that renders items economically valuable, rather than encompassing their complete essence.
however, money itself encapsulates the entire concept of monetary value.
in the upcoming chapter, i will analyze to what extent various historical forms of money embody this idea and whether the practical use of money tends to gravitate towards a different perspective.
the discourse on the essence of money raises the fundamental query of whether money should be considered a value itself to perform its functions of measurement, exchange, and representation of values, or if it suffices for money to be merely a token or symbol devoid of intrinsic worth, akin to an accounting figure representing value rather than embodying it.
the detailed technical and historical examination of this debate, delving into core aspects of monetary and value theory, would be unnecessary if resolution could be achieved through a commonly mentioned logical contention.
this argument suggests that a measuring tool must possess the same attributes as the object being measured: a length measure needs to be long, a weight measure heavy, and a space measure should encompass dimensions.
hence, according to this perspective, a value gauge must possess value itself.
i will present an alternative argument that leads to different outcomes.
in the provided scenario, we can indeed compare the strength of the wind causing a tree branch to break with that of a human hand achieving the same result, but only in terms of quantifiable force.
additionally, we can gauge the wind's force by assessing the thickness of the broken branch.
while acknowledging that the broken branch may not directly reflect the wind's energy as the hand's effort does, we can determine the relative force of two wind gusts by comparing their ability to damage branches.
an illustrative example supports this perspective convincingly.
the most diverse entities we are familiar with, the two contrasting aspects of the world view that neither metaphysics nor science has been able to reconcile, are the movements of physical matter and the mental states of consciousness.
the sheer physicality of the former and the intrinsic subjectivity of the latter have not allowed for any evident common ground to be established.
nevertheless, a physiological psychologist is able to gauge the variations in the intensity of conscious perceptions through alterations in external movements that affect our sensory organs.
as there exists a consistent quantitative relationship between these two elements, the magnitude of one determines the proportional magnitude of the other, without necessitating any intrinsic connection or sameness between them.
this challenges the logical principle that implied the ability of currency to quantify value was contingent upon its own worth.
the objects m and n can have a relationship that is not based on qualitative identity, making them unable to directly measure each other.
this relationship could involve cause and effect, symbolism, a shared connection to a third factor, or other possibilities.
assuming that object a is a quarter of m and object b is a fractional part of n, if a relationship similar to m and n exists between a and b, then b would be equivalent to a quarter of n.
despite the qualitative distinction and the challenge of directly comparing a and b, it remains possible to ascertain the quantity of one object based on the quantity of the other.
for example, although a specific amount of food does not represent the exact same thing as a strong desire for food that it could potentially fulfill, when there is ample food to meet half of the need, i can calculate that the quantity of food on hand is equal to half of the requirement.
in such cases, having a general connection is enough to gauge the amounts of its components.
by viewing the measurement of items through money in a similar manner, the notion of their direct exchangeability and the logical necessity for money to inherently hold value seem unsupported.
the same fundamental approach is observed among a tribal community in laos, who sustain themselves through trade.
their currency is the iron hoe, but they also mine and trade gold to neighboring tribes, using it as their sole item for trade.
interestingly, when weighing gold, they employ corn as their only measure, exchanging one corn measure of gold for one hoe.
this simplistic "one against one" arrangement symbolizes an equivalence between these distinct forms of exchange.
in this context, a single commodity in barter signifies the value of all goods, akin to how a single unit of currency portrays the entire wealth.
consequently, it is inferred that the relationship between individual units symbolically reflects a connection between the totalities at play.
if the foundational aspect that forms the basis of the relationship were to be overlooked, functioning practically but not consciously, it would uncover a deep-seated aspect of human behavior.
human consciousness has a limited capacity for receptivity, strategically selecting only a fraction of the numerous qualities and dimensions of a subject that piques our interest.
various viewpoints shape the process of choosing and organizing the factors that draw our attention, forming a systematic sequence.
this sequence initiates with a series of occurrences where only the shared fundamental elements are considered.
on the opposite end of the spectrum, our consciousness is tuned into the distinct characteristics of each occurrence, perceiving their absolute uniqueness, while the general foundational elements remain subconscious.
between these extremes, certain specific points or facets of the complete occurrence receive the utmost focus at different levels.
the unique traits of each family member contribute significantly to the overall character and atmosphere of the family unit.
this environment, albeit often unnoticed, plays a crucial role in shaping the individual qualities in distinct manners.
this holds true for larger groups as well.
while relationships among individuals are influenced by each person's specific input, they also adhere to certain universal human dynamics and circumstances that serve as the foundation, with individual variances acting as modifiers.
this principle can also be applied to the psychological dynamics concerning financial transactions and pricing.
the relationship between the value of a commodity and the value of a set amount of money is not a mere equality but a proportion, representing a ratio between two fractions.
in a specific economic context, one fraction consists of the total value of all commodities, while the other is the total quantity of money.
the establishment of this relationship is based on the assumption that, for practical purposes, these two totals are considered equal; in other words, the practical circumstances of dealing with both categories lead to the perception of equality in our theoretical understanding.
this fundamental principle underlies all connections between particular commodities and their prices, operating unconsciously and enabling individual instances – which are of interest and thus come to our conscious attention – to establish a connection.
we must now focus on the specific qualifications regarding the concept of the total amount of money.
the reason why it cannot be stated that there is an equal amount of money available for spending as there are commodities for sale is due to the vast quantitative difference between all available commodities and all available money.
there is no direct comparison of quantity between the two because there is no common measure for them like there would be for objects with identical qualities.
no specific quantity of money corresponds to a specific quantity of commodities, as the functions of money could, theoretically, be fulfilled with a significantly reduced amount of money.
the feasibility of this in practice, without halting transactions, is illustrated by the following factual example.
from this perspective, it can be argued that there is significantly less money available compared to commodities.
the ratio between a single commodity and its price is notably smaller than the overall ratio between all goods and all money.
nevertheless, there are two ways to uphold our fundamental assertion.
firstly, we could define the total volume of commodities as the ones currently in the process of being sold.
drawing on an aristotelian notion: an unsold commodity is essentially a potential item for sale, transitioning into an actual commodity only upon sale.
similar to how money only becomes truly functional when making a purchase, a commodity is truly a commodity only upon sale; prior to that, it remains merely a potential product for sale, an abstract prospect.
individuals do not base their spending and decisions on prices solely on their current disposable income, but rather in consideration of their total income over an extended time frame.
in this context, the ratio of money to commodities can be balanced out as the denominator of the fraction doesn't just represent the physical money on hand but is a multiple of it influenced by the circulation of money within a specific period.
this perspective helps resolve the conflict between the available stock of commodities and those that serve as equivalents to money.
it also supports the notion that there should be no fundamental disparity between the total value of commodities and the amount of money within a self-sustained economic system.
despite disagreements over the relationship between a specific commodity and its price, as well as the potential fluctuations and discrepancies that can arise when certain fractions have been psychologically established while others may be more appropriate due to objective changes, and temporary shortages in the means of exchange caused by a rapid rise in transaction volume, it remains true that imports and exports of metal in response to money shortages or surpluses compared to commodity values within a country are merely adjustments within a broader economic context where individual countries function as provinces.
these trade movements signify the restoration of a proper relationship between two provinces after one of them has undergone changes.
the relationship between totalities holds a certain axiom-like significance, distinct from statements derived from it.
while the latter can be proven, the axiom itself lacks a logical derivation.
this sets a crucial methodological rule, demonstrated in a different value category.
pessimism's fundamental premise asserts an overwhelming prevalence of suffering over happiness in life.
according to this view, living beings collectively endure more pain than pleasure.
such a claim hinges on the assumption that pleasure and pain can be directly equated as opposing but equal magnitudes.
in reality, the lack of a common measure makes it impossible to determine the exact balance between them.
when we undergo suffering, it is unfeasible to gauge the amount of pleasure needed to offset that suffering.
the previous discussion did not delve into the actual value of money.
its purpose was to demonstrate that while money serves to measure values, it does not inherently possess value itself.
however, the prospect that money may indeed have value is pivotal in comprehending not just the historical progression of money but primarily its intrinsic essence.
in early economic stages, items like cattle, salt, slaves, tobacco, and hides functioned as money because of their use-value.
regardless of its evolutionary path, at its inception, money must have been regarded as valuable.
the ability to exchange intangible forms for tangible goods becomes plausible when there is a robust and credible network supporting it, assuring us that seemingly valueless assets can facilitate the acquisition of other values.
currently, money is no longer considered valuable primarily for its material worth, but rather as an essential and indispensable asset.
europeans no longer view coins as precious due to their potential to be transformed into jewelry.
the contemporary value of money does not stem from its metal content, as the abundance of precious metals makes them more suitable for adornment and technical functions rather than as the basis for monetary value.
following the theory on the value of money as a metal to its logical conclusion would lead to an excess of precious metal objects, diminishing their worth.
money's worth based on its convertibility into other goods only holds true when such exchanges occur, albeit infrequently.
throughout its developmental stages, it was apparent that...
the utility of money surpasses its material worth when it is involved in a wide range of services and circulates quickly.
in contemporary trade, there is a growing inclination to diminish the physical representation of money as a store of value.
this shift is inevitable since, even with the maximal production of precious metals, using cash for all transactions would be insufficient.
examples like clearinghouses and international bills of exchange illustrate this overall tendency, which will be further explored in the concluding part of this chapter.
through examining the material and stylistic characteristics of each piece of art, a standard emerges that the actual work strives to adhere to with varying degrees of accuracy.
this connection allows for the comparison of even the most diverse artworks.
the potential compliance of these standards forms an aesthetic system, a defined structure, and an overall uniformity in terms of value, starting from the initially varied individual works.
this concept extends beyond the realm of art.
from our separate assessments, a hierarchy of importance takes shape.
discrepancies are perceived when seeking a unified structure and an intrinsic connection between values.
our ability to perceive the world in this particular way stems from our capacity to not only balance two objects but also compare their relationships to two others, thus uniting them through assessments of equality or similarity.
money, as a manifestation of this inherent cognitive ability, serves as an extreme yet pure illustration of it.
money communicates the value dynamic between items exchanged by establishing an equivalence between a specific amount and a general standard, mirroring the link between a particular commodity and the entirety of commodities accessible for trade.
money is not inherently valuable in itself, with its components holding the same relative proportions as other values to each other or the whole.
its essence lies in articulating the value connections between different entities.
it has become evident that the physical presence of money is becoming less necessary for the growth of production and wealth.
while large amounts of money are pursued for specific functional purposes rather than for their own sake, these objectives can be achieved through processes that do not necessarily involve physical money, as seen in international trade.
the importance of money in representing the value of goods is independent of any inherent value, as discussed earlier.
just as the material of a measuring scale for space has no bearing on its function, with only the relations of its parts being significant, the substance of money is irrelevant in providing a scale for determining values.
the fundamental importance of money as a measure and representation of the value of goods has remained constant, yet its role as an intermediary for storing and moving values has evolved and is still evolving.
money has transitioned from a tangible and direct form where it initially performed these functions to an abstract form; now, it primarily operates as an idea reflected in a symbolic representation.
the emergence of money appears to be intertwined with a significant cultural shift.
various cultural levels can be distinguished based on their direct engagement with pertinent objects and their use of symbols.
differences become apparent in the way of life based on whether religious fulfilment comes from symbolic rites versus direct personal connection with the divine; whether societal respect is demonstrated through formal protocols dictating social hierarchies or through informal displays of politeness, affection, and regard; whether transactions and agreements are informal communication or formalized and validated through symbolic acts of commitment; and whether academic pursuits engage directly with empirical reality or with abstract concepts and symbolic representations.
while these distinctions are fluid, human history reflects a constant fluctuation between these approaches.
recently, there has been a noticeable disconnection developing once again.
the artistic movement of naturalism has shed light on the importance of separating perception from mere symbols used for artistic representation.
it underscores the difference between representing something indecent artistically versus showcasing actual indecency.
it is crucial to differentiate between perceiving reality and the symbolic realm within art, particularly within the realm of naturalism.
this distinction has fostered a newfound openness among the educated population when discussing sensitive topics.
when approached objectively and with modesty as a basis, formerly taboo subjects are now more acceptable.
the stigma associated with discussing delicate matters seems to be shifting more towards the subject itself, rather than the symbolic representation of it.
this, in turn, influences the dynamic between reality and symbolism in both specific and broader contexts.
each party compromises based on their perception of the relative strengths involved, stopping short of what would lead to an actual strike.
this prevents the need for conflict by using innovative approaches to predict and manage potential outcomes.
if accurate assessments of strength could always be made through imagination, conflicts could be prevented.
the utopian idea of determining the result of wars through a chess match between generals is unrealistic, as the outcome of chess doesn't necessarily reflect the outcome of a real battle.
alternatively, a war simulation involving all military elements and strategic variables could potentially substitute physical warfare if executed effectively.
the transition from tangible forms of money to a more abstract concept initiates when certain natural products - serving as both export commodities and mediums of exchange - take on a currency role: for instance, tobacco in virginia, rice in carolina, cod in newfoundland, tea in china, and furs in massachusetts.
when these items are used for export, their value is perceived differently from the immediate value in domestic trade.
a practical compromise between abstract currency and tangible value is found in jewelry money, namely gold and silver, which strikes a balance being neither as arbitrary as the former nor as rudimentary as the latter.
gold and silver serve as ideal mediums for money to symbolize value effectively.
this transformation into physical form is crucial for money to have its most significant impact, and it is unlikely that this concept will be phased out in the foreseeable future.
it is evident that even the most practical item needs to forfeit its utility to serve as currency.
for instance, in abyssinia, carefully cut pieces of rock salt are circulated as coins, their value stemming from not being utilized as salt.
along the coast of somaliland, strips of blue cotton cloth, each measuring two ells in length, were once used as currency, marking an advancement from randomly cut cloth currency and showing a move away from using cloth conventionally.
the potential technical and aesthetic applications of gold and silver remain unrealized when they are in circulation as currency, as is the case with all forms of money.
to function as currency, any material's various everyday uses must be set aside.
once materials demonstrate practical, aesthetic, or other values, they are withdrawn from circulation and are no longer treated as money.
all other values can be compared and exchanged based on their utility to acquire a specific worth, excluding money from this process.
if money is utilized in the same way as the value it represents, it loses its status as currency.
the unique feature of precious metals as monetary material allows easy conversion from one form to money.
however, at any time, they can serve as money or as jewelry, offering the flexibility of functioning as currency or for practical use.
this suggests that money can then be linked back to other types of value.
for instance, when purchasing wood for fuel, its value lies solely in its heat-producing ability rather than any other potential use.
however, the actual scenario differs significantly.
if it is argued that the worth of money lies in the value of its material, it implies that its value is embedded in the attributes or capabilities of the substance which are not specifically related to money.
this seeming contradiction hints that money doesn't necessarily need to be backed by materials that possess inherent value or worth in other aspects.
it suffices if any substance can assume the role of money, regardless of its other qualities.
it needs to be investigated whether discarding all value-related functions supporting the notion that money must have intrinsic value validates the assertion that money is simply money and nothing more.
upon the restoration of freedom and autonomy following interference and external control over our actions, a distinct sense of contentment and significance accompanies our deeds.
this feeling does not stem from the outcomes or nature of what we do but solely from the removal of external influence.
the same actions, when performed after a sequence of self-directed choices, would lack the appeal that arises from breaking free from a prior form of restriction.
moreover, the value of what is given to others often depends on what is retained or deliberately held back.
a warm and welcoming attitude, especially towards those of lower status, loses its impact if it lacks a sense of moderation and restraint.
it becomes more meaningful to the recipient when they sense that the giver is sharing a part of themselves while still maintaining some level of reserve.
this principle also applies to the importance of our own actions and endeavors.
unforeseen and urgent demands can reveal untapped abilities and strengths within us for tasks that once seemed distant, showcasing dormant potentialities that only emerge in times of crisis.
this underscores the idea that, apart from the energies we actively utilize, there are latent capabilities in everyone, suggesting that each individual could have evolved into something different from their current state.
in life, only a select few of the numerous possible paths can be actualized.
as a result, the choices that are made become increasingly significant and valuable as we come to realize that they are chosen from a plethora of options, with many other potential pursuits left unexplored or sacrificed in favor of the selected ones.
the decision to prioritize certain accomplishments over others condenses a broader spectrum of life’s energies into the chosen paths, imbuing them with depth, uniqueness, and concentrated strength.
this selective process lends a distinct and refined quality to the chosen pursuits, elevating them to embody the essence of our overall character.
by forgoing the development of alternative energies, the chosen paths assume a profound and representative role in our lives, extending beyond their immediate scope to symbolize our collective identity.
the concept of money as having value solely based on its function is the foundation of the argument presented.
it implies that money only holds value as a medium of exchange and not intrinsically.
if money held value beyond its role as currency, those in power would desire it for more than just its monetary function.
the absence of this inherent value does not require further proof.
while this argument has logical flaws, it highlights the specific value that money holds, mainly as a medium of exchange.
money gains its value from being a tool for transactions; without anything to trade, money becomes worthless.
its role in storing and moving value is secondary to its function as a medium of exchange, which is essential for its other roles to be relevant.
plato's dissatisfaction with the limitations of our worldly experiences led him to imagine a metaphysical realm of ideas beyond space and time where the true, harmonious, and absolute essence of things exists.
as a result, earthly reality seemed devoid of genuine substance and importance.
however, this realm of ideas still cast a reflection back onto the earthly realm, imbuing it with significance akin to a dim shadow of the absolute realm.
this interplay between the two realms also holds true in the domain of values.
the concrete reality perceived by the mind lacks inherent values, as previously stated.
it evolves without regard for values, often undermining noble aspects while preserving the base ones, due to its lack of a hierarchical structure based on worth or interests.
the evolution of money represents a continuous pursuit of the perfect symbol of economic worth, a standard never completely achieved.
initially, money was considered alongside other items of value, its tangible material worth compared to them.
over time, with the increasing demand for mediums of exchange and benchmarks of worth, money transitioned from merely linking value equations to symbolizing them, gradually gaining autonomy from its material value.
however, money still retains a residue of material worth due not to inherent factors, but due to certain flaws in economic practices, specifically concerning its role as a medium of exchange.
the shift from the intrinsic value to the symbolic significance of money is facilitated by various factors previously discussed.
even in the second scenario, the aesthetic value of the jewelry is not diminished by the use of a small quantity of precious metal.
even if this usage is extreme to the extent that the metal holds very little value, it is important that it remains a precious material in order to enhance the decorative and aesthetic appeal.
the actual worth of the material is not the focus; rather, what matters is that only a very valuable material can adequately uphold a perfect formal relationship between the components.
it is apparent that attributing material value to money as a complimentary and supportive principle in uncertain economic relations is an interpretation of processes occurring in the subconscious minds of economic actors.
economic interactions are carried out so efficiently, with a sophisticated alignment of numerous intricate details, that one might think they were orchestrated by a superior mind of extraordinary wisdom if not for the instinctive adaptability of the human species.
the conscious intentions and foresight of individuals alone cannot uphold the harmony seen in economic activities, despite the dissonance and imperfections.
it is necessary to consider the accumulation of unconscious experiences and calculations over the course of economic history that guide its trajectory.
while acknowledging that unconscious concepts do not offer a definitive explanation, they serve as tools for comprehension rooted in a misconception.
the allure of issuing new money often proves too strong to resist, leading to a cycle of repeating the process.
this serves as just one illustration of the many well-debated failures associated with arbitrary paper money issuance, which becomes a temptation whenever money is not tied closely to a substance of limited availability.
an example highlighting this is the suggestion made by a french statesman in the sixteenth century.
he proposed switching from using silver to using iron for coinage, due to concerns about the oversupply of silver from america eroding its value.
the proposal aimed to ensure a controlled money supply by utilizing a metal that only gains value through official minting, thus preventing a situation where every silver owner automatically possesses money, potentially leading to an unlimited money supply.
this unique proposition demonstrates a clear grasp of the idea that while a precious metal may not be inherently suitable as currency, it serves a vital role in imposing a necessary restriction on the money supply.
should a metal fail in this regard, it must be substituted by another substance that can be more effectively regulated.
the preference for metal as a medium of exchange stems from specific functional attributes; if these are absent for any reason, it is supplanted by a different currency more suited to the task.
due to the subpar quality and unpredictable assortment of coins reaching genoa in 1673, transactions relied on bills of exchange.
presently, we understand that only precious metals, particularly gold, can ensure the essential qualities required, including limited quantity.
additionally, paper currency can only avoid the pitfalls of arbitrary inflation if it is pegged to a metal value mandated by legislation or market forces.
the essential role of gold, and formerly silver, in regulating economic functions stems from their scarcity rather than their intrinsic value matching that of goods traded.
this scarcity prevents oversaturation of the market with currency and the consequent destabilization of the price relationships central to a commodity's equivalence to a specific monetary amount.
disruption of this balance can occur from either excess issuance of currency, causing public distrust and promoting a return to barter and ious, or from reduced demand for money driving a depreciation of the circulating currency's value.
from the preceding discussion, it becomes apparent that the drawbacks of an unlimited rise in the money supply stem not solely from the increase itself, but rather from its uneven distribution.
issues like shocks, inflation, and economic stagnation arise due to the concentration of newly minted money in specific hands and its subsequent uneven dissemination.
a potential solution could lie in devising methods to distribute money more equitably and uniformly.
for instance, some argue that if every individual in england were to suddenly double their cash holdings, this would simply result in proportional price hikes without any real advantage gained by anyone.
the only noticeable change would be recalculating currency values in higher denominations.
such a scenario would not just counter arguments against fiat money but also showcase the benefits of expanding the money supply.
this is supported by the reasoning that an increased volume of money leads to more transactions, enhanced prosperity, influence, and cultural development.
more pertinent to our objectives are the considerations regarding the practical implications of this theory.
specifically, the notion that doubling all money incomes would not alter anything significantly, as all commodity prices would also double simultaneously.
this argument is flawed as it fails to account for a crucial attribute of money, known as its relative inelasticity.
this property means that introducing more money into a specific economic area does not uniformly increase all prices, but instead creates new price dynamics unrelated to individual stakeholders' interests.
inelasticity is a result of the money price of an item, despite being relative and lacking an intrinsic link to the item, establishing a certain stability and being viewed as the appropriate equivalent objectively.
when the price of an item has remained relatively constant, it typically does not adjust easily even when the value of money changes.
the demand for goods satisfying basic needs, which have limited supply, or those catering to refined needs of a niche market, would not see a significant increase with higher prices.
products falling in between these categories would be more impacted by price changes, with prices likely to remain stable for the rest.
the notion that the overall money supply increase would uniformly affect prices stands incorrect.
in reality, the relativity of prices is perpetually disrupted by a psychological factor, leading to certain commodity prices becoming rigid and absolute, challenging the idea that the quantity of money is immaterial in price determination.
one could argue that concerns regarding the potential negative impact of an unrestricted increase in the money supply are relevant primarily during transitional adjustment periods between different price levels.
such concerns assume a relationship between goods and money quantities that evolves proportionally.
it should be feasible to establish this relationship at a different level, potentially eliminating future fluctuations just as effectively as previous ones.
these doubts are applicable only to the period of change itself, and not to the completed changes which are not accountable for the maladjustments, disruptions, and challenges of the transition process.
any form of exchange is bound to enforce an adjustment eventually, ensuring that the money price of a commodity reflects the ratio between its value and the total commodity value.
consequently, an arbitrary increase in money cannot permanently disrupt this ratio.
numerous processes operate similarly: they progress towards a specific goal with clear direction, yet would compromise their defining traits if they were to achieve it.
a distinctive example from the realm of the money economy exemplifies this concept and draws a parallel to the repercussions of an unrestricted money supply on personal finances.
the pursuit of accumulating wealth is profoundly impactful in the socioeconomic sphere.
through the pursuit of maximal profit, a financial broker stimulates market activity, balances supply and demand, and injects otherwise stagnant values into the economy.
however, substantial gains in the stock market typically come from significant market fluctuations and speculative activities, rather than stable, sustainable growth.
under such circumstances, the emphasis on the production and consumption of goods, which are fundamental to society, may become excessively focused in one area while being ignored in others.
this can lead to a deviation from the path of development that aligns with the unique internal conditions and genuine needs of the society.
the distinctive nature of money serves as the foundation for the divergence between individual and social interests, which had previously been somewhat aligned.
the separation of the value of goods from the items themselves, allowing money to have an autonomous existence, contributes to the development of interests, behaviors, and standards that may sometimes conflict with those of the tangible objects it represents.
while the initiatives of private businesses linked to money initially support the social interests of goods production and consumption, there is a risk that their ultimate pursuits could undermine societal objectives.
this scenario commonly arises when emotional impulses drive towards a particular goal without realizing that the anticipated satisfaction is a result of progressing steps, which could potentially transform into the opposite upon achieving the goal.
consider, for instance, love, which gains its essence and hue from the yearning for a deep and lasting connection, often losing both qualities when the desired union is attained.
similar examples include political aspirations that fuel entire generations with vigor and idealism but, upon realization, lead to practical materialism, inertia, and conventionalism.
similarly, the pursuit of a tranquil and serene lifestyle, the ultimate aim of toil and striving, sometimes culminates in inertia and inner discontent once achieved.
it is a truism to suggest that even happiness, the ultimate pursuit, would become mundane if perpetually attained as a constant state.
this type of process can be described as the effectiveness of certain aspects of life depending on the coexistence of conflicting elements.
the ratio at which these elements and their opposites interact can vary, sometimes resulting in one element growing while the other diminishes, suggesting a progression where one element might eventually replace the other.
however, if one element were to completely overshadow the other, the meaning and effectiveness of the dominant element would also be compromised.
this dynamic can be observed in conflicts such as those between individualism and socialism.
in certain historical periods, the course of development is influenced by the latter, not just based on reality but also stemming from ideal beliefs and a developing societal concept aiming for perfection.
however, assuming in the political landscape of such eras that progress hinges solely on the rise of socialist elements can lead to the misconception that their dominance will usher in an advanced and ideal societal structure.
this notion fails to recognize that the success of socialist policies hinges on the conditions in which they are integrated into an individualistic economic framework.
while advancements made through the gradual implementation of socialist policies do signal progress, it is flawed to presume that complete adoption would signify further development.
the same principle applies during phases of heightened individualism.
the effectiveness of individualistic measures lies in the coexistence of centralized socialist institutions, which may be incrementally diminished, but their total elimination could result in unforeseen consequences starkly different from those attributed to individualism in the past.
in the realm of art, conflicting inclinations towards naturalism and mannerism follow a parallel course.
at any given stage of artistic development, there exists a blending of straightforward representation of reality and personal interpretation.
realism suggests that art advances by embracing the objective aspect.
however, when the focus shifts solely to mirroring reality, a sense of detachment arises as the artwork blends in too closely with the real world, losing its distinctiveness.
conversely, while emphasizing abstraction and idealization might temporarily elevate art, it could eventually detach so much from reality that the essence of the original representation is diluted due to the removal of individualistic nuances.
the correlation between the inherent value of currency and its dual role as a utilitarian tool and symbolic representation could evolve similarly; the latter tends to supplant the former gradually, yet a degree of the original intrinsic value must be preserved.
this is crucial to prevent the functional and symbolic essence of money from losing its fundamental underpinnings and relevance should this transition be taken to its ultimate extent.
the issue at hand isn't solely a matter of formal analogy but also concerns the unity of life's profound meaning, reflected through this external resemblance.
in practical terms, navigating the myriad elements and inclinations that constitute life necessitates adhering to a consistent and one-sided principle across various contexts and timeframes.
however, this approach repeatedly exposes us to the diversity of reality, intertwining our subjective aspirations with opposing factors to construct an empirical existence that bridges the ideal with reality.
this doesn't negate the ideal; rather, life assimilates such absolute pursuits as its components akin to how the physical world accommodates motions with inconceivable outcomes, which, upon encountering opposing forces, engender the structured realm of natural phenomena.
if the practical world is structured in a way that directs our will towards eternity and only truly interacts with the real world through redirection and resistance, then the practical framework inherently influences the theoretical framework.
many times, our perceptions of things are presented in such a pure and absolute manner that they do not mirror actual experiences, and it is only when they are countered and adjusted by opposing viewpoints that they take on an empirical shape.
yet, these concepts are not flawed due to this process; it is through this distinctive approach of extreme exaggeration followed by correction in conceptual and moral formation that a worldview consistent with our comprehension emerges.
the method by which our minds connect with the unity of existence, which is not directly visible, is to enhance and replicate it to an extreme degree in both practice and theory.
this extreme, elevated, and purified viewpoint gains authenticity and validity only when balanced by contrasting perspectives.
therefore, the basic idea of money representing the relative value of goods through measuring them against each other, devoid of any inherent value, is still valid.
in practice, this notion often competes with the opposing belief that money has its own inherent worth.
our understanding of the world is based on abstract concepts, which may differ from actuality but are justified by their role in interpreting the world.
upon deeper examination, the deconstruction of money as a tangible entity is not as groundbreaking as initially perceived.
in essence, the intrinsic value of money is synonymous with its functional value.
precious metals, though esteemed for their physical properties, are truly valued for their adornment, utility, aesthetic appeal, and other functional roles.
their worth lies not in their isolated existence, but in their utility.
the material composition of objects, apart from their utility, is generally inconsequential to us, much like many practical items whose value is derived from their functionality.
the majority of objects do not possess inherent value but acquire it through continuous emergence and interaction with other objects.
the valuation we assign to objects is intricately tied to the impact they have on us.
the middle ages harbored skepticism about charging interest primarily because money at that time seemed more concrete and prominent compared to other things, in contrast to its more fluid, variable, and adaptable nature seen in modern times.
consequently, the less vibrant and active these functions exist in reality, the more challenging they are to grasp.
in contrast to the mindset prevalent in the middle ages which centered around the concept of the physicality of money, the credit economy operates on a different premise where bills of exchange function as currency.
the middle ages primarily emphasized the tangible nature of money rather than its implications, thereby minimizing its abstract effects that were still indispensable.
the contemporary perception of money rooted in metallic standards places importance on the functionality of its physical properties, while a credit-based economy tends to shift focus from the substance of money altogether, prioritizing instead the impact it generates.
i will now analyze specific structural relationships within the economy.
i aim to demonstrate that the economy relies more on these relationships than on the actual value of money.
to illustrate this point, consider a general observation.
for instance, in human relationships, the outer appearance often fails to fully convey the depth of the connection.
this discrepancy arises because internal bonds evolve steadily, while external appearances change sporadically.
even if the two aspects align temporarily, the external facet tends to remain static while the internal bond deepens over time.
eventually, there comes a sudden advancement in the external relationship.
interestingly, this progression typically surpasses the level of intimacy reflected in the internal relationship and moves towards a more profound connection.
the prevailing conditions in spain and concerning ruling princes did not facilitate the straightforward collection of debts.
anton fugger was swayed by the emergence of new money economy systems to extend his reach well beyond what was appropriate given the actual circumstances in europe.
consequently, the debtors of these financial tycoons also did not fare any better.
the financial turmoil in sixteenth-century spain stemmed from the imbalance of money availability, with funds usually present in spain but lacking precisely where needed most in the netherlands.
this mismatch led to challenges, delays, and additional costs that contributed to the downfall of spanish finances.
conversely, other regions operated under different financial dynamics.
in the conflict between the netherlands and spain, the netherlands held a significant advantage as their funds could be efficiently utilized where needed most.
in a stable and well-organized society that offers mutual protection and safeguards against various threats, both external and psychological, paper can rise to symbolize significant monetary value.
during the middle ages, leather money was commonly employed.
paper money can be seen as a transition towards assigning money value based purely on functionality.
conversely, leather money can be viewed as an initial move in that direction.
among the defining properties of money, leather money uniquely retains relative indestructibility, a characteristic that is typically relinquished only when societal structures have evolved to a more developed state.
the monetary policies of these materialistic trends remain closely linked to the belief that material possessions symbolize inherent value.
however, a transition from a basic and fixed interpretation to a more practical understanding of the value of money is becoming evident.
the political structures of this era mirror this shift.
in regions where medieval fiscal systems still dominate, the ruler's connection to the country is superficial rather than inherent, often established through marriage or conquest.
this is exemplified by the inclination to extract maximum wealth from the land.
the frequent selling of entire territories for financial gain was a natural consequence of this approach.
such transactions solely based on money between the ruler and subjects underscored the absence of any deeper connection or bond.
values should be interchangeable directly, without the need for money as a middleman, similar to how society should be governed by all citizens without the king's involvement.
just as every citizen can vote, every commodity should hold value independently of money.
this concept, contrasting materialistic theories, has roots in the ideas of adam smith and can be categorized as a transcendental perspective.
materialism argues that the mind is a type of matter, while transcendental philosophy suggests that matter embodies the mind itself.
with the expectation of obtaining more precise knowledge, one could argue that money acts as an intermediary between the items being exchanged, much like a merchant serves as a mediator between the parties involved in the exchange.
the direct establishment of equivalence between the items is replaced, revealing the fluctuations rather than concealing them.
each item now forms a connection of equivalence and exchange with money.
the merchant embodies the role of facilitating exchange, while money represents the tangible aspect of being exchanged.
as previously mentioned, money embodies the concrete manifestation of the fundamental relationship between items in their economic interactions.
money exists independently from the individual items it relates to, operating in a system governed by its own standards which reflects the process of balancing and exchange initially carried out by the items themselves.
nonetheless, this depiction is merely an initial perspective.
ultimately, it is the individuals who are responsible for the processes, rather than the objects themselves, and the interactions between these objects essentially reflect interactions among people.
money symbolizes the exchange activities between individuals in a tangible and solidified form, akin to how government symbolizes the mutual self-regulation within a community, or how a group's unity is symbolized by objects like the palladium or the ark of the covenant, or the self-defense by the military command.
these examples showcase a common pattern where a specific aspect separates from its original context, much like a characteristic attaching to its core or an action to its doer.
this specific aspect then develops its own identity, and the process of abstraction comes to fruition when it materializes into a distinct entity.
beyond trade, money holds little value, much like armies and banners do outside the realms of communal warfare, or clergy and shrines except within communal faith.
money's duality lies in its tangible worth and its reliance on fluidity and purpose, stemming from its role as the embodiment of interpersonal trade, a symbol of pure utility.
the evolution of currency materials mirrors its sociological essence.
utilizing basic mediums like salt, livestock, tobacco, and grains serves individualistic interests, as they are often for personal consumption when no one else seeks them.
conversely, the utilization of precious metals in adornments signifies interpersonal relationships, as individuals ornament themselves for the benefit of others.
the true value of adornment lies in the psychological response it elicits from others towards the wearer.
precious metals distinguish themselves from basic means of exchange by their inherent sociological significance in facilitating interactions.
jewelry epitomizes pure exchange, representing the subtle connections between individuals where its importance to the owner is derived from its relational impact on others.
this new and expanded form of exchange occurs when the value offered by one party holds no direct significance for the other party but represents a claim on other tangible values.
this claim's actualization relies on the wider economic community or on the government as its agent.
transitioning from barter to monetary transactions adds a third element between the parties: the broader community, which underpins the value of money.
the focal point of their interaction shifts from their direct interaction to the association each has with the economic community through their interest in money, backed by the authority of the government that mints the money.
this concept underscores the idea that money essentially represents a claim on society.
the concept of economic credit embodies a belief beyond pure theory, linked to the confidence in the community to uphold the value of tokens received in exchange for our labor.
this notion combines a form of basic induction with a layer of quasi-religious social-psychological faith.
the sense of security associated with possessing money epitomizes confidence in the socio-political structure.
this subjective process represents a heightened aspect of the subjectivity involved in assigning value to precious metals.
while this original valuation is a crucial starting point, it translates practically into monetary transactions through mutual faith.
the transition from material currency to credit money is more of a gradual evolution, as credit money essentially signifies the advancement and increasing autonomy of credit components already present in material currency.
the commitment to ensure the ongoing utility of money, a key aspect of the relationship between parties and society at large, takes on a unique form.
in theory, there is no absolute guarantee as money owners cannot compel others to exchange goods or services for money, even if the currency in question is universally accepted.
this limitation becomes apparent during boycotts.
only in cases of pre-existing obligations can a creditor be legally obligated to accept money as repayment, though this is not consistent across all legal frameworks.
the fact that there is always a risk that money may not fulfill its intended purpose underscores its nature as a form of credit.
it is intrinsic to credit that its realization is never certain, no matter how likely it may be.
while individuals have the freedom to trade their goods or assets for money or retain them, society at large has a responsibility to honor the value represented by money.
opposing trends often validate the same principle.
during the medieval era, the crucial benefit of the rights of coinage lied in the sovereign's ability to mint fresh pennies at will within his territory and mandate the exchange of all existing or foreign coins with the newly minted ones.
with each devaluation of the currency, the ruler gained from the variance between the new and old coins.
this economic advantage was most effective in larger domains since in smaller regions, the privilege of coinage was less lucrative due to limited coin circulation.
if the profitability of devaluing currency was not tied to the region's size, the multitude of coins in circulation in germany could have been even more chaotic, given how freely coinage privileges were granted to various monasteries and small towns.
the stability of the socioeconomic framework within a domain necessitated a reliable currency, making the profits from circulating debased money quite substantial.
as trade opportunities increase, it becomes crucial to make the currency appealing and acceptable to foreign entities and trade allies.
as economic reach expands, there is typically a decrease in direct interactions.
this reduced contact leads to limited mutual understanding of conditions, lower confidence levels, and uncertainties in fulfilling claims.
in such scenarios, sellers are hesitant to provide goods if the payment received can only be used within the buyer's region and holds uncertain value elsewhere.
hence, vendors prefer to receive universally accepted currency that holds intrinsic value and can be utilized globally.
the rise in the tangible worth of currency symbolizes its increased acceptance among a wider range of people.
in smaller groups, its tradability may rely on social, legal, and personal assurances.
if we consider the acceptance of money to be based on its usefulness, its actual value can be seen as a guarantee of that utility.
in cases where negotiability is ensured through alternative methods, the material value of money may be insignificant, but it will be elevated in high-risk situations.
over time, expanding economic interactions will imbue larger, even global, communities with the same characteristics once typical only in more closed groups.
economic and legal frameworks will transcend geographical boundaries, operating just as effectively across vast distances as they did within local communities.
as this occurs, the guarantee provided by the inherent value of money can be diminished.
money in the past was obtained through unproductive means like war, tribute, and money-changing.
similarly, loans were often given for consumption rather than for productive purposes.
as a result, interest couldn't naturally be seen as a byproduct of capital.
the ambiguous and disconnected relationship between capital and interest stemming from this arrangement made it challenging to understand the issue of interest, a challenge that persisted well into the christian era.
it was only with the emergence of the concept and reality of productive capital that a viable solution started to materialize.
this starkly contrasts with the modern era, where the value of capital is determined not by its essence, but by its functionality.
from being a static entity detached from production, capital has evolved into an active component integral to the production process.
this perspective fails to acknowledge that the distinction between metallic and paper currency is essentially arbitrary.
both forms of money serve as a representation of the exchange function facilitated by a mutual agreement among parties involved and are reliant on an established institution.
for money to function effectively, the issuing institution must reflect and uphold the collective interests of the community it serves.
in some cases, local leaders endeavor to imbue their coins with the semblance of originating from a more encompassing institution.
long after the reigns of philip and alexander, coins bearing their names and symbols were produced in various locations, appearing as royal currency when, in reality, they belonged to specific cities.
the evolution of monetary systems emphasizes the enhancement and centralization of institutions and authorities responsible for safeguarding currency values.
notably, the introduction of treasury bonds by governments prior to the eighteenth century established a precedent by enabling claims on the overall state revenue.
however, the primary argument is that the importance of metal in financial matters is gradually diminishing compared to communal protection mechanisms.
metal fundamentally remains private property, and public interests and forces can never fully control it.
money is evolving into a more public institution, shaped increasingly by public authorities, institutions, social interactions, and general public endorsements.
in earlier times, money was not solely defined by its abstract function; it was closely linked to specific business operations, coin production processes, or precious metal trading.
for instance, around the early 13th century, common exchange activities were overseen by individuals such as cloth-dyers in vienna and goldsmiths in england and partially in germany.
the detachment of money from personal connection and its strengthening tie to a centralized and broader society are closely linked to the emphasis on functions that are unrelated to the actual metallic value.
the worth of money now hinges on a security provided by the central political authority, gradually superseding the importance of the metal itself.
this mirrors an overlooked aspect of valuation, where an object's value lies in its ability to facilitate the acquisition of another object.
in such cases, the value depends on two factors: the inherent value of the desired item and the certainty of obtaining it.
if one factor decreases, the overall value might remain unchanged within certain boundaries, provided the other factor increases simultaneously.
hence, the significance of a perception hinges on both its reliability and the importance of the perceived object.
in the realm of natural sciences, reliability carries more weight, whereas in the social sciences, the perceived object's significance is paramount.
therefore, there can be an equal footing in the perceived value between these two domains.
upholding aristotle's view of unwavering knowledge certainty is crucial for attributing the value of perception solely to the object's worth.
the value of a lottery ticket is determined by the likelihood of it being drawn and the potential prize size.
similarly, an action's value is a combination of the probability of achieving its goal and the goal's significance.
a bond's value is contingent on the security of the principal and the interest rate.
money operates differently as its reliability increases without affecting the value of what it can purchase.
however, the comparison remains valid in that the assurance of coins being accepted at face value allows for a decrease in the metal content's intrinsic value without changing the overall value.
additionally, the sociological impact of money strengthens the relationship between the group's central authority and its members, as interactions among the members are now mediated by the central power.
the carolingian rulers notably aimed to transition from bartering and trading livestock to a monetary system, enforcing acceptance of coins and penalizing refusals.
the pattern of influential rulers establishing robust monetary systems is a recurring theme throughout history.
notable figures such as darius i, alexander the great, augustus, diocletian, and even napoleon i exemplified this practice.
this strategy, prevalent from ancient times to the napoleonic era, facilitated the consolidation of social power within a barter economy, fostering independence and creating quasi-independent state entities, akin to the vast territorial domains under the merovingians.
in contrast, counterparts in monetary economies have tended to align with state structures.
the evolution of the modern centralized state can be attributed in part to the substantial expansion of the monetary economy that ensued with the exploitation of gold and silver reservoirs in america.
the self-sufficiency of feudalism unraveled as transactions became reliant on coins, necessitating a central authority.
this expanded the connections between parties beyond currency itself, strengthening the monetary ties that bound individuals to the monarchy.
the transition from barter to monetary economies played a pivotal role in the breakdown of the german empire, accentuating the power struggle between territorial rulers and the german emperors.
in contrast, the french and english monarchs of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries harnessed the financial shift to consolidate state unity.
even after the unification of the russian empire, ivan iii strategically granted regional sovereignty to his younger sons, while reserving coinage rights and judicial control for the central authority.
the expansion of informal trade relations across political borders significantly increases when the established currency gains stability and widespread acceptance, facilitating closer economic ties with the originating country.
for instance, the strong exchange rate of the english sovereign elevated english trade in portugal and brazil, fostering closer economic connections.
in early medieval germany post the carolingian era, the king authorized various individuals and religious institutions to mint coins while maintaining control over the coins' composition and quality.
prior to the twelfth century, coinage rights holders had autonomy in setting coin standards and forms, allowing them to profit as they saw fit.
while most objects are subject to wear and replacement, money possesses exceptional durability that shields it from the cycle of constant change in individual items.
this enduring quality elevates money to a status above mere objects, akin to how the cohesive essence of a social group transcends the diverse characteristics of its members.
these abstracted group functions exist independently of real individuals, forming stable entities amidst fleeting individual expressions that are molded by and eventually released back into them.
an illustration of this concept is the enduring legacy of a king, which remains unaffected by the uncertainties of his personal actions or the evolving circumstances of his society.
the near-indestructible coin bearing his likeness serves as a symbolic representation of this eternal aspect.
the origins of large-scale finance trace back to the sixteenth century when princes engaged in financial transactions, elevating financiers to a prestigious status through their association with royalty.
this historical development led to a perception where trade in goods was considered less prestigious compared to financial dealings with monarchs.
socialists' criticism of finance extends beyond its influence in capitalist-worker dynamics to potentially encompass anti-monarchical sentiments.
although the centralization of economic power facilitated by money does not inherently demand a monarchical structure, historical trends show that monarchies have been instrumental in enabling central authority's involvement in economic matters.
additionally, the need for fixed royal residences, which support centralization, became feasible with the introduction of monetary taxes, as opposed to taxes paid in goods which are impractical for a mobile court.
in line with this philosophy, contemporary tax policy typically assigns taxes on real estate to local authorities while reserving income tax for the state.
by directing the tax burden of the central government towards an individual's monetary income, it targets the type of property that it has the strongest ties with.
the evolution of bureaucracy, closely linked to finance, reflects the trend towards centralization.
in feudal times, administration was decentralized, and the vassal's remote land possessions created a divide from the central authority.
conversely, regular monetary contributions pull officials towards central power, reinforcing their reliance on it.
in the early 19th century, due to currency devaluation, the sublime porte was compelled to produce coins of double weight for officials and officers, underlining the necessity for full-value currency in their interactions with state personnel.
in greek culture, the concept of unity was symbolized by religious rather than political connections.
money in ancient greece held a sacred status, originating from the priesthood along with other fundamental principles related to measurement, such as weight, size, and time.
the priesthood served as a unifying force among diverse regions.
early groupings were primarily religiously oriented and often spanned considerable geographic areas.
temples had a universal centralizing importance, and currency reflected this by featuring symbols of shared deities.
the religious cohesion embodied by temples was reinvigorated through the circulation of money, which transcended mere metal value.
as these social structures evolved, the role of money expanded in importance relative to its material composition.
various examples and considerations can elucidate this transformation.
the value of money can fluctuate independently of its intrinsic worth due to the manipulation of the money supply, despite its inherent stability correlated with its material value.
in ancient rome, gold and silver coin minting was controlled by the roman emperors, ensuring these coins' value.
conversely, copper coins, chiefly used in daily transactions, were minted by the senate or towns in the eastern provinces.
this system aimed to prevent flooding the market with lower denomination coins.
over time, the emperors devalued the silver currency, causing the ultimate collapse of the roman coinage.
as a consequence, silver coins lost value and became common for transactions, while copper coins, retaining their value, gained prominence as the standard measure of worth.
the original function of metals as indicators of monetary value was altered due to a shift in their relative value stability.
recently, there has been a focus on the increased importance of stability in value over material worth.
it has been argued that transitioning from paper currency to the gold standard does not necessarily mean a return to gold payments.
for instance, in a country like austria, where currency notes are equivalent to silver, adopting the gold standard would offer the significant benefit of stabilizing the value of money, achieving this without the need to use gold physically.
the growing concern for stable monetary value has also sparked discussions about the possibility of eliminating the metal reserves that back the issuance of notes.
as long as such reserves are in place, countries are part of a collective system where domestic transactions are influenced by the political and economic fluctuations in other nations.
unbacked paper currency, because of its inability to be traded abroad, offers the benefit of being accessible for various domestic ventures and, most importantly, of maintaining consistent value.
despite potential criticisms of this notion, the mere proposal demonstrates the separation of money as a concept from its physical form and its evolution towards functional utility.
these monetary functions are reliant on the overall decomposition of money into separate roles, which are only partially applicable at any given moment, signaling an ongoing developmental trajectory that is never fully achieved.
the abstract nature of the values and relationships that money is intended to represent renders achieving stability in measurement akin to spatial or weight standards unattainable, given that they are purely psychological.
in practical terms, the stability of value is regarded as a given when addressing any concerns regarding the repayment of a loan after the value of money has shifted.
if the value of money has decreased overall, resulting in the repaid amount being worth less, the law typically ignores this change; treating the same sum as having the same value.
in cases where the currency has been debased through mixing with other metals or altering its standard, legal decisions may require the repayment to align with the new standard, the metal content of the new standard, or simply the face value of the money.
generally, it is commonly believed that the value of money remains constant.
however, this stability doesn't apply to other items, as it is acknowledged that, for instance, fifty pounds of lent potatoes in the spring can have varying values when returned later.
in such a scenario, the intrinsic value of the object can be considered; even though the market value of potatoes may vary, their worth in providing satisfaction and nourishment remains constant.
unlike commodities like potatoes, money lacks inherent value and solely holds exchange value, making its perceived stability all the more remarkable.
practical considerations are likely to contribute to solidifying this essential fiction.
i have previously mentioned that in the case of money crafted from precious metals, its association with jewelry helps uphold its stable value.
the demand for jewelry being quite flexible, it can absorb a large portion of the increasing supply of precious metals, thereby preventing excessive devaluation.
additionally, a rising demand for money can be met by utilizing existing jewelry reserves, ensuring the necessary quantity can be obtained without inflating the price of precious metals.
the ongoing trend suggests a shift towards striving for the total eradication of the physical foundation of money.
even valuable materials like precious metals are subject to fluctuations influenced by specific demand, production, and processing conditions, which are independent of their function as a medium of exchange and a representation of the relative value of goods.
true stability in the value of money could only be achieved if it existed purely as a reflection of the value exchange between tangible goods.
in this scenario, money would assume a neutral stance, unaffected by the ebbs and flows of the market, similar to how a yardstick remains constant despite measuring varying lengths.
optimal stability in the established value of money would be realized through this abstraction, as regulating the balance between supply and demand would become more manageable without reliance on an uncontrollable material quantity.
returning to the earlier analogies, the deepest and most profound love may exist between two souls, transcending physical desires.
however, in reality, love often thrives when a spiritual connection is enriched by a strong physical bond.
while paradise could offer eternal bliss without the need for contrasting emotions, our human experience necessitates a balance between happiness and other feelings like pain and indifference.
similarly, even though an ideal society may function without money having inherent value, the current satisfaction often lies in money tied to a tangible substance.
this temporary state aligns with the ongoing shift towards money becoming a symbolic representation of its core purpose.
this discussion brings us to the concept of representing monetary values through equivalents, highlighting one of the key functions of money, which is to enhance the transferability of values.
as money's role as a medium of exchange, a unit of measurement, and a store of value grows in importance compared to its physical form, it becomes more fluid in circulation beyond just being metal.
the evolution of money representations is evident in the transition from promissory notes exchanged between individuals to bearer bills.
the progression through these different forms of representation warrants further examination to fully grasp its development.
the concept of allowing both the bearer and the original creditor to collect a debt was present as far back as the middle ages.
however, its original purpose was to streamline the debt collection process by enabling a representative of the creditor to act on their behalf, rather than enabling the transfer of the debt's value.
this symbolic transfer of paper assets took on a more tangible form with the french billet en blanc, which circulated on the stock exchange in lyons.
although initially worded to allude to a specific creditor without specifying their name, the actual creditor was only identified once a name was filled in the blank space.
the practice of trading bills of exchange was formalized in antwerp during the sixteenth century.
initially, these bills risked being refused if not accompanied by a transfer note at maturity, prompting an imperial decree to establish their general acceptance.
this historical progression highlights the evolution of these financial instruments through distinct phases.
it is worth noting as a general observation that credit and cash do not merely substitute for each other, but rather stimulate increased activity in each other.
in instances when there is a surplus of cash in the market, credit transactions tend to expand significantly, sometimes excessively, as seen in the sixteenth century when substantial imports of precious metals led to a risky expansion of credit and frenzied speculation in company ventures in germany.
the correlation between the growth of money supply and credit indicates that they serve similar purposes, with the enhancement of one leading to heightened activity in the other.
this dynamic does not negate the complementary relationship between money and credit, where credit can diminish the need for physical cash.
for example, historical records indicate that there was a reduced availability of currency in england in 1838 compared to fifty years earlier, despite a significant increase in production.
similarly, france experienced a decrease in cash circulation following the revolution.
the interconnected nature of two phenomena stemming from a common motive, wherein they both serve to both boost and potentially surpass each other, is a common and comprehensible occurrence.
it is important to note that the core emotion of love can materialize both physically and emotionally, with the ability to reinforce each other, while also sometimes leading to the exclusion of one by the other.
frequently, a dynamic interplay between these dual potentials allows for the fullest and most vibrant expression of the fundamental emotion.
the importance of credit lies in its dual role of stimulating increased cash flow and substituting for the need for physical cash transactions, underscoring the interconnectedness of these two forms of exchange mechanisms.
ultimately, some of the impacts of money possess a perception that diverges from the inherent nature of the monetary material itself.
money's role includes not only consolidating but also symbolizing the economic value of objects within its unique framework.
the total monetary value paid for an object encompasses the worth of all its potential uses, which could span an extended duration, along with the specific values of its distinct components and the value of all the efforts and resources that contributed to, and culminated in, money.
regardless of the number of coins involved, a monetary price remains a cohesive entity.
the complete interchangeability of its components restricts the essence of money solely to its numerical value, and these components together create a comprehensive unity rarely found elsewhere in practical situations.
money serves as a significant cultural element, consolidating powerful forces to combat resistance and facilitate the achievement of our goals through concentrated energies.
it is essential to consider machinery within this framework, as it not only directs forces towards our objectives but also intensifies work demands on workers with advancements.
this dynamic underscores the crucial correlation between technological advancement, reduced work hours, and the enhanced concentration of nature and human capabilities to further our objectives.
the shift towards prioritizing laws of nature in shaping our worldview reflects a cultural trend.
unlike the narrower focus on individual phenomena or the randomness of basic empiricism, laws of nature condense vast knowledge into concise formulas.
each law encapsulates the traits and behaviors of countless occurrences.
by utilizing laws of nature, the mind organizes a broad spectrum of spatial and temporal events into a coherent system that essentially encompasses the entire world.
it is not contradictory to argue that the functions once held by smaller close-knit communities have now mostly transitioned to a larger and more expansive entity, such as the state.
in terms of its accomplishments, the modern state, with its bureaucracy, authority, and centralization, operates at a higher level of intensity than its primitive predecessors.
the contemporary state thrives on an extraordinary consolidation, amalgamation, and standardization of all political resources.
in comparison to the inefficiencies of a nation fragmented into numerous independent communities, the concentrated forces represented by both the individual's autonomy and the modern state are unparalleled.
this evolution allows society's resources to be streamlined efficiently, requiring minimal effort to produce maximum results for each unique requirement.
this process could be described as the progressive spiritualization of money, as the fundamental nature of mental activity is to create unity from diversity.
in the physical world, objects coexist independently, while in the realm of the intellect, they are harmonized.
components of an idea come together in harmony, just as subject and predicate combine in a statement; this unity is not found in the realm of observable phenomena.
the living organism, acting as a connection between physical matter and consciousness, serves as the initial step towards such unity; its components interact and strive for an elusive perfect wholeness.
true integration occurs solely within the realm of the mind.
through the exchange process, a mental blending of values is achieved.
the spatial extension of physical substance highlights the disjointed nature of material existence, contrasting with money's abstract representation of exchange.
money only becomes genuine when its material aspects diminish, transforming into a true unit of currency that unifies and integrates value components, a task achievable only through mental processes.
if money's functions can be partly carried out alongside its physical form and partly independently of the quantity of that physical form, a decrease in the value of money does not necessarily indicate a general devaluation of money overall, but rather a devaluation of specific quantities.
these two occurrences are not synonymous, and it could be argued that the less valuable a particular amount of money becomes, the more valuable money is in general.
it is only when money is in abundance and each unit is less valuable that it can circulate widely, have quick transactions, and serve its intended purpose effectively.
a similar correlation between a specific amount of money and money as a whole also occurs in individuals' minds.
those who are most willing to part with money for specific purchases are typically the ones most reliant on money in general.
this elucidates the notion that true disregard for money can only come when one possesses it in abundance.
for instance, the larger and more significant a social group grows, the less value is often placed on the lives and interests of its individual members.
the richness and diversity of an objective culture reach their peak through a division of labor that tends to confine individuals to monotonous specializations, leading to narrow perspectives and hindered personal growth.
the collective unity and perfection of the whole are achieved at the expense of individual harmonious development.
this occurrence is mirrored in non-personal entities as well.
the beauty and flawlessness of particular poems lie in the fact that individual words lack autonomy; instead, they serve to enhance the predominant emotion or artistic intent of the entire piece, excluding diverse connotations, except for those that directly relate to the poem's overarching theme.
the poem as a whole attains greater artistic perfection as its individual components shed their standalone meanings.
the chinese government establishes its monopoly with strict regulations through laws that mete out harsher punishments to counterfeiters using genuine precious metals compared to those using substandard materials.
this is because the former engages in more direct competition with the government, thus encroaching on its authority on a deeper level.
allowing unrestricted minting of coins would lead to their depreciation to the value of the raw materials plus labor costs, nullifying the benefits of a monopoly.
ethnologists have noted that when everyone can mint coins, as seen with shell money, the power and authority of wealthy individuals and leaders can easily crumble.
conversely, anyone in possession of money thereby shares in the state's privilege to mint currency, akin to how a buyer of a patented product shares the inventor's patent rights.
the aesthetic process involves transforming and giving tangible form to emotions, which is key in the creation and appreciation of art.
similarly, cognition is valued for its role in reflecting the outside world through the mind, regardless of whether the outcomes are pleasing or not, practical or fantastical.
this distinction in valuing emotions holds another crucial aspect.
the rise of the contemporary naturalistic mindset aims to diminish the importance of universal ideas and highlight the significance of specific occurrences as the valid basis of understanding.
the abstract nature of universality is viewed as meaningful only when manifested in tangible examples.
moving beyond these particulars can feel like traversing into emptiness.
however, the understanding of the importance of universal concepts, which peaked during plato's time, has not entirely faded.
a truly comprehensive worldview would need to harmonize the material existence of individual occurrences with the profound and extensive nature of abstract universality.
the concepts of historicism and a sociological perspective aim to acknowledge universality while eschewing pure abstraction, striving to transcend individual instances by deriving them from general principles without negating their material reality.
society, being universal but not abstract, illustrates this balance.
the distinction between functions and content is crucial in this context, with functions being universal in serving a purpose.
religious sentiment, for example, is universal independent of distinct creeds, while cognition is universal across various objects of focus, and power is universal in its application to diverse but similar problems.
these concepts serve as inclusive frameworks capable of accommodating a wide array of material realities.
the debate on whether causality or teleology is pertinent to human actions can be resolved as follows.
as the outcomes of actions take shape in a psychologically influential manner before manifesting objectively, a firm causal connection can be affirmed.
it is essential to consider only intellectual concepts that have transformed into psychological motivators, highlighting a clear distinction between cause and effect.
the alignment of the intellectual motive's content with the consequences is unrelated to the physical unfolding of events.
this does not imply that the true purpose of all purposeful actions is rooted solely in the acting subject, or that the motivation to achieve a goal always stems from the emotions evoked retroactively by the object.
while this dynamic may apply to self-centered actions, there are numerous other instances where the intention behind an act is solely focused on accomplishing the objective, with little regard to subjective feelings.
the intrinsic drive guiding our actions frequently considers only the concrete result, excluding any subsequent emotional reactions from the goal-oriented process.
nevertheless, unless the outcomes of our endeavors eventually evoke an emotional response within us, the mere conceptualization of those outcomes would not spark any drive to bring them to fruition.
although emotions play a crucial role in propelling actions, they do not always signify the ultimate goal.
our purpose-driven intentions often culminate at achieving the objective result, without delving consciously into what lies beyond this point.
this contrast emphasizes the specific importance of the aforementioned point, highlighting that purposeful action involves a dynamic between the determined individual and the external environment.
the link between the intention and its fulfillment establishes both a connection and a distinction between them.
this link indicates the inability of the intention to achieve fulfillment independently, serving as the barrier that the intention must surpass.
purposefulness is fundamentally a relational concept as it always involves an external element that needs to be changed.
without this necessary transformation, without the need to adapt the intention, the formation of aims would not occur.
our own actions in pursuit of our objectives represent the primary instance where we recognize the dual nature of the means; in such endeavors, we encounter both the opposition of external circumstances and the conversion of this opposition into energy that surpasses awareness, each evolving its distinct characteristics.
if our action does not directly result in achieving our intended goal but requires triggering another external event that ultimately leads to the desired outcome, then the intermediary occurrences share the same characteristic as our initial action; both serve as mechanisms connecting one mind to another.
they both play a role in the sequence of events that starts and concludes in the mind.
the average number of steps in this sequence within a particular existence reflects the level of understanding and influence over the environment, as well as the extent and sophistication of the lifestyle.
it is at this point that societal intricacies arise, eventually leading to the inception of currency.
the occurrence of a teleological chain is contingent upon understanding the causal connections among its elements.
in return, the intended goal stimulates the inclination to explore causal relationships.
therefore, the feasibility of a teleological chain relies on causal connections, while the interest in this causal chain, its psychological feasibility, emerges from the pursuit of an objective.
this dynamic, representing the relationship between theory and practice in a broad sense, indicates that a deeper understanding of causality is intricately linked with a deeper understanding of teleology.
the number of objectives in the series is determined by the length of the causal sequence; conversely, having appropriate means frequently results not only in achieving a goal but also in conceptualizing it.
to grasp the importance of blending natural and mental aspects of life, it is crucial to consider the concept that achieving significant goals often requires a lengthy chain of steps with multiple components rather than a short sequence.
primitive individuals, lacking in-depth knowledge of natural phenomena, face limitations in their goal-oriented endeavors.
their strategies generally encompass only their physical actions and the immediate impact on a single entity.
if the anticipated outcome does not materialize, they might resort to supernatural forces, hoping for a resolution beyond their control.
this transition to seeking magical intervention is viewed not as a progression in goal setting but rather an indication of the perceived unattainability of the goal.
when the brief sequence of actions falls short, the goal may be abandoned or might not even be conceived at all.
the extension of the series implies that the individual increasingly relies on the inherent capabilities of objects to assist him.
as essential needs are met, more connections are necessary in the sequential progression, and only a profound understanding of causality can minimize the number of links by uncovering more direct relationships and quicker routes within the natural order.
this might result in a reversal of the natural pattern: during relatively early stages, fulfilling basic life requirements involves straightforward sequences of intentions, while achieving higher and more complex needs demands more intricate approaches.
nevertheless, technological advancements commonly offer uncomplicated and efficient means of meeting those advanced needs, while providing for basic life necessities encounters mounting challenges that necessitate more elaborate solutions.
in essence, cultural advancement tends to lengthen the progression for immediate needs and abbreviate it for distant ones.
in the examination of purposive action, it is crucial to consider the significant role of tools.
the fundamental aspect of teleological progression involves our actions resulting in responses from an external object.
these reactions, guided by their inherent characteristics, ultimately lead to the intended outcomes.
when tools are employed, they act as an intermediary between the agent and the object.
they not only intervene spatially and temporally but also in their essence.
while a tool functions as a functional object, it also serves as an extension of ourselves, operated not just upon but alongside.
essentially, a tool serves as an enhanced instrument with a predetermined form and existence designed for a specific purpose, contrasting with natural objects that are adapted later to fulfill our needs in the primary teleological process.
when a person plants a seed with the intention of harvesting the fruit of the plant in the future rather than being content with wild fruits, they are acting with purpose, though this intention is confined to their intervention.
by using tools like a spade and hoe, they distance themselves from natural processes that typically unfold on their own, emphasizing the role of human agency over natural forces.
employing tools represents a deliberate insertion of a new element in the chain of purposeful actions, illustrating that the most direct path is not always the swiftest.
tools exemplify human creations in the external world, uniquely crafted by human hands to serve specific functions.
unlike an end in itself, a tool lacks the inherent autonomy associated with an end, existing purely as a means to an end.
the concept of the tool extends beyond the physical realm.
when self-interest involves mental or non-material aspects, the tool evolves into a more sophisticated form, becoming a manifestation of our will without the constraints of material attributes.
social institutions exemplify this type of tool, enabling individuals to achieve outcomes beyond their personal capabilities.
for instance, state membership offers essential protection for individual goals, while civil legal institutions facilitate accomplishments that would otherwise be unattainable.
through legal mechanisms like contracts, wills, and adoptions, individuals leverage collectively established tools to enhance their abilities, broaden their impact, and achieve their objectives effectively.
religious rites, similar to material tools, are utilized by the church to externalize the collective emotions of the religious community.
they may deviate from the central purpose of religious sentiment, yet they function as a unique tool that helps individuals achieve aims that are otherwise out of reach.
finally, we have arrived at the juncture where money assumes its place within the intricate web of intentions.
let us commence with a foundation of widely acknowledged truths.
all financial transactions are founded on the concept that i desire something owned by another individual, and they are willing to exchange it with me if i offer something in return that they desire.
it is clear that the completion of this reciprocal process may not always occur simultaneously with its initiation; there are instances where i covet object a in possession of a, while the item or service b that i am ready to provide in exchange may not capture a's interest.
alternatively, the commodities proposed may be agreeable to both parties, but reaching a consensus on the quantities involved could prove challenging.
unlike the other institutions previously discussed, money seldom conceals its nature as a tool.
unlike entities with an inherent purpose, money is impartial and detached from the goals it helps achieve.
it remains indifferent to the objects themselves, existing solely as a medium of exchange.
money facilitates the trading of goods rather than possessing them, making it a neutral intermediary.
in its perfected state, money is a pure means unaffected by external factors, serving as a tool devoid of its own agenda, solely aiding in achieving specific ends within a series of objectives.
the tool serves as a reflection of both the magnificence of human determination and its constraints.
the necessity to introduce various steps between our goals has led to the notion of the past and contributed to shaping humankind's perception of life, its boundaries, and its continuity as a dividing line between what has been and what is yet to come.
money stands out as the ultimate embodiment of resources, a tangible tool perfectly aligned with its conceptual value; it represents pure utility.
the profound significance of money in uncovering the fundamental drives of existence lies in its capacity to encapsulate and elevate the pragmatic connection between individuals and their desires, strengths, and vulnerabilities.
in a somewhat paradoxical manner, one could argue that humans exist indirectly through their relationship with money.
as previously observed, the availability of materials and resources can inspire us to form specific purposes that can be achieved through the creation and utilization of means.
it is worth noting that the inception of a purpose can lead to identifying the necessary means, creating a cyclical relationship between the two.
this phenomenon, although subject to adjustments, remains consistent and can be exemplified in the context of tools, which epitomize a fundamental form of means.
unlike basic means that are exhausted upon fulfilling a specific objective, a tool persists beyond its initial use, offering potential for diverse, unforeseen applications.
this principle extends beyond common occurrences in daily life to more intricate scenarios.
for example, military structures established for external operations may be repurposed by ruling entities for internal political agendas.
naturally, money can only be ultimately spent on one item, but its ability to provide choices adds value.
money is not tied to any specific purpose, creating connections to various potential goals.
as a versatile tool, money holds significant value due to its countless unpredictable uses.
its open-ended possibilities, stemming from its lack of inherent content, are demonstrated positively by money's restlessness, indicating its desire to be utilized across a range of purposes.
ultimately, all commodities can only be traded for one common value - money.
in contrast to labor, which is often difficult to shift between different roles, money in its capital form can easily transition from one investment to another, potentially resulting in profit.
unlike a worker who is typically bound to their specific skill set, money owners have the advantage of flexibility in their choices, similar to merchants.
therefore, the value of money extends beyond its purchasing power for a specific item; it incorporates the additional value of the freedom to choose among various goods, a unique asset not shared by commodities or labor.
the significance of this surplus value of money becomes particularly apparent when considering the implications of the decisions it empowers in reality.
it has been argued that a commodity, when limited in quantity and possessing multiple possible uses, will be valued by its owners based on its most crucial function, rendering all other uses appear impractical.
conversely, when there is an abundance of goods surpassing the need for all potential uses, such goods will be valued based on their least essential purpose, with the measure of value shifting to the least important use.
this principle is exemplified most convincingly by money, given its universal utility across various economic needs, allowing a specific amount to be allocated to address the most pressing subjective need at any given moment.
in contrast to other commodities subject to limitations, the selection of goods and services is vast due to boundless human desires.
this competition among various possible uses for a given sum of money means that it will always be allocated towards the most intensely desired item.
the value of money is therefore determined by the most significant interest at any given moment.
unlike a constrained supply of wood or a specific plot of land that can only fulfill one desired purpose, and thus is valued based on the most valuable use, money transcends such restrictions.
its value aligns with the paramount universal interest of the individual that can be met within the existing supply.
all other factors being equal, a commodity holds more value if it is not immediately necessary for use.
the value of commodities varies between two extremes, with one end being items that can be utilized at a later time.
for instance, if one exchanges fish caught in the summer for furs to be worn in the winter, the fish gains value as it can be consumed promptly, while the furs lose value due to potential damage or devaluation during the waiting period.
conversely, the fish's value decreases as it won't remain fresh, whereas the furs' value increases as they will still be usable later on.
to serve as a suitable form of currency, an item must possess these qualities that enhance its value.
it might seem contradictory, but the stronger the desire to possess something or establish a relationship, the more intense and passionate the enjoyment derived from it becomes.
the level of anticipated enjoyment plays a crucial role in determining the intensity of our desires.
surprisingly, this dynamic actually favors the less interested participant, as it is common for the party benefiting less to receive some concessions from the other.
this principle is observable even in the most intricate and close relationships.
in every romantic relationship, the individual displaying less emotional investment holds an advantage because the other party willingly refrains from any form of exploitation from the outset, is more willing to make compromises, and expresses a higher degree of devotion in return for the greater satisfaction they experience.
money possesses a paradoxical quality where its association with lack of character actually highlights its positive aspects.
someone deemed to have a weak character is often swayed more by external forces rather than internal values.
money, being abstract and solely quantifiable, tends to attract individuals solely driven by monetary gain, thereby appearing devoid of inherent character.
this trait is an inevitable consequence of the advantages and emphasis placed on financial wealth over qualitative values.
a distinctive feature of money's power lies in how it motivates sellers more fervently than buyers.
a key aspect of our overall perspective on objects is at play here: when comparing two contrasting sets of values as a whole, the first set may be clearly superior to the second set, even though individual objects or representatives from the second set may excel those from the first.
presented with a choice between all material possessions and all ideal values, we would likely opt for the former since relinquishing it would mean denying life, along with all its ideal aspects.
however, we may readily sacrifice any singular material possession for an ideal one.
in our interactions with others, we acknowledge that one relationship is far more valuable and essential than another when considering the entirety; nevertheless, on specific occasions and in specific contexts, the less valuable relationship may be more enjoyable and appealing.
this gives rise to a broader phenomenon that could be described as the additional value of wealth, akin to the unearned rent from land ownership.
the affluent individual enjoys benefits that go beyond just what his money can purchase.
the merchant serves him with greater reliability and at lower cost than he does for less wealthy individuals.
everyone he encounters, regardless of whether they stand to gain from his wealth, treats him with more deference.
he operates within an environment of unquestioned privilege.
one can see various small perks being bestowed upon those who buy expensive items or travel first-class; privileges that are as unrelated to actual value as the friendly demeanor of a merchant is to the price of the goods being sold.
these perks are an extra, undeserved add-on, and one of the most troubling aspects might be that those purchasing cheaper goods, who are not granted these privileges, have no grounds to complain of being shortchanged.
this can be best exemplified by a minute scenario.
in certain cities, streetcars have two distinct classes with varying prices.
interestingly, the higher-priced class does not necessarily provide any additional physical comfort.
essentially, when a traveler purchases a first-class ticket, they are essentially securing the privilege of mingling with a more elite group of passengers who are willing to pay extra to separate themselves from the second-class passengers.
this means that affluent individuals can gain an advantage by simply spending more money, even if they do not receive any tangible benefits in return for their expenditure.
they project an image of an ambiguous influence that is not limited to attaining a specific outcome, and this impression gets even more robust when the possessions are more fluid and readily available for any purpose.
in other words, the greater the share of money or its convertibility, and the more distinctly money functions as a tool and a conduit devoid of any inherent purpose.
the intrinsic potential of money as a resource is refined into a broad perception of authority and importance that translates into tangible power and significance for the money holder.
it resembles the allure of an artwork, which is not only shaped by its content and connected emotional responses but also by all the incidental, personal, and indirect emotional layers that it enables.
the cumulative sum of these emotions encapsulates the total value and significance of an artwork.
if this explanation of the unearned increase in wealth holds true, then the increase will be more significant when the owner's circumstances offer better opportunities and more freedom to utilize it.
a person with limited resources has the fewest options as their income only covers essential needs, providing minimal flexibility in decision-making.
this flexibility grows as income rises, with each additional earning being more valuable as it can be used beyond fulfilling basic requirements.
consequently, a higher income includes a larger share of unearned increment until a certain income threshold is reached.
at that point, the phenomenon under scrutiny can be viewed within a specific frame, which i find particularly insightful.
nevertheless, instead of invalidating the other relationship, it serves to highlight money's intrinsic characteristics: by distancing itself from specific definitions, money can adeptly navigate the complexities of both internal and external aspects, acting as a pivotal cultural and representational tool for each.
this highlights the unparalleled importance of money in the progression of practical thinking; it successfully minimizes the distinctive traits and narrow focus of various tangible forms.
the downfall in human conceptualizing lies in the higher concept's struggle to encompass a wider range of details, resulting in a gradual loss of specificity.
in ancient athens, during the emergence of monetary transactions in the fourth century, the wealthiest banker, pasion, began his career as a slave.
in turkey, armenians, a marginalized and often persecuted group, commonly engage in trade and money lending, akin to the moors in spain under similar circumstances.
in india, a comparable scenario unfolds where the socially oppressed yet striving parsees predominantly work as money changers or bankers, while in certain regions of southern india, the chetty, a mixed caste facing low status due to imperfect caste distinctions, control financial affairs and wealth.
likewise, the huguenots in france and the quakers in england diligently pursued wealth accumulation due to their vulnerable social positions.
it is nearly impossible to categorically exclude individuals from money pursuits as various avenues inevitably lead to it.
once the quakers had achieved full political equality, they chose to abstain from certain activities that conflicted with their beliefs.
they refrained from taking oaths, which barred them from holding public office.
they also rejected worldly pursuits like adornment, sports, and farming to avoid paying tithes.
consequently, to maintain some semblance of engagement with the external world, they concentrated on financial matters as their primary interest.
similarly, critiques have noted a lack of interest in the sciences, arts, and socializing among members of the herrenhuter community.
apart from religious matters, their main driving force seemed to be a drive for material acquisition.
in the herrenhuter and pietist groups, the emphasis on industry and avarice was seen as a reflection not of hypocrisy but of a declining cultural landscape, waning spiritual pursuits, and a focus on values associated with the material aspects of the world rather than higher ideals.
money is considered merely a tool on an absolute scale, lacking specific attributes derived from actual determinations.
it serves as the unconditional starting and ending point for all transactions.
thus, there are instances where certain groups are not excluded from the pursuit of goals, leading to a universal teleological structure applicable to the entire group.
historical records suggest that the spartans, who prohibited the pursuit of economic gains, exhibited signs of great avarice.
this illustrates how the desire for possessions can surface under circumstances where ownership lacks clarity and restrictions are less enforceable, as exemplified by the impractical distribution of wealth in the lycian system.
reports also indicate that in sparta, there was little disparity in the practical enjoyment of possessions between the rich and the poor over an extended period, with both groups living similarly without significant distinction in their lifestyles.
personal belongings prove more pragmatic to handle, but variations exist: for example, in medieval england, wool was notably practical as a form of currency utilized by parliament for tax allocations to the king and by the king to extract funds from merchants.
money represents the pinnacle of this spectrum.
the distinct attribute of money being void of specific determinacy, which rendered it the most favorable and least resistible revenue source for the marginalized jews, also made it the most straightforward and potent tool for exploiting them.
in relation to the medieval pogroms, instances where persecution targeted affluent jews in some cities and impoverished jews in others do not contradict, but rather underpin the increasing dominance of money.
this paragraph reflects on the significance of fashion, especially when it is imported, as a valued and influential form of social interaction.
just like how our eyes focus best on a distant point, social elements seem to converge effectively when not too close.
the stranger is particularly drawn to money for similar reasons that make it crucial for socially disadvantaged individuals – it offers opportunities not easily accessible to fully entitled persons or indigenous people through specific channels and personal relationships.
the depiction of strangers throwing money to native girls in front of the babylonian temple, leading them to prostitution, underscores this point.
additionally, there is a link between the sociological importance of strangers and money, where the primary interest in money manifests through trade rather than purely monetary transactions.
the prevalence of jews in the profession is underscored by the significant number of those from the diaspora who pursued this trade.
displaced communities, confined within distinct cultural boundaries, struggle to establish solid roots or secure independent roles in manufacturing.
consequently, they rely on intermediary commerce, which offers greater flexibility than primary production.
this is because the realm of trade can be expanded extensively through formal arrangements and can integrate individuals not directly affiliated with the group.
the stranger demands a higher risk premium for his business ventures and loans.
this concept applies not only to the jewish community but is ingrained in the fabric of commerce and finance, playing a crucial role in various aspects.
in this context, i will focus on examples from modern times.
cities like lyons and antwerp, home to major stock exchanges in the 16th century, owed their unique character to the presence of foreign traders who benefited from extensive trading freedoms.
these freedoms were closely tied to the financial transactions that defined these locations: a monetary economy and liberal trade policies share a profound connection, despite occasional historical disruptions and governmental errors.
the involvement of strangers in financial dealings serves as a clear illustration of this interconnectedness.
notably, the financial prominence of certain florentine families during the medici era stemmed from their exile or loss of political power at the hands of the medici ruling family.
to regain strength and significance, they relied on financial transactions as they were unable to engage in alternative businesses away from their homeland.
a closer examination shows how seemingly contradictory but concurrent events demonstrate this interconnectedness.
during the sixteenth century when antwerp was the prominent hub of global trade, its prominence was sustained by the presence of foreigners, including italians, spaniards, portuguese, british, and germans, who settled there and conducted trade.
the local populace of antwerp had a limited involvement in commerce, primarily serving as agents and bankers in financial transactions.
in this international community driven by global trade interests, the natives filled a role typically occupied by outsiders.
the key factor lies in the sociological dynamic between a large group and marginalized individuals.
due to their lack of direct ties to concrete interests, the latter gravitated towards financial dealings.
in the sixteenth century, the initial significant transactions made by modern bankers occurred overseas, regardless of the personal motivations of individual strangers in a group who opted for trading, particularly financial deals.
money transcended local limitations of most purposeful sequences, acting as the intermediary between any starting and ending points.
just as every facet of historical existence seeks an avenue to showcase its distinct qualities and strengths in the purest form, the early substantial modern capital, akin to the ambitious drive of young spirits, sought investments that best exemplified its comprehensive influence, utility, and impartiality.
in the analysis above, we have assumed a particular aspect of the sense of value that may easily obscure its importance to us.
money holds value for us because it enables us to acquire what we value, but it could also be argued that it is merely a means to an end.
it is not logically necessary for the value attributed to the ultimate goals of our actions to be transferred to the means themselves, which, devoid of any teleological context, would be detached from value.
this transfer of value through external associations manifests as a common feature of our thought processes, known as the psychological expansion of qualities.
when a series of objects, forces, or events contains a link that triggers specific subjective reactions in us, for example.
in essence, in any group of people and objects that are linked in some way, the inherent value of one element can influence and spread to the others that might not evoke the same sentiments individually.
since value is not dependent on the physical structure of items, but rather transcends it into a realm of its own, the process of valuation is not restricted by logical boundaries.
instead, it can freely expand beyond the objectively justified relationships between things.
alternatively, an object holds relative value when its perceived worth is influenced by achieving an absolute value.
the fluctuation in its value is evident when a better or more accessible alternative is found for the same purpose, resulting in a loss of value.
this distinction between absolute and relative value is not synonymous with the differentiation between objective and subjective value, as both can manifest in either form.
in this discussion, the terms "value" and "purpose" are used interchangeably, indicating they are facets of the same phenomenon.
the theoretical significance of an idea as a value aligns with its practical implication as a purpose from a volitional perspective.
the establishment of a goal is influenced by the character, mood, and interest of a person, whereas the path towards achieving it is determined by external circumstances.
the idea that we have freedom in deciding the initial step but are restricted in the subsequent actions is particularly evident in the realm of goal-setting.
however, this contrast, which reveals the complex interplay between our internal motivations and external realities, does not prevent a particular objective from transitioning between these two states.
the inherent spontaneity in defining the ultimate aim, coupled with the understanding that the methods used are mentally linked to the significance of the destination, allows these methods to gain a distinct independent value in our consciousness.
moreover, if this framework is accurate, it implies that addressing teleological progressions solely necessitates the existence of the initial energy unit, representing the original purpose.
the potent energy force endures in subsequent actions, driven throughout by the purpose right from the beginning, irrespective of the diminishing awareness of the purpose within the practical series.
the premature establishment of the ultimate goal, in its most extensive and fundamental aspect, is evidently not observed in everyday life occurrences but predominantly in the context of money.
nowhere else has an entity, deriving its value purely from its functionality as a medium and its capability to be transmuted into quantifiable values, captured such a profound and overwhelming psychological significance, evolving into an all-encompassing final objective steering our pragmatic awareness.
the insatiable pursuit of money intensifies as money acquires characteristics of a sheer instrument.
this signifies that the array of items attainable with money proliferates continuously, with objects becoming increasingly vulnerable to the authority of money, thereby rendering money intrinsically less valuable but more potent in comparison to the value of commodities.
the rising significance of money is contingent on its purification from all non-functional elements, consequently averting clashes with the distinct traits of objects.
the degree to which money assumes a paramount role in the perception of value hinges on the significant shift in economic focus from traditional production to industrial endeavors.
the disparity in viewpoints on money between contemporary individuals and ancient greeks arises mainly from its historical function primarily in consumption versus its contemporary pivotal role in production.
this discrepancy is crucial in understanding the overarching purpose of money as a key indicator of the entire economy.
in the past, the prevailing economic interest leaned heavily towards consumption rather than production; agrarian activities predominated, relying on straightforward and customary techniques that didn't demand heightened economic awareness like the evolving industrial sector.
consequently, attention was predominantly fixed on consumption rather than production in the economic landscape.
similarly, the evolution of labor practices mirrors this trend.
indigenous communities predominantly engaged in immediate consumption-driven work rather than accumulating possessions, which symbolize a progression towards further acquisition.
the formation of life encompasses a complex interplay of internal and external factors, making it challenging to pinpoint one as the sole fundamental aspect.
the nature of an agrarian economy is shaped by both its dependability, modest number of intermediary stages, and focus on consumption over production, as well as an orientation towards the essence of goods and a distaste for unpredictability and dynamism.
these attributes are like fragmented reflections of a shared historical foundation seen through diverse perspectives.
they are not easily identifiable or categorizable as they are part of a system where prioritization may not apply, rooted in interconnectedness and cyclical patterns essential despite lacking in comprehensive understanding.
the significance of money is paramount when considering the psychological aspect of how we strive towards achieving our goals.
it becomes evident when we closely examine the relationship between the means we employ and the ends we aim to achieve.
at times, we may deceive ourselves about the true motivations behind our actions, leading our desires to be directed towards objectives different from what we assume.
this prompts us to question whether there are underlying purposes that transcend our conscious awareness.
thus, we ponder where the boundaries of our quest for purpose lie.
if our pursuit of goals does not culminate in the last link we are consciously aware of, could this not suggest an endless continuation of this teleological sequence?
consequently, it seems imperative to remain discontent with any identified purpose that our actions are based on and to seek further rationale in a purpose that extends beyond the known one.
furthermore, no acquisition or achievement provides us with the ultimate fulfillment that is inherently connected to the notion of a definitive purpose.
in essence, the ultimate purpose seems to exist beyond the teleological progression, but it still maintains a connection to the end goal like earthly pathways that continually point towards it.
interestingly, no matter how far one wanders, the ultimate purpose never appears closer than it did initially.
the key issue is not about reaching this ultimate purpose but more about attributing any substance to its conceptualization.
the teleological progressions, aimed at achieving realizable objectives in the world, often halt not upon accomplishment but due to their inherent design.
rather than adhering to a fixed point representing their ultimate purpose, the proposal only puts forth a heuristic regulative principle suggesting that one ought not regard any singularly desired goal as conclusive, but rather keep open the potential for transitioning to a higher aim.
essentially, the ultimate purpose is more of a function or a suggestion.
seen abstractly, it is simply the compression of the idea that initially seemed to negate: that the course of human endeavor and assessment leads endlessly, and that any attained milestones along that journey must inevitably be seen as mere stepping stones in hindsight, no matter the apparent definitiveness prior to attainment.
thus, the promotion of means to the status of an ultimate purpose emerges as a less irrational concept.
while irrationality may persist in specific instances, the essence of the collective teleological progressions contrasts with that of confined phases.
justifying the notion of means becoming ends stems from the perspective that ultimately, ends themselves are merely means.
from the myriad of potential desires, self-directed actions, and gratifications, we arbitrarily designate a particular instance as the ultimate objective, rendering everything leading up to it simply instrumental.
even as we assign paramount importance to a specific endpoint, an impartial observer, and perhaps even we ourselves in hindsight, are compelled to introduce new, truly impactful objectives for the future, susceptible to a similar shift in significance.
amidst this intense interplay between the relative nature of our pursuits and the absolute notion of a final goal, the concept of money regains importance and is further elaborated upon.
acting as a representation and measure of the value of goods, while simultaneously serving as a mere tool and a neutral intermediary phase, money embodies the reality that the values we cherish and pursue are ultimately transient and instrumental in nature.
when money becomes the primary focus for an individual beyond what is considered acceptable in their social and economic environment, it can lead to the emergence of greed and avarice.
it is important to note that the perception of these traits depends on the prevailing economic conditions.
the level of importance placed on acquiring and hoarding money may vary across different contexts, being considered normal in one setting but excessive in another.
in advanced economies, the threshold for being labeled as greedy tends to be higher due to the dynamic nature of money circulation, whereas in less developed economies, this threshold is lower.
conversely, what may be seen as frugal behavior in a less monetized environment could be viewed as avaricious in a context where money flows more freely.
moreover, altruism can also manifest in one's devotion to god, where obeying his commandments stems from a deep love and surrender of the heart, akin to how we strive to fulfill the desires of a beloved individual out of genuine care for their happiness.
additionally, one may find motivation in upholding a world order that reflects a continuous alignment with the will of a supreme principle, where the relationship between god and humanity necessitates obedience as a genuine expression or inherent outcome, irrespective of personal consequences or the reciprocation of joy from god.
often, the awareness of purpose may not entirely align with objective reality and does not simply derive worth from psychological or epistemological interpretations of this impersonal drive.
this psychological truth interacts with various personal intentions and objectives in multifaceted ways.
the dedicated collector carefully hoards his treasures away from others, not deriving pleasure from them himself but vigilantly guarding them, thereby infusing his selfishness with a touch of transcendent appreciation.
normally, possessions are meant to be enjoyed, contrasting with items appreciated without a desire for ownership, such as the stars, or those valued for their inherent beauty, order, or significance, like the universe, which retain worth regardless of personal response.
for possessive individuals, a complex dynamic exists where ownership is crucial, yet its typical personal joys are eschewed in favor of perceiving it as a valuable and meaningful objective in itself.
ownership of land holds a distinct level of honor that sets it apart from other forms of possession, regardless of whether their practical benefits are equal or even greater for the owner.
this uniqueness explains why it has often been safeguarded through sacrifices that are typically reserved for ideals of utmost importance.
embedded within the concept of landed property is an intrinsic value that goes beyond mere utility; historically, being a landowner was considered inherently valuable, beyond just practical terms.
the attachment to land may carry spiritual significance, as seen during the peak of greek civilization.
during this era, selling land was deemed not only a betrayal to future generations but also disrespectful to ancestors, disrupting the family's continuity.
due to the limited supply of land, its symbolic representation of familial unity that transcends individuals and holds a sacred status was greatly valued.
the transformation of goods into a greater purpose that goes beyond mere enjoyment is most prominently illustrated in avarice and greed, aberrations within the pursuit of wealth that increasingly influence similar behaviors.
money, when elevated to an ultimate objective, undermines the intrinsic worth of even non-economic goods.
it vies not to coexist as one of life's ultimate objectives with wisdom, art, personal fulfilment, beauty, and love, but seeks supremacy, subjugating other pursuits as mere tools.
this shift in priorities is especially notable within the realm of economic goods.
insisting on regarding items as invaluable when they can be easily bought back with money may seem senseless.
the precise quantifiability of their monetary worth has stripped them of their unique individual importance and their relevance beyond the purely utilitarian economy.
the abstract nature of money, its detachment from specific personal gratification, fosters an objective fascination with money, appreciating its value that surpasses personal enjoyment.
for those consumed by avarice, money becomes not just a means to an end like other tools, but a final end in itself.
however, it is not even an end in terms of enjoyment.
the miser views money with a reverent distance, keeping it separate from their personal life as an object of almost fearful veneration.
the miser's affection for money is akin to the adoration one feels towards a cherished individual whose mere presence brings joy and contentment.
the miser values money not for any specific pleasure it can bring but for the possession and association with it.
by deliberately resisting using money for personal indulgence, the miser maintains a separation between himself and the money, yet constantly tries to bridge this gap by acknowledging his ownership of it.
the assurance of contentment is further reinforced by the unique connection between desire and achievement that money embodies, unlike other objects of our interest.
the personal outcomes of attaining a wish do not always perfectly mirror the initial sense of lacking that birthed the wish.
the acquisition of an item doesn't simply plug a gap left by desire, leaving everything unchanged.
this perspective is championed by schopenhauer, for whom every fulfillment is merely the removal of a negative void.
however, if one views contentment as a positive entity, then the realization of our desires is not solely the exchange of a negative state for a positive one, combined with a sense of joy; instead, the interplay between a wish and its fulfillment is highly intricate, as desires seldom encompass all facets of an object and its impact on us.
reality scarcely aligns with our desires as a potential category for possession aspiration.
it is a common saying that possessing something we desire often leads to disappointment, as we realize that the reality of having it fails to meet our expectations.
this awareness of the disparity between our desires and their fulfillment through possession is often devoid of any emotional content.
however, money stands out in this regard.
on one hand, it amplifies the gap between our wishes and the objects of our desire.
pursuing money alone inevitably leads to a vague and unsatisfying outcome, lacking a tangible relationship or meaningful connection due to its intangible nature.
when our aspirations are solely fixated on monetary wealth without a clear purpose, it inevitably results in profound disillusionment.
this disillusionment occurs when the fervently sought-after financial prosperity, once attained, exposes its true essence: money is a mere tool, incapable of sustaining its elevation to a higher purpose post-acquisition.
the discrepancy between desire and fulfillment is most prominent in situations where money is viewed as the ultimate goal, and greed has become a chronic trait.
in such cases, the pursuit is solely focused on possessing the desired object rather than deriving any satisfaction from it.
this unyielding focus on ownership results in a lack of disappointment when expectations are not met.
unlike other possessions that are anticipated to provide value upon acquisition, money, in the context of greed, is devoid of any inherent purpose beyond ownership.
money is considered a unique object in that its essence is transparent, leaving no hidden qualities, unlike other possessions.
it is an object devoid of distinctive qualities, rendering it incapable of harboring any unexpected or disappointing elements, unlike other more modest possessions.
those solely seeking monetary gain are shielded from such uncertainties.
the common tendency among people to value aspirations differently from their actual achievements culminates in an unparalleled avidity for wealth.
this insatiable desire only superficially fulfills its intended purpose, representing an illusory and unsustainable pursuit.
conversely, once one is truly content with possessing money, this inherent frailty dissipates.
when considering the correlation between desires and their fulfillment, money emerges as an inadequate yet fitting object of pursuit in the overall design of human fate.
the item being consumed is not actually the intended object, but rather a substitute lacking the desired quality of motivation.
the only conceivable reason for its consumption is to, at least, offset the expenditure.
money, in turn, serves another purpose, resulting in a sense of contentment and marking a peak in the teleological sequence.
this shift does not detract from the satisfaction, despite the failure to serve its subjective final purpose as an entity in itself.
this seemingly mundane yet notably peculiar occurrence exposes a unique teleological aspect of the value of money.
while often not evident in valuable items, making it seem bourgeois and insignificant, it represents the extreme manifestation of money's role as an intermediary that surpasses the actual final purpose.
in this scenario, not only is the authentic concept of saving money disregarded, much like in greed, but also the allure of power and the potential benefits of having wealth for the sake of owning it idly are discarded.
the item, which has lost any significance and intention in its consumption, is used in conditions that are uncomfortable and detrimental simply because the money spent has given it an absolute value.
here, not only is the purposeful action halted by money, but it also regresses into something perverse, as the purposeful valuation process is achieved through a method that lacks direct purpose.
in the realm of the money economy, the squanderer pertinent to the philosophy of money is not someone who recklessly gives away money in kind, but rather an individual who wastefully spends it on senseless purchases that do not align with their situation.
the joy derived from squandering is connected to the act of spending money on any item, distinct from the satisfaction gained from briefly enjoying possessions, the snobbery it may represent, or the excitement of obtaining and using goods.
this pleasure is specifically linked to the act of squandering itself, devoid of concern for the value or context of what is being spent.
this forms the core of greed and wastefulness, as both fundamentally disregard the ability to measure value, essential for setting limits and boundaries to goals, ultimately leading to the enjoyment of possessions.
it is essential to differentiate a true spendthrift from an epicurean or someone merely frivolous, as these traits may coexist within a person.
the spendthrift shows apathy towards possessions once acquired, experiencing fleeting and impermanent enjoyment without finding peace.
obtaining an object marks the end of its enjoyment for the spendthrift.
life mirrors a similar pattern for both the spendthrift and the miser: achieving a goal triggers an insatiable desire for more, indicating a perpetual search for satisfaction rooted in an ultimate purpose, which inherently rejects any clear purpose, focusing solely on the means and near-end moments.
the miserly individual embodies a more abstract form in comparison to the spendthrift.
the distinction lies in the individual's awareness of their intention, which diverges significantly from the ultimate goal.
the wasteful individual approaches objectives more closely as their pursuit of a rational aim concludes at a later point to possess it, treating it as the ultimate destination itself.
this parallels the conflicting outcomes despite the identical opposition in visible results and the absence of a specific guiding purpose.
the concurrent irrationality in both tendencies hints at a complex interaction between the two, contributing to why a person may exhibit both thriftiness and extravagance.
these traits may manifest in various areas of their life or in response to shifting emotions.
the ebb and flow of these emotions manifest as parsimony and lavishness, where the driving force remains constant, only varying in intensity each time.
luxury goods will always cater to demand without surpassing it.
for instance, precious metals serve numerous purposes, such as for crafting jewelry, highlighting their limitless utility.
this is due to their inherent extravagance.
the closer a commodity is to our essential needs for survival, the stronger the demand, yet it may be limited in quantity and reach saturation sooner.
conversely, commodities further removed from necessities are less influenced by natural demand and can endure without significant change in availability.
money differs from precious metals used in jewelry as it does not have to strike a balance between the insatiable craving for it and direct necessities.
instead, it now represents the fundamental requirements for human existence.
this intriguing duality of money, in relation to the desire for it, is demonstrated through detachment in the behaviors of greed and extravagance.
in both cases, money transforms into a pure object of desire.
these actions highlight the conflicting aspects of money, where it both fuels our conflicting psychological urges and simultaneously widens the scope in which they operate.
greed showcases a stagnation in material wealth, whereas extravagance displays a sense of fluidity and expansion.
poverty, alongside avarice and greed, manifests in its purest form within a specific stage of a money-driven economy.
in natural settings unaffected by money economies, where agricultural goods are not solely considered commodities or money values, extreme destitution is less prevalent.
historically, russia took pride in areas less influenced by money economies for having minimal personal poverty.
this phenomenon can be attributed to the easier access to essential needs without relying on money and the heightened sense of empathy towards poverty in such settings.
in monetary systems, compassionate sentiments toward poverty endure a more convoluted path before reaching their true target, often diminishing along the way.
when salvation of the soul is envisioned as the ultimate goal, various doctrines often view poverty as a positive and essential means that transcends mere utility to become an intrinsic and valuable concept.
this shift in perspective can occur at different points in the hierarchy of objectives and for various reasons.
initially, a detachment from worldly pleasures and concerns may lead to this view.
the burden of poverty is then effortlessly lifted from the soul without necessitating a deliberate focus on it.
it is plausible that the earliest christians behaved in this manner, not actively rejecting or striving against material wealth, but simply existing without attachment to it, akin to things imperceptible due to lacking the necessary receptivity.
hence, the intermittent communal practices in ancient christianity fundamentally differ from contemporary communist endeavors, as the former springs from indifference towards material possessions while the latter stems from a heightened embrace of them.
thus, in a situation where indifference to external factors is predominant in principle, this disposition, unlike money, can easily evolve into genuine hatred.
furthermore, the alluring nature of money exerts an even more pronounced influence on this disposition.
being readily available for use at any moment, money becomes a dangerous temptation during moments of weakness, as it facilitates all pursuits and presents itself in its most irresistible form to the soul.
this heightened peril stems from the fact that money, while existing solely as currency in our possession, is the most neutral and harmless entity in the world.
however, for ascetic sensibilities, it emerges as a tangible symbol of the deceptive devil concealed beneath an innocent and simplistic veneer.
consequently, the ultimate defense against both the devil and money lies in maintaining a distance from them and rejecting any association, no matter how innocent it may seem.
hence, the act of obtaining things through money, which levels out the process of acquisition without favoring any particular item, ultimately renders the objects more interchangeable.
this effect becomes even more pronounced as wealth accumulates, encompassing a wider variety of objects and diminishing their distinct values.
when items are beyond our purchasing power, they exert a unique fascination on us.
however, once we can easily buy them with money, their allure diminishes.
this loss of allure occurs not only because we possess and enjoy them, but also because acquiring them through a generic means erases their individual worth.
while this impact may be subtle at the level of individual instances, it is nevertheless present.
i have previously noted the importance of distinguishing between greed and avarice, as they often appear together but have distinct conceptual and psychological differences.
there are instances where these traits manifest independently.
the pursuit of money can be separate from the desire to hold onto it, even at levels where these inner drives remain within normal boundaries.
this separation is often due to the improper prioritization of money as a goal, lacking objective standards, which alters its perceived value as it transitions from being pursued to being used for other purposes.
the disparity between the value associated with money and the pursuit of acquiring it diminishes once it is obtained.
this inconsistency is also evident in the fact that, when acting as consumers, many individuals tend to be less frugal compared to when making business-related decisions.
this behavior might be the basis of a regulation in ancient jewish law which implies that people tend to be more cautious and meticulous in acquiring wealth than in using it.
according to this law, the defendant was always required to take an oath in disputes involving money, with only the grocer occasionally permitted, as mentioned in a passage of the talmud, to swear by his account book.
the varying approach to the management of money can be observed in historical figures such as louis xi and others, who were stringent in revenue collection but generous in expenditures.
generally, there is a notable link between the pace of gaining money and the speed of its disposal.
individuals like gamblers, fortune seekers, and individuals in certain social classes spend money more frivolously and freely than others.
i have highlighted this pivotal moment in the transition between the two segments of the teleological series because it unveils a fundamental aspect of money.
when money is viewed as the primary and most immediate goal in our minds, it possesses a certain quality.
it may be challenging to pinpoint this quality precisely, but the intensity of desire, the focus of our thoughts on it, and the intensity of associated hopes and emotions imbue it with a vibrant aura that makes the concept of money significant, regardless of the quantity.
all our practical aspirations progress in a similar manner.
while these goals remain unattained, they captivate us entirely, leading us to believe that even the smallest sum of money, as it symbolizes solely that particular object and idea, would bring us lasting contentment.
our focus is primarily on the quality of the object, with attention to quantity emerging as a secondary consideration once the quality has been experienced to a certain degree.
this shift in interest is especially evident in our perception of money, which becomes a significant factor in a modified way.
money, being a neutral tool with diverse practical uses, is primarily defined by its quantity rather than its other attributes.
when it comes to money, our main concern is not about its nature or purpose but simply the amount.
the true importance of money, and its effectiveness as a tool, is only fully appreciated when it is acquired and converted into tangible value.
it is then that the significance of its quantity in determining its power as a medium becomes apparent.
quantitative variations in the ownership of money lead to significant qualitative distinctions for the owners.
this fact, often overlooked due to its obviousness, becomes critical when individuals misunderstand money's sheer quantitative essence and mistakenly view its impact solely in mechanical terms.
an illustrative example reveals how different concentrations of money can dramatically influence its qualitative effects.
the circulation of small-denomination banknotes, predominantly held by individuals with limited incomes, distinctly differs from that of higher denominations.
those possessing smaller notes encounter difficulties redeeming them promptly compared to holders of larger notes.
in times of crisis, individuals with smaller notes might hastily demand redemption or part with them hastily at lower values.
below a certain limit, it is advised not to take risks, even if there is a possibility of gaining a large sum with minimal chances of loss.
in this scenario, objective factors typically used to assess the reasonableness of risks become irrelevant.
the use of money values can lead individuals to misinterpret this economic principle by breaking down values into smaller units, enticing those with limited resources to take risks that they should actually avoid.
an example of this can be seen in the issuance of gold shares valued at one pound by mining companies in the transvaal and western australia.
despite their low value and high potential for profit, these shares have been purchased by individuals not normally involved in stock market dealings.
a similar situation arises in the italian lottery.
this scenario demonstrates how the nature of money can significantly change based on variations in its quantity, leading to diverse qualitative implications for monetary issues.
the value and significance of a specific amount of money differ based on whether it falls below or above a certain threshold, primarily determined by the individual's overall financial resources.
adjustments in the amount of money in circulation result in the emergence of novel characteristics and implications.
ultimately, this concept aligns with a broad principle governing the behavior of various systems, predominantly evidenced in the field of psychology.
an escalation in the quantity of factors acting as causes does not invariably lead to a commensurate increase in their effects.
in fact, while enhancing a cause may correlatively augment the associated outcome at a certain level, a significantly greater input becomes necessary to achieve a similar impact at a higher level.
for instance, it is common to observe how the initial working capital generating a specific return within an emerging domain of investment necessitates substantial expansion over time to sustain the same level of return.
it is a common and significant everyday occurrence that almost all stimuli that bring pleasure can initially result in an increase in pleasurable sensations, but eventually, they can lead to their cessation or even to a feeling of discomfort.
the discrepancy between external causal stimuli and the internal sensation they provoke is further demonstrated in the following manner.
objects with minimal economic value, though still possessing value, often do not motivate us to act in ways that align with their economic worth.
for instance, certain items like stamps may hold value in terms of money, yet this value is disregarded and does not influence how we interact with them.
we may anticipate responses from distant individuals to whom we wouldn't think of requesting payment, and who themselves might not have any stake in the matter.
if the recipient holds a similar social standing, we might feel hesitant to include a stamp for their reply.
for example, specific colors or color combinations may be vivid but fail to evoke aesthetic pleasure when not displayed in a space of substantial size.
in such cases, they function merely as sensory stimuli rather than eliciting aesthetic appreciation.
similarly, a historical threshold exists, delineating the stark contrast between individual efforts and their broader historical impacts.
numerous indian ascetics shared teachings akin to gotama's, yet only he achieved the status of buddha.
many jewish teachers delivered sermons similar to jesus', yet he uniquely shaped world history.
this disparity in impact is prevalent across various contexts, underscoring the pivotal role of influential personalities who transcend historical significance thresholds, unlike their lesser-known counterparts who fade into obscurity.
beyond this realm, a higher threshold exists - that of philosophical consciousness.
the varying thresholds of awareness for pleasure and pain sensations present here pose challenges that resist analysis.
recent physiological studies have revealed significant differences in pain sensitivity among nerves in different body parts.
some nerves have thresholds that are six hundred times higher than others, further complicated by the lack of a consistent relationship in sensitivity to pressure at the same location.
comparing thresholds for diverse emotional and non-sensory experiences is complicated due to their heterogeneous nature, making quantitative comparisons unlike those of mechanical or electrical stimuli on sensory nerves.
all connections formed based on other aspects of life possess a degree of stability due to their consistent connection to the individual.
these relationships can resist changes until significant personal growth occurs.
in contrast, money, lacking inherent qualities or ties to a specific personality, can easily transition between individuals without internal resistance.
therefore, the circumstances and contexts related to money can readily adapt to any fluctuations.
for our current discussion, the ability to accumulate money, highlighting its purely quantitative nature, allows it to significantly impact the specific experiences of life.
commonly linked with money are pivotal events that elucidate its fundamental nature, including unearned gains, being just one of its defining traits.
the importance of this concept to our understanding can be clarified by referring to a tenet in marginal utility theory.
according to this theory, each unit within a supply of goods is assigned the value of the least valuable unit, typically utilized for the least essential purpose.
this is because in the event of the loss of any unit, the remaining units would naturally cater to more critical needs, leaving only the least essential ones unmet.
therefore, the unit that would need to be foregone is deemed the least critical.
consequently, the value of a supply of goods is not determined by the various potential uses for the goods, but rather by the least valuable unit's use, multiplied by the total number of units within the supply.
one acknowledged exception to this theory is when a collection of goods forms a unified whole, providing a unique utility effect that surpasses the sum of the individual parts.
take, for example, the impact of a forest, believed to influence climate, weather, soil fertility, public health, and the stability of the nation's wealth.
the forest, viewed holistically, holds value that transcends calculating the utility of separate trees.
similarly, the worth of an army is not determined by the marginal utility of each soldier, nor can the value of a river be assessed by the marginal utility of a single drop of water.
this distinction applies to an individual's possessions as well.
possessing one million marks as an individual not only grants a distinctive status and social standing that is vastly different from the owner of a mere thousand marks.
the subjective importance of this sum extends beyond its corresponding value in smaller increments.
the objective worth of one million marks is not simply a calculation based on the marginal utility of its parts at a thousand marks each; rather, it represents a unified entity akin to the value of a living being where its worth as a whole transcends the sum of its individual components.
in a previous discussion, it was emphasized that regardless of the number of coins involved, the monetary value of an object remains a singular entity.
hence, one million marks, though comprising multiple units, essentially function as an interconnected whole.
the inherent formlessness of money itself is at the core of the conflict between artistic inclinations and financial concerns.
aesthetic priorities often emphasize pure form, with design historically regarded as the paramount aesthetic aspect across various art forms due to its ability to remain consistent regardless of the material used.
however, it is now recognized as a fallacy, and it is essential to acknowledge that the physical size of an artwork significantly impacts its aesthetic value.
even the slightest alteration in dimensions can greatly influence its aesthetic impact, although the essence of aesthetic value still resides in the form itself, such as the interplay between its elements.
despite this, it is evident that the realization and materialization of art also play a crucial role in shaping its character and impact.
interestingly, while many proverbs touch on the subject of money, unlike the vast array of folk songs, only a handful seem to address its overwhelming significance.
avoiding unnecessary repetition doesn't add value to the content.
essentially, focusing our assessments on form leads to a disregard for its quantitative aspects, when in fact, its lack of form is what highlights its importance for determining value.
although the connection between low and high denominations of currency is well understood, there are situations where valuable items like boats or houses cannot be purchased using numerous low-denomination pieces, necessitating the use of a specific high-ranking currency.
this requirement for a particular quality of currency is also seen in transactions involving women, where no amount of other types of money can serve as a substitute.
conversely, in certain regions, gold is reserved for acquiring expensive items, not for buying bulk goods of low value.
these phenomena differ from the gold standard, where gold is demanded for payments exceeding a certain threshold, and other metals are acceptable for smaller transactions.
in the realm of historical psychology, money inherently symbolizes a cognitive trend prevalent in modern science: the conversion of qualitative aspects into quantitative ones.
this concept parallels the neutral mediums responsible for our perception of color and sound.
quantitative variations in these mediums determine whether we interpret qualitative differences as green or violet, or identify notes as a contra a or a high c.
in the fragmented and accidental influence of objective reality on our consciousness, everything is organized based on quantity and numerical value, with the qualitative distinctions in our subjective responses aligning quantitatively with their objective equivalents.
it is possible that the vast array of substances, evident in their chemical interactions, are essentially diverse vibrations of the same fundamental material.
whenever mathematical science delves into specific materials, configurations, or causes of movement, it aims to represent structures and progressions through purely quantitative expressions.
when an individual maintains a significant level of prominence and qualitative uniqueness, it is seen as a remarkably fortunate inheritance, representing a culmination of energies and achievements of humanity.
even in a culture that emphasizes individualism, this democratic inclination remains potent and evolves into a broader worldview, albeit at the expense of undervaluing the inner essence of the soul.
this perspective argues that the greatest virtues are interwoven into everyday life and its mundane moments rather than in heroic attitudes or catastrophic events, which are often deemed arbitrary and shallow.
while we may all experience intense emotions and extraordinary flights of imagination, their ultimate worth is determined by their significance during those quiet, unassuming hours when our true selves truly emerge.
in essence, despite initial impressions and valid criticism, modern times exhibit a prevailing shift toward empiricism, thereby revealing a fundamental connection to modern democracy in both structure and attitude.
empiricism supersedes singular visionary or rational concepts with a multitude of observations, prioritizing quantity over quality of individual instances.
this methodological approach aligns with psychological sensualism's view that our highest reasoning capacities are essentially heightened collections of ordinary sensory components.
interest in quantity is only meaningful when considered alongside what and how, as it is merely an abstract concept on its own.
it plays a fundamental role in shaping our intellectual capacity and serves as a vessel for our appreciation of qualities.
while a balance between both types of interests contributes to a rich tapestry, focusing solely on one, though not rational, holds significant psychological implications in defining periods, individuals, and mental states.
nietzsche's divergence from socialist perspectives lies in his belief that the essence of humanity lies in its quality alone, with the value of an era being determined by a singular exemplary standard.
in contrast, socialism places importance on the widespread presence of desirable conditions and values.
the previously mentioned examples of the contemporary quantitative trend clearly delineate two distinct types.
primarily, the objective substances and events that form the foundation for qualitatively unique subjective interpretations are themselves solely distinguished by quantity.
secondly, the accumulation of elements and forces alone gives rise to subjective occurrences that differ qualitatively and with regard to value perspectives from those that stem from quantitative factors.
money serves as a prime example, representation, or emblem of the modern emphasis on the quantitative aspect.
the increasing availability of commodities for monetary exchange, along with money's transformation into a central and ultimate value, results in items being evaluated primarily based on their monetary cost.
the perceived value of objects is merely dependent on their monetary price, with their quality of value being perceived as directly proportional to their price in monetary terms.
the high or low monetary value of these objects yields two distinct outcomes.
in the scenario where a serf generates goods solely to cover their owed payment to the manor's lord, the latter shows no concern for the overall output.
this becomes crucial when dealing with fractional payments, leading to monitoring, coercion, and oppression.
the establishment of fixed payments based on an absolute rather than a relative amount signifies a shift towards monetary transactions.
essentially, at this stage, achieving full freedom and liberation from obligations for individuals may seem plausible, as the focus is on receiving a set payment, regardless of how it is obtained.
however, in practical terms, this payment can only be acquired by the obligated party through their own efforts, forming the basis of their relationship.
due to these reasons, it has been somewhat considered a significant declaration of personal freedom within civil law.
under classical roman law, it was stated that if payment in kind was refused, then the obligation could be settled using money.
this concept essentially granted individuals the option to satisfy personal duties through monetary means, thus affording them the ability to buy themselves out of such obligations.
for instance, when a feudal lord demanded certain goods like beer, poultry, or honey from a serf, it determined the serf's activities.
however, if the lord instead requested a monetary payment, the serf was liberated as they could choose the activities they preferred, like beekeeping or raising cattle.
in the context of personal labor services, a similar principle applied with the right to designate a substitute, whereby the other party had to accept the replacement, unless their capabilities were questioned.
the initial phase in objectifying and depersonalizing this duty occurs when it is precisely outlined.
consequently, even in early times, there are clear specifications detailing the number of knights and attendants to be hosted, the quantity of horses and dogs allowed to join them, and the provisions of bread, wine, fish, tableware, and table linens that must be supplied.
however, when it came to the actual provision of accommodation and meals, the boundaries of the services offered likely became blurred, intertwining with personal connections.
a more advanced stage is evident when payments in kind are made without the need for lodging.
in such instances, quantifying the supplies becomes much more exact compared to situations where hosting and catering to individual preferences are necessary.
schopenhauer believes that the suffering and joy each individual experiences are predetermined by their inherent nature, and this predetermined amount cannot be exceeded or ignored.
he argues that external circumstances merely alter the way we perceive this unchangeable level of happiness and sorrow.
when applying this outlook on a broader scale to humanity, it appears that all efforts for happiness, material progress, and competition for possessions are simply a reshuffling of existing values without altering the total sum of happiness and sorrow.
therefore, any changes in wealth distribution are essentially about one person acquiring what another has relinquished, whether willingly or not.
this conservation of value aligns with a pessimistic and passive view of life, suggesting that the inability to generate wholly new values underscores the importance of preserving existing ones.
there are two ways to improve this situation.
the most immediate one is to shift the focus of the conflict from fighting against other people to battling against nature.
by tapping into additional resources and forces from nature for human benefit, competition for existing resources is decreased.
it's fortunate that the principle of conserving material and energy applies only to the overall sum of nature and not to the specific portion that humans can utilize through intentional actions.
this smaller portion can be expanded indefinitely by converting more materials and forces into forms that serve our needs, essentially by incorporating them.
advancements in technology show us how to extract even more utility from resources, including those that seem fully utilized.
it is indeed profoundly significant that what distinguishes humans from lower animal species at both a factual and psychological level is their ability for objective contemplation.
this involves setting aside ego-driven impulses and biases in favor of pure objectivity.
this capacity plays a crucial role in fostering the most noble and uplifting outcomes in human history: the creation of a world where conflict and oppression are minimized, and where the pursuit and enjoyment of values are not limited to one individual but can be shared by others.
this challenge, addressed effectively in an objective world, is approaching a solution in a more functional manner.
in transactions where services or benefits are traded for money, one participant obtains a desired item while the other acquires something generally sought after.
due to its universal utility and enduring appeal, every transaction is, in essence, mutually beneficial.
the recipient of the item will only accept it if it fulfills a current need, while the receiver of money values its versatility for future use.
money transactions enhance satisfaction for both parties, unlike bartering, where often only one party is genuinely interested in the item being exchanged.
therefore, exchanging goods and services for money represents the most effective solution to the significant cultural issue stemming from the one-sided benefit of trading possessions.
this solution aims to enhance the inherent objective value by transforming it into a greater amount of subjective value through changes in ownership.
this process, in conjunction with the initial value creation, is evidently a crucial aspect of societal benefit within the broader human context - ensuring the maximum release of the latent value ingrained in the way we shape our life's contents.
observing money's role in facilitating this objective underscores how exchange, embodied in money, is pivotal as the primary social mechanism for addressing this cultural challenge.
it can be argued that changes in the distribution of wealth within a group, despite appearing as mere shifts in form, do not alter its overall significance.
this transformation yields a variety of outcomes both economically and in terms of overall wealth.
the distinctions are not solely quantitative but also qualitative, touching upon the core issues at hand and reverting back to the matter of quantity.
when the same commodity is held by different individuals, it usually results in a quantitative discrepancy in monetary returns.
conversely, when an equivalent sum of money is in the hands of different individuals, it signifies a qualitative shift in its impact on objectives.
the prevalence of social expediency in modern society explains why wealth tends to circulate more quickly among families compared to non-money economies.
money naturally gravitates towards more profitable opportunities, which is particularly evident due to the passive and secure nature of owning money.
money ownership allows for tranquil enjoyment compared to other forms of property, with minimal economic risk and maximum profitability potential.
the ease of transferring money ownership results in efficient economic utility and broadens the scope for achieving its utmost importance through distribution.
as technology becomes increasingly complex, people's lives and activities become more reliant on external conditions.
this heightened interdependence leads to a greater reliance on a growing number of individuals who are mostly valued based on their roles as holders of capital and providers of resources.
their personal characteristics beyond these functions are of little significance in this context.
an individual's personality can be a blend of various qualities, even ones that seem contradictory, creating a diverse range of traits in different people.
it is the fusion of multiple characteristics into a coherent whole that forms a unique personality, giving each trait a personal touch.
rather than a single trait defining a person, it is the combination of traits that shapes them.
understanding the complexity of a person's soul involves breaking it into separate aspects, which when reassembled, reveal their distinct personality.
both phenomena stem from a common origin and represent contrasting aspects of a single process: the contemporary specialization of work allows for a rise in interdependencies while simultaneously leading individual personalities to be overshadowed by their roles.
this results in only one aspect of individuals being emphasized, neglecting all other facets that together form a complete personality.
should this trend be fully realized, the resulting societal structure would share striking similarities with socialism, possibly leaning towards an extreme form of state socialism.
hence, human activities would be elevated far beyond an individual's true psychological essence, resembling the realm of platonic ideals high above the tangible world.
evidences of such constructs are not uncommon: at times, a role within the division of labor appears as an independent, fictitious construct, causing those in the role to lose their distinctive qualities and merely fulfill duties without fully engaging their personality in the rigidly defined tasks.
being viewed solely as a function holder strips away individual relevance, akin to a hotel guest passing through a room.
in such a societal framework taken to its extreme, individuals would become perpetually reliant; their roles would be so narrowly defined that they would depend on others' interventions for completion, with personal abilities secondary to an externally organized work system shaped by completely objective criteria.
in earlier times, individuals managed their few dependencies through close personal relationships that were often irreplaceable.
in contrast, the modern compensation for our numerous dependencies is the ability to detach emotionally from others and the freedom to alter those connections at will.
our reliance on society as a whole has increased due to our complex needs and specialized skills, surpassing that of primitive societies who functioned within small, tight-knit groups.
however, we have become remarkably self-sufficient from specific individuals within society.
their importance to us has shifted to the impartial utility of their contributions, which could just as easily be fulfilled by many others who we are connected to solely through transactions based on monetary value.
this signifies a significantly higher level of autonomy for the vassal in comparison with the serf, despite their duties being essentially equivalent.
the crucial distinction lies not in the bond itself, but in being tied to a specific individual master, which truly contradicts freedom.
even contemporary domestic workers' status is distinguished by the employers' ability to select based on references and personal recommendations, while the worker lacks the opportunity and criteria to make similar choices.
it is only in recent times that the shortage of domestic workers in major cities has occasionally allowed individuals to decline a position for unpredictable reasons.
both parties view this as a significant advancement towards the autonomy of domestic workers, even though the actual workload remains as burdensome as before.
examining a different scenario but within the same context, we could argue that if a particular anabaptist sect were to support polygamy and frequent changing of wives by claiming that it disrupts the internal dependency or female role, it would be like a distorted representation of a fundamentally valid observation.
our general state always comprises a combination of duty and freedom, where one aspect is more prevalent in substance within a certain aspect of life, while the other is more apparent in its structure.
the limitations imposed by a specific commitment feel less suffocating when we have the ability to select the objective, ideal, or personal authorities we adhere to without diminishing our level of dependence.
a similar progression can also be observed among wage laborers in a monetary system.
considering the harshness and compelled nature of their work, it may seem as though wage laborers are merely veiled slaves.
afterwards, we will explore how their status as servants to the objective production process could be seen as a transitional phase towards their liberation.
on a personal level, their connection to individual employers has grown more tenuous compared to earlier labor structures.
although workers are still bound to their jobs similar to how peasants are tied to their land, the frequent turnover of employers in a money-driven economy and the option to select and switch employers made possible by wage payments offer a new level of freedom within their reliance.
unlike slaves, industrial laborers have the freedom to change employers at will, without facing the same dire consequences as a slave attempting to escape a master.
by removing the burden of irreversible dependency on a specific master, the worker is gradually moving towards personal freedom despite their current constraints.
the importance of maintaining slaves and serfs in good working condition was a personal concern for both the slave-owner and the lord of the manor, as it served their own interests due to their authority and responsibilities towards them.
in contrast, the relationship between a capitalist and a wage laborer lacks this intrinsic obligation, and even when present, it is often overlooked.
the liberation of the laborer necessitates a corresponding release of the employer from the benefits derived from bonded labor.
the laborer's current hardships or instability reflect the evolving process of liberation that commences with breaking individual dependency.
social freedom, much like its absence, is fundamentally a connection between individuals.
the expansion of a society signifies a shift from a state of stability and constancy to one of variability and interchangeability among individuals.
true freedom begins with emancipation from the authority of specific individuals.
while the solitary pioneer in the wilderness of germany or america is self-reliant, the urban populace today are independent in a more active sense, although they rely on numerous suppliers, workers, and collaborators, without whom they would struggle.
their associations with others are purely transactional, often involving money.
therefore, urban residents are not reliant on particular persons, but rather on their commodified services, which can be provided by any interchangeable individual.
because money serves as a symbolic representation of abstract group forces, the relationship between individuals and the group is tightly bound by monetary transactions.
this connection mirrors how individuals relate to objects due to the pervasive influence of money.
in a money-driven economy, the abundance of commodities leads to devaluation and a loss of significance in individual objects, rendering them almost worthless.
however, the broader category of objects maintains its importance as our dependence on a multitude of goods increases.
while a specific object may have little value on its own, such as a single pin, it becomes indispensable in modern society.
similarly, the importance of money grows in tandem with this trend, reflecting our deepening reliance on material possessions.
the initial emergence of satire, biography, and drama showcased a naturalistic style that emphasized the significance of the individual.
this coincided with the rise of a money-based economy, which revealed its societal impact.
even during the pinnacle of greek civilization, there was an objective perspective on the world that aligned closely with natural laws.
this perspective also included a strong emphasis on personal freedom and self-determination.
the greeks were slightly behind in formalizing the ideas of freedom and self in theory, which reflected in their less stringent theories of nature.
despite the challenges metaphysics faced in reconciling objective reality with individual freedom, the development of these aspects of culture progressed in parallel.
it seemed that emphasizing one necessitated a similar emphasis on the other to maintain a balanced inner life.
the interdependence among individuals becomes apparent only as the economy reaches its maximum capacity, complexity, and internal interactions.
by removing personal elements, individuals are encouraged to rely on their own capabilities and to appreciate their freedom more positively than they would in the absence of relationships.
money symbolizes this state well as it facilitates connections between people while maintaining personal boundaries; it serves as a precise gauge of material progress yet falls short in capturing individual nuances and personal aspects.
for perceptive minds, the limitations of objective dependencies that money represents serve as a backdrop that highlights the emergence of distinct personalities and their freedom.
certainly, epistemology needs to differentiate between the enduring natural law and the transient aggregate of its manifestations.
its purpose in the realm of cognition seems to revolve around discerning each conceivable manifestation.
the essential entity must be delineated from the personal interpretations through which it is mirrored.
yet, its significance mainly lies in unambiguously specifying every potential perception of the entity.
while the ethical standard surpasses specific actions to which it may apply positively or negatively, its primary purpose remains evaluating any such action.
if there were no actions at all to which it pertained, its actual significance would dwindle to nothing.
in essence, the class of these core elements and principles diffuses from each distinct scenario and the cumulative total of these scenarios, irrespective of their scale.
however, its utter sum is precisely equivalent to its absolute value.
ownership, in its subjective sense, can vary based on the nature of the object possessed.
money stands out as an exception as it is less influenced by this factor.
possessing and utilizing items other than money relies on various factors and efforts.
consequently, ownership plays a significant role in determining the behavior and quality of the owner.
for instance, individuals who own property or businesses but delegate responsibilities become less autonomous, shifting their focus to investments like art collections or horse farms.
this shift not only dictates how they spend their time but also implies specific skills and predispositions.
each possession carries a unique form of ownership that extends beyond mere legal ownership.
it is important to acknowledge the distinct role that money plays in specific monetary transactions.
rather than solely serving as a medium of exchange, money can also function as the central focus, the primary object of a transaction unto itself.
in purely bilateral financial operations, money becomes an end in itself, not only setting aside its function as a tool but also establishing itself as the self-sufficient core of interest.
this distinct monetary dynamic gives rise to its unique norms, autonomous qualities, and specific techniques.
in situations where money displays its individual characteristics and qualities, it allows for a more direct expression of personality in its management compared to when it merely serves as a neutral means to achieve different objectives.
the crucial aspect in such instances is that handling money necessitates a precise and sophisticated technique.
this specialized technique is essential for individuals to cultivate their unique style.
it is only when a particular category of phenomena appears in abundance, requiring a distinct technique to contend with them effectively, that the material becomes flexible enough for individuals to articulate their personal style while managing it.
once the individual's ability to enforce exclusive ownership wanes, others can access what was previously their property, leading to its swift transfer to a new owner.
this cycle continues, with ownership passing to whoever can assert authority over the object.
in societies governed by laws, personal strength becomes irrelevant because collective norms ensure the permanence of ownership and the prevention of unauthorized access.
hence, property is defined as the socially endorsed right to enjoy something exclusively.
this definition is further reinforced when property is valued in monetary terms.
if an individual possesses money, the constitution of the community ensures that not only does he have access to that money, but also to a multitude of other goods and services.
unlike owning a specific object with limited uses dictated by its nature, owning money implies the potential to obtain a wide range of items.
while public order can protect the rights associated with different possessions based on their intrinsic qualities, like land for farming or a forest for logging, the act of minting money ensures that the money owner can exchange it for various commodities such as grain, wood, or game.
these individual differences revolve around inclinations toward spending, whether one prefers making substantial one-time purchases or numerous smaller transactions, how receiving a large sum of money influences their behavior leading to either wastefulness or increased frugality.
additionally, the passage explores tendencies to overspend impulsively, where each purchase acts as a catalyst for the next one, as opposed to experiencing internal resistance from each transaction, making justified purchases reluctantly.
these characteristics are deeply ingrained in individual personalities and are most evident within a monetary framework.
it is emphasized that these financial behaviors represent a spectrum of attitudes, unlike the diverse personalities that exhibit varying connections with objects and individuals.
the practical impact of artists, officials, preachers, teachers, and scholars is evaluated based on an objective standard and can bring personal satisfaction to the individual based on these benchmarks.
however, the economic prosperity tied to these roles can often diverge from their original ideals.
while financial success may sometimes overshadow the fundamental ideals, particularly for those more attuned to sensitivity and idealism, it can serve as a form of solace or compensation, addressing any sense of inadequacy in achieving their primary goals.
alternatively, it may provide a temporary diversion, ultimately rejuvenating efforts towards the main objective.
if their endeavors fail, they lack the solace, no matter how small, of achieving a tangible secondary victory.
this success, usually in the form of earned money, significantly eases their pursuit of significance.
by clearly indicating that the accomplishment holds value for others, even if it falls short of personal or ultimate objectives, money serves as a practical substitute for a major success.
its concrete nature and quantitative measure offer support and mental relief from the uncertainties of subjective life values, especially during times of transition.
moreover, the detachment of money from abstract ideals shields sensitive individuals from disturbing conflicts in their value system.
thus, freedom can be understood as an internal delegation of tasks, involving a mutual separation and diversification of impulses, interests, and capabilities.
a person is considered free when their different individual abilities grow and function independently towards their unique objectives and standards.
this concept encompasses the conventional notion of freedom from external constraints.
upon closer examination, our experience of a lack of freedom essentially signifies that the inner resilience needed to resist it, the realm of the soul dedicated to an imposed purpose, overlaps with other energies and interests that might otherwise have been spent on other pursuits or joys; only when it interferes with our activities or desirable pleasures do we perceive a forced deprivation as a restriction of freedom.
we would not perceive work assigned to us as an infringement on our freedom unless it disrupted or suppressed other normal or sought-after sensual energies.
achieving complete separation of individual psychic sequences is unattainable as there are necessary connections that present man as a unified entity amid his diverse aspects and behaviors.
total differentiation or liberty within an inner series remains a theoretical impossibility.
the most that can be achieved is reducing the entanglements and constraints to affect fewer specific points of the series over time.
when one series inevitably intersects with another psychic realm, it retains the most autonomy by being generally linked to this realm rather than each of its components.
for instance, intelligence and will are closely intertwined, with intelligence's profound insights and accomplishments relying on the vigorous vitality of the will.
however, if the driving will carries distinct characteristics or particular content, the autonomy and consistency of intelligence are compromised.
intelligence thrives when harmonized with a broad vitality of existence.
however, the intensification of emotions to their fullest extent and their ability to endure might face obstacles if attention is narrowly focused on only one aspect of the other person.
instead, it is when the entirety of the beloved's image shapes one's awareness of them, balancing out each specific trait they possess, that a foundation is laid for love to flourish genuinely and robustly, and to flow naturally.
the inevitable merging of mental energies hinders the individual progress of those energies when they are associated not with a particular facet or phase of the other person, but with their fundamental nature.
it is through this approach that a healthy distance can be achieved, allowing both parties to evolve independently.
the case under consideration here falls within the same category.
the intellectual aspects of the psychic process are intertwined with economic interests, making it challenging to entirely separate the two due to their fundamental nature, which applies not just in isolated instances but within the broader scope of individual and societal contexts.
this interconnection may limit the complete autonomy and liberty of intellectual work, particularly when the economic tie is not specific to a particular economic entity.
the extent to which economic interests can be aligned solely with overarching general interests can create a distance from intellectual pursuits that would not be feasible if the economic focus was on a specific object necessitating particular attention.
traditionally, the most favorable form of property ownership has been land, characterized by its management style, direct usefulness of its yields, and consistent marketability, allowing for a certain level of intellectual engagement without disruption.
issues such as tariff policies, labor protection, association rights, promotion of wholesale or retail trade, and trade regulations, including residency requirements and observance of the sabbath, will evoke varied and often conflicting responses within this intricate framework.
the situation also extends to major corporations and vast land holdings, which share a similar economic status but diverge significantly in their political affiliations.
the amalgamation of classes solely based on income levels loses its real political relevance.
as a result, the state increasingly relies on solutions that accommodate the wide array of interests and inclinations.
this evolution may encounter resistance or be obscured by numerous opposing influences.
by fully retracing back to the ego, it would achieve unity, coherence, and tangibility, which provide significance and worth to what we define as objectivity.
just as in this scenario, the subject surpasses its opposition to the object through complete absorption and transcendence, likewise, in the opposite scenario, the opposition is defeated as objective conduct assimilates all subjectivity without any remnants for the opposition to persist.
money, whether obtained through mortgages, agricultural yields, or land itself, facilitates transactions between landowners and their properties.
it fosters independence from the unique qualities of the land, thereby promoting greater equality among the nobility and other social classes.
the concept of equal rights that prevailed in greek democracies further severs the connection between ownership and social status.
in early german history, land ownership was not an isolated possession but rather a reflection of an individual's affiliation with their local community.
the significance and influence of an individual were not determined by land ownership; instead, possessing specific importance led to the acquisition of particular parcels of land.
this shift resulted in the division of land and its integration into the dynamic sphere of economic activities.
as this trend was eventually halted by the inherent stability of the land, money emerged as a replacement, becoming the most impersonal economic medium.
money proved to be the ideal means to symbolize the separation between existence and possession that was already influencing land ownership.
subsequently, a similar pattern emerged from a different perspective and social stratum in the thirteenth century.
during this era, the rural population, especially in the eastern regions of germany colonized by emancipated peasants closely linked to the developed monetary system, enjoyed a significant degree of autonomy.
however, this autonomy was short-lived as a swift backlash ensued: the feudal system expanded, particularly beyond the elbe river, successfully aiming to tether the peasants to the land.
it is likely that the evolution of private property primarily focused on acquiring tools of labor, such as weapons, rather than the actual produce of labor.
tools are considered crucial as they directly extend our natural limbs, and the resistance encountered when using tools is typically felt at the tip of the tool.
the sense of ownership over tools is more profound compared to other possessions because they enhance one's ability to act.
consequently, tools are integrated into one's identity almost as closely as the body itself.
this interpretation of property highlights how the philosophical concepts of idealism and freedom are enriched by the notion that objects become part of the self, just as the self becomes connected to objects.
the awareness of oneself has expanded beyond its initial limitations and has now intertwined with items that are not directly related to it.
this clearly demonstrates that the concept of ownership essentially signifies the expansion of one's identity onto objects and, by controlling them, the broadening of its sphere of control.
this occurrence clarifies the peculiar situation where, at times, an individual's entire possessions seem to equate the entirety of their character.
in medieval france, there existed a particular group of serfs who, by relinquishing all their belongings to the lord, were entitled to attain freedom as per legal rights.
the significance of this quality for the market is not solely internal to the state, brewery, mine, or bank itself, but in its interconnection with all other stocks and their market conditions.
thus, external events such as major insolvencies in argentina causing a drop in the price of chinese bonds do not inherently impact the security of those bonds.
the value of these stocks, despite their external stability, is influenced by the broader market dynamics, where fluctuations can potentially reduce the profitability of their returns.
apart from the fluctuations in the stock market, which involve combining a single object with others and are objectively generated, there is a significant factor originating within speculation itself.
the bets placed on the future quoted price of a stock play a major role in determining that price.
for example, when a prominent financial group shows interest in a stock for reasons unrelated to its quality, the quoted price tends to rise.
conversely, a bearish group can manipulate the price downward.
in this scenario, the true value of the object seems less relevant compared to the influence of market forces, which inflate prices based on associations rather than inherent worth.
the link between the actual and perceived value of an object through trading has become increasingly uncertain.
this demonstrates the remarkable adaptability of the value system, where the objects have become disconnected from their true essence by adopting a monetary form.
now, value is easily swayed by emotional impulses, greed, baseless opinions with little resistance, exacerbated by the absence of objective indicators for accurate assessment.
the monetary value system has liberatingly distanced itself from its origins to yield entirely to subjective forces.
in this realm, where speculation dictates outcomes, the fluidity and responsiveness of money-based values showcase its profound reliance on subjectivity.
i was once told by someone that they had a strong impulse to purchase everything they truly admired, not for their own sake or to own them, but solely to actively express their fondness for these items.
their sole intention was to allow these items to flow through their hands, imprinting them with the stamp of their unique personality.
money served as a distinct means of extending their identity, rather than for the purpose of possessing material goods.
this individual possessed a personality that was disinterested in dominating objects; their contentment stemmed from the transient influence they exerted over these items.
while it might seem that this lack of a deep connection to objects would not add to their sense of fulfillment, the act of purchasing itself brought them satisfaction as the objects displayed total subservience to money.
compared to typical extravagance, limited to acquiring and enjoying possessions and simply wasting money, this man's behavior is notably eccentric due to his strong attraction to material pleasures closely within reach.
the lack of actual ownership and utilization of items contrasts with the gratification he derives from the act of purchasing, considering it a personal connection with the objects and a source of satisfaction.
this unique dynamic can be attributed to how spending money expands his sense of self, creating a bridge between himself and the material world.
this transactional bond allows his mind to delve into the allure of possession, even if it is not physically attained.
the concept of objects opens up effortlessly and harmoniously to aesthetic contemplation, appearing as if they are guided solely by the fundamental laws of the self.
this results in a sense of liberation integral to the aesthetic experience, freeing one from the mundane pressures of material possessions to allow for a joyful and unencumbered connection between the self and objects that typically exert a heavy influence.
this psychological aspect of finding pleasure in mere ownership of money involves a unique fusion, abstraction, and prelude to actual possession.
it grants consciousness the freedom to extend itself through a pliant medium without resistance, embracing all potentialities without distorting reality, characteristics that are essential components of any aesthetic enjoyment.
the idea that beauty is a promise of happiness underscores the resemblance between the psychological allure of aesthetics and the attraction of money.
ultimately, the appeal of money seems to lie in the promise of the pleasures it can facilitate.
the paradox lies in the contrast between the means typically used to generate wealth, which often lack joy, and the unconventional manner in which individuals express their joy.
however, it is important to recognize that the satisfaction derived from possessing money is a cerebral experience removed from immediate sensory pleasure.
this pleasure is akin to the intense elation felt in victory, where the reward itself may not even be a primary consideration for some individuals.
certainly, greed can extend beyond its limits, yet it exposes its folly through the inherent dissatisfaction inherent in its pursuit, as well as the occasional irony when an excessive accumulation of possessions transforms into something contrary to its original purpose.
this can result in situations such as unprofitable ownership when an owner lacks the effort to yield returns, a tyrant who tires of dominating slaves once faced with unchallenged submission, or a property holder too consumed by managing their assets to actually enjoy them due to exhaustion of time and energy.
the difference between objects lies in their capacity to absorb aspects of personality simultaneously, determining the threshold where possession becomes insignificant as the self can only regulate it until a certain extent.
money, in particular, holds a unique status in this aspect.
it can be argued that managing, controlling, and deriving pleasure from money demands less from an individual in comparison to other possessions.
consequently, one can assert that the magnitude of possessions one can oversee and accumulate as part of their economic persona is greater with money than with other types of assets.
an individual's capacity for growth, constrained by their inherent nature, demonstrates more flexibility and liberty concerning money compared to any other possession.
the distinction from our prior discussions lies in this: previously, it was the distinctive nature of objects hindering self-expansion, while now it's the constraints on personal power that decline once a certain amount of possessions is acquired, despite the inherent flexibility of the items.
this phenomenon is delayed when possessions are in the form of money rather than specific objects.
throughout the history of ideas, we witness a development that, though seemingly straightforward, stands as one of the most significant expressions of intellectual life due to its thorough and profound realization.
initially, particular fields are entirely defined by distinct traits.
over time, this unity diversifies into increasingly specialized subsets, with one capturing the essence of the whole in a limited manner and standing in contrast to other parts.
to put it another way, despite a relative contrast between two elements of a whole, each may still embody the essence of one of them, albeit in an absolute form.
for example, the moral-philosophical argument for egoism may rightly argue that individuals inherently act in their self-interest and for personal gratification.
however, distinction must be made between egoism in a narrower versus broader context.
the influence of wealth in facilitating connections allows the owner and their belongings to be geographically distant from each other, granting them the freedom to pursue their individual principles more independently compared to a time when their relationship was more direct.
in the past, economic transactions held a personal aspect, with any shift in personal circumstances automatically affecting one's economic concerns.
for traditional societies worldwide, there was a strong connection between individuals and their possessions, evident in the practice of burying personal acquisitions with the owner.
such rituals highlight how this close association between people and their belongings hindered cultural advancement, which relies on the accumulation of inherited assets.
it is through inheritance that possessions transcend individual boundaries, gaining autonomy and contributing to broader cultural progress.
the influence of money-driven differentiation and resulting individual freedom extends beyond just the rentier to impact labor relationships.
these relationships, although more subtle, echo similar dynamics.
previously, economic structures like crafts and retail relied on personal hierarchies between apprentice and master, employee and employer.
transactions were rooted in personal connections and carried out under the influence of dominant personalities.
however, as technical and objective factors have gained prominence over personal ones, these dynamics have evolved.
in contemporary settings, such as large department stores, the roles of production managers, laborers, directors, and salespeople are all guided by a common objective purpose, with subordination being a technical necessity for the efficient functioning of production processes.
as we have observed, the money economy has set the stage for the evolution of culture in this direction.
the detachment of workers from their means of production, a situation often viewed as the root of social distress, could potentially be seen as a form of liberation in a contrasting light.
if this separation were to result in the personal distinction of the worker as an individual from the strictly objective circumstances imposed on them by the methods of production, it could be interpreted as a form of redemption.
this scenario exemplifies a common phenomenon in which the significance of a particular element transforms into its opposite once it has realized a fundamental, coherent, and all-encompassing impact beyond its initial limited capacity, as facilitated by money.
the kind and gracious treatment of the bondsman has largely vanished as monetary payments took precedence over contributions in kind, and strict officials replaced the local lords who resided near the serfs.
the introduction of officials marked the depersonalization of management.
these officials operated based on technical standards to achieve optimal results, acting as intermediaries between the serfs and the lords, just as money facilitated transactions between them.
this separation highlighted the role of mediators, leading to potential dishonesty by bailiffs in handling monetary payments on behalf of the lords.
despite the benefits of personal relationships for peasants, transitioning to monetary transactions symbolized a shift towards objectification and fraud.
nonetheless, this transformation was deemed essential for ultimately abolishing serfdom altogether.
the significance of money in this series is highlighted not just by the receiver, but also by the giver.
money allows us to evaluate the overall value of an individual worker's efforts compared to the combined contributions of many individuals, whether it's the tickets purchased by concert attendees, books bought by readers, or the taxes paid by citizens that fund government employees.
this connection is especially apparent in how the money economy is linked to the rise of mechanical reproductions.
following the advent of book printing, the cost per sheet of paper remains consistent regardless of the quality of content, be it mediocre or exceptional.
similarly, with the introduction of photography, a reproduction of a renowned painting costs no more than that of an image of a cabaret singer.
as the mechanized manufacturing of household items became widespread, well-designed utensils are just as affordable as those of inferior quality.
any disparity in earnings between creators is solely due to higher demand for one type over another, with all consumers paying the same price irrespective of the item's merit.
this illustrates the egalitarian nature of money in contrast to the hierarchical systems of feudalism or patronage when bestowing gifts upon esteemed individuals.
conversely, the facelessness of monetary transactions fosters the personal autonomy and unrestricted development of the vendor, guaranteeing their subjective independence.
the swift rise of mechanical reproduction methods, especially, leads to a situation where the price of a product becomes disconnected from its quality.
this disconnect severs the link that tied a specific wage to a particular accomplishment, which previously united the buyer and the producer.
as the distinction between an individual and their achievements deepens, money plays a role in fostering the autonomy of the individual, irrespective of whether this separation stems from the increasing autonomy of the person or their accomplishments.
this societal pattern is pervasive and permeates through individuals.
money not only impacts the constituents of a person but also significantly influences societal components, namely individuals.
this facet of the monetary system is frequently underscored since money serves as a conduit to the accomplishments of others.
in contrast to the time preceding the advent of a monetary system when an individual's reliance was direct on their community and service exchange tightly knit everyone with society, nowadays, each person encapsulates within them a latent entitlement to the accomplishments of others.
everyone holds the power to determine when and where they wish to exercise this entitlement, thereby diluting the direct connections of the former barter system.
money has a significant impact on the relationships between individuals and the broader group, leading to greater independence.
it also brings about a new level of differentiation in the nature of associations and the connection of their members to them.
in medieval times, organizations like guilds encompassed individuals entirely, encompassing technical, social, religious, and political aspects beyond just representing a specific trade.
members were fully engaged in these associations based on shared interests.
however, in today's money-centric economy, numerous organizations exist that solely rely on monetary contributions or focus primarily on financial gains.
a prime example is the joint-stock company, where shareholders are united by their pursuit of dividends with little regard to the company's actual output.
the influence of money in society goes beyond being just a unifier; it can also lead to disintegration, depending on the historical context.
for example, the traditional unity and closeness within families have eroded due to the prevalence of a monetary economy.
families are now often viewed primarily as mechanisms for passing down inheritance.
in cases where a particular interest undermines all other aspects that hold a group together, this interest can end up being the sole remaining bond among the group members.
money not only forges connections due to its inherent nature but also by breaking down existing relationships, creating links between individuals who might otherwise have no association with each other.
a rule that can often be broadly applied to social development is that as a social group expands, the individuals within it tend to become more individualized and independent.
typically, societies begin with small, closely connected groups where members share strong bonds, but as they progress, they evolve into larger groups that offer freedom, independence, and differentiation among individuals.
various examples from family structures, religious communities, economic cooperatives, and political parties demonstrate this pattern.
the significance of money in fostering individuality is intricately linked to its role in expanding social groups.
the relationship between the money economy and the scale of economic entities has been explored previously.
each type of honor originates from an estate or a specific social class, and the honor attributed to an individual or humanity at large is collectively defined by the smaller groups within the broader society.
in situations where honor does not require one to be subservient but instead emphasizes individual distinction, there is a need for a certain level of exclusivity and unity within the group.
for example, the winner of the olympics would be celebrated in a closely-knit region of greece with shared interests.
monetary rewards tend to appeal more to individuals within larger groups due to their self-centered nature.
conversely, the selfless nature of honor, reflecting solidarity within smaller groups, is exemplified by traditions such as the golden wreath awarded for good governance being dedicated to a temple.
even today, within specialized communities like sports or industries, the bestowing of honorary awards is still deemed meaningful and appropriate.
expanding the social group necessitates adopting a system of quantifying merit in monetary values as it leads to the inevitable fragmentation of the group.
as it's challenging to evoke the same level of connection and sentiment in a larger group compared to a smaller one, establishing differences within a larger group necessitates a method where individuals are not solely reliant on the approval and collaboration of the entire group.
during the middle ages in germany, commercial law initially pertained to the collaborative regulations of individual merchant groups.
over time, it evolved into a universal common law, driven by the concept that the entire merchant community of the german empire, and possibly beyond, constituted a vast guild.
consequently, this common law governing merchants transitioned into regulating commercial transactions.
this progression exemplifies how the law shifted from being connected to specific individuals to encompassing broader groups and focusing on objective transactions.
this shift in focus was encouraged by and also promoted the expansion of monetary dealings.
according to a twelfth-century irish manuscript, land was divided due to the expansion of families, and in russia, the shift from communal to private property is evident as population growth promotes this transition.
money is identified as the ideal basis for private ownership, enabling the partitioning of property, establishment of ownership rights, and fulfillment of individual interests.
monetary exchange is essential for expanding economic opportunities, serving as the fundamental mechanism for broadening economic spheres.
money, in its abstract form, originates from economic transactions within a large circle.
its primarily quantitative nature allows for precise mechanical representation of specific demands, individual work values, and personal inclinations.
through this, money fulfills in the economic realm the broader sociological connection between group expansion and individuality development.
the link between money and private property, as well as its role in fostering individual development, is greatly influenced by its mobility, a stark contrast to land ownership.
land ownership surpasses individual ties in two ways: horizontally, as it often suits collective ownership by a group, and vertically, as it is ideal for passing down through generations.
if a primordial group owned only land, development would progress in two key directions.
firstly, as the land produces food, it gains more fluidity, eventually leading to the emergence of private property.
typically, nomadic communities consider land as communal property for the tribe but allocate it for individual families' use, whereas livestock is treated as the private property of these families.
historically, nomadic tribes do not share livestock communally as property.
it has been noted that in the nicobar islands, it is a cultural norm to not inherit assets from relatives, except for trees and dwellings which are considered immovable property and can be passed on to others.
there exists a unique duality in our relationship with possessions, whereby people endure while objects change, and vice versa.
when dealing with movable property, the focus is on the individual, emphasizing their importance.
however, with immovable property such as land, individuals take a backseat as these assets hold more permanence and significance.
land is viewed as a stable foundation on which individual life unfolds, similar to a wave rolling in and out.
this perspective explains the strong connection between landed property and aristocracy, where inheritance plays a key role.
during the merovingian period, the value of the solidus changed from 40 denari to 12 denari.
this adjustment was likely made to lower fines that were previously calculated in solidi, leading to the introduction of a new standard where fines were set at 12 denari instead of 40.
over time, this practice of imposing fines in 12 denari evolved and became widely accepted.
interestingly, in the palau islands, all forms of payment are referred to simply as fines.
it is noteworthy that the severity of an offense was not determined by the different types of coins, but rather by the value assigned to the offense, which in turn determined the monetary penalties.
during the middle ages in the vicinity of florence, various categories of serfs such as coloni, sedentes, quilini, inquilini, adscripticii, censiti, and others existed, with their servitude likely being inversely related to their wergild, leading to no wergild at all for those entirely dependent.
even in the thirteenth century, this antiquated and mostly symbolic standard was still used in courts to determine the credibility of testimonies.
viewed from an individualistic perspective, the concept of wergild should have been upheld more firmly for those who were completely under the ownership of others.
the deviation from this and the hierarchical structure serving as a symbol of the significance of personal testimony underscore the transformation of wergild into a representation of a person's inherent value.
the elevation of the value of human beings can be attributed to christianity, as its beliefs influenced various other evaluations.
however, the full implications of this shift were delayed for quite some time.
the church, although not as proactive against slavery as it should have been, did advocate for compensation in cases of homicide to maintain public order and prevent bloodshed.
despite removing human value from relative and purely quantitative measures, this stance aligns with christian principles.
a key aspect that distinguishes advanced cultures from more primitive ones is the complexity and length of their teleological processes.
the needs of early humans were few and could be fulfilled through a short chain of means if met at all.
through their connection to the one god, they found significance, absoluteness, and transcendency reflected upon them.
the powerful authoritative proclamation that espoused an eternal fate and boundless importance of the soul nullified all merely relative or quantitative differences in value.
the concept of a final mission, which christianity associated with the inherent worth of the soul, has evidently undergone a unique evolution.
just as every desire grows more enduring when satisfied, christianity, by continually emphasizing the idea over time, has deeply instilled the longing for a definitive purpose.
consequently, those who now reject this doctrine will carry with them a sense of unfulfilled yearning for a clear purpose in their existence, as the need has persisted beyond its realization.
the new objective is to impact the individual directly, with any punishment being used as a tool to achieve this goal.
monetary fines now have a different purpose compared to previous compensation for injuries or fatalities.
they are not meant to repay for the harm caused but to cause discomfort to the offender.
therefore, in situations of insolvency, modern law substitutes imprisonment, which not only does not generate revenue for the state but also demands significant expenses.
fines are imposed based on the subjective responses they elicit from the perpetrator.
consequently, fines can instill a personal attribute distinct from money itself.
this attribute is supported by certain qualities that make fines more effective than other forms of punishment: they can be tailored, fully waived, and unlike imprisonment or physical harm in the past, fines do not incapacitate or diminish the offender's ability to work but instead motivate them to make amends for their actions.
in primitive conditions, money can exhibit a contrasting quality from its typical attributes, taking on a sacred and prestigious status.
this notion is exemplified by the rigid rules observed in certain societies, where specific forms of currency were reserved solely for significant or ceremonial transactions, as demonstrated in the practices of the caroline islands.
despite the islanders' self-sufficiency, money holds considerable importance as it influences marriage arrangements, local governance structures, and community standing.
unlike in more developed societies where money primarily fulfills basic needs, in such circumstances, it serves higher social functions beyond mere economic transactions.
among californian indians, even after shell money ceased to be in use, it continued to be offered as a gift to the deceased for their journey to the happy hunting grounds.
at this stage of development, the religious practice of atonement or giving payment in its traditional form implied that regular currency was deemed inadequate for the sanctity of such rituals.
this concept resulted in a devaluation of money, similar to the earlier mentioned opposing trend.
eventually, it separated the value of humanity from the value of currency, which significantly influenced the evolution of the importance of money.
an additional illustration of this concept can be found in the medieval prohibitions against charging interest, which were based on the belief that money should not be treated as a commodity.
rather, money was viewed as static and unproductive, making it sinful to seek compensation for its use in the same way one would for a tangible item.
the separation of a person's worth from monetary value, seen in reducing fines for minor offenses, is countered by another trend.
the legal consequences for wrongdoing are increasingly limited to situations where the victim's loss can be quantified monetarily.
across different cultural stages, this trend appears less frequent in lower levels and progresses at higher ones.
in social contexts where money holds more significance, like urban areas compared to rural settings with a lower socioeconomic status, the value of an individual is often equated to a monetary value.
for example, in modern arabia, tribal vengeance is common in rural regions, while urban centers prioritize monetary compensation through wergild.
the purpose of the law is to penalize any fraudulent act that causes harm to personal assets under the assumption that all such assets hold a monetary value.
the ancient concept of wergild comes into play here, albeit in a basic form.
if compensation for the loss of a personal asset can be made through monetary restitution, it implies that the value of that asset can be equated to money.
nonetheless, contemporary criminal law does not accept that monetary compensation is sufficient for fraudulent damages.
however, there is a prevailing idea that the ill-gotten gains from fraud can be quantified in monetary terms based on the nature of the offense.
only a few instances highlighted by legal professionals need attention here: a landlord prohibiting a tenant from using the garden despite contractual permission, a traveler denied accommodation by a hotel owner despite prior written confirmation, and a teacher breaching a contract with a school principal without arranging for a replacement.
even though these individuals have valid claims to compensation, quantifying the damages in monetary terms is challenging due to the subjective nature of the inconveniences and hardships faced.
without a precise monetary demonstration, these damages may be perceived as insignificant by the judge and may not be acknowledged in a legal context.
it is fascinating to note how roman law, during its middle period, held a contrasting perspective on this matter.
unlike contemporary civil suits, where monetary restitution was typically equal to the value of the object, roman law imposed penalties that exceeded this amount.
these penalties were granted to the aggrieved party as a means of compensating them for any deceit or harm inflicted by the defendant.
for instance, if a deposit was wrongfully withheld or funds entrusted to a guardian for a ward were misused, the restitution did not solely involve returning the money.
the judge, and sometimes even the plaintiff, had the authority to determine compensation not just for the direct monetary loss but also for the intentional violation of the individual's legal rights.
this approach indicates that the principles upheld by the law extend beyond the monetary worth of an object, emphasizing that infractions against personal values necessitate penalties that surpass mere restitution.
in one scenario, money plays a minor role, while in the other, it holds a more significant position compared to today.
this current situation illustrates a blend of the contrasting tendencies that modern culture attaches to the role of money.
on one side, money is elevated to a point where it becomes the driving force behind practical interests, overshadowing personal values when it exceeds its appropriate boundaries.
on the flip side, modern culture detaches money from personal values, diminishing its alignment with authentic personal aspects and ultimately quashing the promotion of personal values instead of settling for an insufficient substitute.
analogies can be drawn to past situations where individuals were valued based on monetary compensation, particularly in the context of the historical practice of purchasing women.
the prevalent occurrence of marriage by purchase, both in civilized societies of the past and in present-day less developed regions, along with its diverse forms, is widely acknowledged.
our focus lies on deriving insights on the types of values that were exchanged in such transactions.
criticisms of the perceived degradation associated with buying individuals for money or its equivalents in modern times may not always be applicable when considering historical contexts.
the corporate-like approach undeniably diminishes the uniqueness of individuals and their relationships.
however, the systematization of marital affairs as seen in the practice of arranged marriages represents a significant advancement compared to the more barbaric practices of forced marriages or primitive sexual unions.
while not entirely promiscuous, these primitive arrangements lacked the stabilizing influence provided by the regulated union of marriage.
throughout history, human development has often necessitated the temporary suppression of individuality as a crucial step towards eventual liberation.
during these transitional phases, the external constraints of life tend to foster spiritual growth, leading to the accumulation of inner strength that later manifests as personal integrity.
though such periods may seem brutal and undignified when viewed through the lens of fully realized individuality, they play a pivotal role in the overall evolution of society.
in narinyeri culture, marriage is traditionally sealed through the exchange of sisters between two men.
when a girl decides to elope with a lover instead of following this custom, she is seen as socially inferior and forfeits the protection that her birth clan would typically provide.
this highlights the communal nature of such marriages, where the clan's support is contingent on the exchange being honored.
by running away, the girl essentially loses the backing of her clan due to the imbalance created by not fulfilling the marriage arrangement.
the introduction of a money economy within the sphere of production combines objective technology, extensive social connections, and wealth alongside the division of labor, resulting in a shift from an earlier state of apathy between domestic and acquisition interests to a need for specialized representation for each.
this evolution clarifies the definitive roles of husband and wife.
the traditional bride price paid by the groom to acquire the woman's productive abilities is now substituted by a dowry.
the dowry serves as a form of compensation for the husband's obligation to provide for the wife, aiming to offer her independence and security alongside her economically active spouse.
this dynamic sheds light on the role of a pimp and the commonly observed incidence of lesbianism among prostitutes.
due to feeling a profound void and dissatisfaction in her interactions with men, the prostitute seeks a different kind of connection where certain qualities of the partner are present.
the belief that sexual activity is universal and impersonal, along with the equal participation of men and women, does not alter this relationship.
for the woman, the stakes are far more personal, essential, and intertwined with her sense of self than for the man.
consequently, a transaction involving money is inadequate and inappropriate, symbolizing a severe degradation of the female individual.
the decline of a woman in prostitution cannot be solely attributed to its polyandrous nature or the multiplicity of her sexual partners.
the increasing appreciation for human life and the diminishing importance of money made it impossible to uphold the practice of wergild.
as individuals gain unique significance, making them irreplaceable, money has become a standard measure that struggles to equate the diverse range of values placed on personal attributes.
in less advanced cultures, the sharp contrast between the worth of goods and their prices, which characterizes prostitution in modern society, is less prominent.
reports from travelers observing barbaric tribes note the physical and sometimes mental similarity between men and women in these cultures, attributed to the absence of the complex values that distinguish highly civilized women.
in these cultures, personal values, particularly regarding sexual integrity, hold a weight that cannot be equated solely in monetary terms, even though women may seem less differentiated and more similar to the general population compared to men of similar status.
another perspective on marriage for financial gain equates it to a form of prostitution, albeit with distinctions yet susceptible to similar critiques as traditional prostitution.
this viewpoint suggests that although the concept is fundamentally polyandrous as well as polygamous, societal norms dictate that only the negative repercussions of polygamy, specifically the depreciation of the female partner, manifest in financially-driven unions.
therefore, it is argued that engaging in a transactional marriage, essentially a form of permanent self-sale, can potentially diminish the dignity of either party motivated by monetary considerations, irrespective of gender.
nevertheless, this generalization is often disproven in reality.
typically, the woman in such unions tends to wholeheartedly commit her interests and efforts to the relationship, offering her complete self, both core and periphery, without hesitation.
in contrast, the man in a marriage is traditionally afforded greater autonomy from the start, often retaining a significant portion of his identity linked to professional endeavors.
nevertheless, various reservations and counterbalancing factors can curb the rapid expansion of dominant power, including tradition, respect, laws, and inherent constraints on power growth.
however, money, due to its unparalleled adaptability and lack of ethical considerations, is least effective in halting this trend.
in relationships driven by financial interests, where one side inherently holds superiority and advantage, these inclinations may intensify in a more extreme and pervasive manner.
it appears as though other, more impartial motives underpin this type of relationship.
advertising plays a significant role in shaping culture by enhancing an individual's chances of finding satisfaction compared to relying solely on chance encounters.
the increasing customizing of personal needs underscores the importance of advertising in expanding the choices available.
however, among the more discerning individuals, particularly those less reliant on advertising, seeking a marriage partner through ads is generally dismissed.
the rejection could be attributed to the emphasis on financial status evident in marriage advertisements, which takes precedence over other qualities that are challenging to accurately portray in such ads.
the unique methodological aspect of owning money makes marriage ads unattainable for the social groups that would benefit the most, as it suggests prioritizing financial matters over genuine connections.
for the owner, the transparency of values when expressed in money provides a straightforward understanding of their possessions.
however, for others, money offers a means to hide and obscure their assets and transactions, a level of secrecy unattainable with physical property.
money's concealability epitomizes its connection to private ownership.
unlike tangible goods, money can be veiled from view, akin to intellectual assets.
just as keeping mental possessions private involves secrecy, money's individualistic nature culminates in its potential for covert handling.
this secrecy poses a significant risk for those with stakes in economic management but lack direct control over it.
conversely, within small circles, individuals representing the public interest wielded a kind of mystical authority and maintained a level of secrecy that surpassed that of their counterparts in larger groups.
in larger groups, the expansion of their authority, the objectivity of their methods, and their detachment from individuals enabled them to accept the public visibility of authorities' actions.
consequently, politics, administration, and law progressively shed their secrecy and exclusivity, while individuals gained more opportunities to retreat and exclude outsiders from their personal matters.
by examining english and german history or exploring cultural developments over the past two centuries, one can observe this interconnectedness.
this differentiation process is also evident in the religious realm, particularly during the reformation.
certainly, the necessity of warmth can be just as pressing and critical for survival as the need for food.
however, its application is more indirect compared to that of food.
the path to survival involves several intermediary steps, allowing a person being tempted to have more time for contemplation than they would for more immediate needs.
money is the most removed from direct enjoyments; its allure always lies in what it represents, making the temptation emanating from it less of a primal instinct that could justify yielding to it.
it is remarkable that aristides, with his significant authority, passed away impoverished, a phenomenon considered uncommon.
in the ancient small city-states, the integrity of an individual seldom rocked the core of society as only a fraction operated on a monetary system, fostering transparent and straightforward relationships that could be maintained in equilibrium effortlessly.
consequently, it is accurate to state that athens' destiny was hinged on daily deliberations on the pnyx.
in today's intricate public landscape, with myriad hidden influences of the monetary system permeating every facet, corrupting officials have far more destructive repercussions.
the traditional classification of objective norms into logical, ethical, and aesthetic categories falls short when considering practical judgments.
for instance, we appreciate the uniqueness and individuality of a person, valuing their distinct form and influence.
we find value in the unparalleled representation of a person's own essence, even if it contrasts with ethical or aesthetic standards.
rather than seeking a comprehensive normative system, it is crucial to highlight that a systematic approach is inadequate in this context, akin to the limitations posed by sensory perception or kantian philosophical categories.
human evolution constantly introduces fresh ways to engage with the world both emotionally and intellectually, as well as novel criteria for assessment.
the positive outcome of this transformation stemmed from the fact that one party, who had previously brought personal strength and individual determination to the relationship without receiving a fair equivalent, was met with impersonal offerings from the other party.
the rights gained from the relationship remained impersonal, while the obligations undertaken were highly personal.
by converting these obligations into monetary payments, they became depersonalized, eliminating the imbalance between them.
however, the scenario changes if the obligated party cannot be simply compensated with a tangible return, but has gained rights, influence, and personal significance through the relationship due to their distinct personal contributions.
in such cases, transitioning to monetary payments will result in unfavorable consequences, contrasting with the positive outcome in the initial scenario.
the inherent implications of historical constellations can be organized in a progressive manner, where each connection accommodates both the liberty and the suppression of elements depending on their specific relationships.
it is evident that individual relationships can be characterized by either the oppressive submission to another person or the autonomous collaboration.
these dynamics shift when an impersonal element becomes the determining factor, whether manifested in an external object or a collective entity where individual subjectivity diminishes.
as demonstrated in the preceding section, the shift to an impersonal entity can be seen as a form of liberation, highlighting how some individuals may choose subjugation to an impersonal collective or objective structure over submission to a person.
i would like to point out that historically slaves and serfs under the state's ownership had relatively comfortable lives.
in contrast, modern warehouse employees under distant management tend to have better conditions than those in small businesses where owners may exploit them personally.
transitioning from personal to impersonal structures can be seen as a loss of dignity and freedom when deeply held personal values are involved.
the aristocratic sentiment of voluntary dedication with extreme sacrifices has increasingly been replaced by feelings of humiliation and degradation, shifting from voluntary acts to legal obligations.
in the sixteenth century, rulers in france, germany, scotland, and the netherlands faced resistance when delegating authority to trained deputies or administrative bodies.
people were more inclined to follow personal authority out of devotion, while compliance with impersonal bodies was merely seen as submission.
hence, it is evident that at times these requests were firmly denied.
for instance, when peter iv of aragon appealed to the aragon estates for financial assistance, they responded that it was not their custom to provide credit.
they explained that while his christian subjects were willing to offer personal services, the offering of money was typically associated with jews and moors.
similarly, in anglo-saxon england, the king lacked the authority to enforce direct taxes; instead, the traditional teutonic belief persisted, emphasizing the obligation of providing personal military and court services to the commonwealth.
the imposition of danegeld by the king under the guise of defense against new invasions symbolized the deterioration of the state.
the people would generally agree to transition from personal services to monetary payments only if it did not imply a shift in power dynamics.
it is common for different factions within the same community to have conflicting views based on their perspectives on this matter.
in addition to instances where the release of financial obligations leads to a decrease in the status of the debtor, another aspect supplements the findings discussed in the previous chapter.
the positive implications for a serf able to fulfill obligations through monetary means have been examined.
conversely, a negative outcome emerges when the serf's association with money is controlled by the landlord, such as purchasing the land the serf previously owned with certain rights.
the prohibitions implemented in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in the former german empire against peasants being bought out were primarily linked to financial or agricultural policies.
nevertheless, there was a sense of injustice towards the peasant if their land was taken, even if compensated fairly in monetary terms.
in instances where freedom is defined solely in negative terms, it is often viewed as inadequate and demeaning.
giordano bruno believed that free will was a flaw specific to humans, highlighting their imperfection compared to god who was bound by necessity.
this abstract concept can be clarified with a concrete example.
the prussian cottagers resided on land separated from the communal farmland, which was divided into mixed strips controlled by shared regulations.
by living on land with independent cultivation rules, the cottagers enjoyed more personal freedom.
however, their exclusion from communal decision-making processes resulted in a limited positive freedom to engage in field-related choices, granting them only the negative freedom of autonomy from communal dictates.
this lack of involvement in community decisions, despite owning significant property, relegated the cottagers to a subordinate position with minimal social standing.
freedom on its own is a hollow structure that only gains meaning, vitality, and worth through the growth of other life elements.
when we scrutinize the processes leading to freedom, we always observe a concrete underlying theme in conjunction with the abstract and pure notion of freedom.
this concrete aspect assigns a positive value to freedom but also establishes specific boundaries, outlining what needs to be achieved through this newfound freedom.
the actions undertaken to attain freedom can be categorized based on the extent to which the material content and benefits exceed the formal and negative aspects of freedom from prior constraints.
for instance, for a young man transitioning from the constraints of school to the free lifestyle of a university student, the latter phase holds greater significance.
when someone trades their rural property for a city house, they escape the challenges of agriculture but face new responsibilities and uncertainties tied to urban real estate.
on the other hand, selling the property for cash offers true freedom, as the relief from previous burdens outweighs the obligations associated with being a money-owner.
this shift results in fewer specific obligations moving forward.
the release from tangible constraints is now minimized, and money becomes the key to achieving freedom by negating constraints.
the prussian redistribution of communal land in the early nineteenth century significantly benefitted a class of day laborers who lacked stability and roots.
access to natural resources like woods and meadows helped maintain the living standards of impoverished peasants, who had no equivalent in theory.
attempts to compensate for the loss of these rights in cash would result in its quick depletion, while land compensation would be inadequate for producing tangible benefits.
as a consequence, these land compensations were turned into monetary payments, inadvertently exacerbating the trend towards proletarianization and the erosion of livelihood.
ethnologists note a similar challenge faced by greek peasant women in purchasing goods from local inhabitants.
with a growing inclination and the expansion of the money economy, there is an increasing impact on objects that are not intended for sale but are seen as permanent possessions closely tied to one's personality.
these include businesses, factories, works of art, collections, landed property, rights, and various positions.
while there is a notable level of freedom in the frequent changing of ownership and conditions of these possessions, the process is hindered by the uncertainty and lack of direction inherent in money.
as a result, despite the liberating aspects of this continuous exchange, there is often a failure to establish new foundations and lasting connections.
it is evident that the value of things goes beyond their monetary worth when selling a service rather than a product, especially when that service is unique not only in its physical execution but also in its essence.
this distinction becomes apparent in various scenarios.
in transactions involving money and services, the buyer typically seeks the specific service or result offered.
conversely, the provider often desires more than just payment.
for example, while a concert attendee may be content if the performance matches expectations, the artist performing seeks not only payment but also the audience's appreciation in the form of applause.
similarly, subjective offenses cannot simply be erased as if they never occurred, unlike tangible external damages.
if the offender believes that undergoing punishment alone leads to complete redemption, it is actually due to an internal transformation that uproots the foundation of the wrongdoing.
the insufficiency of punishment in erasing the offense is evident in the lingering mistrust and degradation faced by the wrongdoer post-punishment.
as previously discussed, there is no direct equivalence between qualitatively different elements, unlike the balanced nature of a financial statement.
this discrepancy is further highlighted by the values intrinsic to an individual, which lose significance when detached from their core, giving way to a tangible object like money as the ultimate measure.
it is deemed acceptable to consider offering valuable items or performances for a high price, and if that isn't feasible, it is preferable to give them as a gift rather than accepting a low price for them.
the latter act would be seen as demeaning, unlike the former.
therefore, in the company of sophisticated and delicate individuals, gifts intended to honor someone should downplay their monetary worth.
the transient nature of flowers and confections that one might consider gifting to a lady of limited acquaintance denotes the absence of significant value.
the value disparity between a specific task and its monetary equivalent may not always be evident or easily quantifiable, as seen in historical examples like the artist, physician, official, and scholar.
when the task is generic and performed by an average individual, such as an unskilled laborer, there is a lack of uniqueness and personal expression in the work.
whether the worker is adequately compensated for any added value typically depends on their social standing and the level of recognition they receive.
in cases where recognition is lacking due to a lower social status, the individual may feel degraded when forced to trade their personal value solely for monetary gain.
hence, the contempt towards medieval minstrels stemmed from their practice of singing both joyful and sorrowful songs for payment, which was seen as a debasement of their genuine emotions in exchange for money instead of esteem.
to preclude any notion of virtuous recompense, it was deemed appropriate to treat them fairly in monetary terms alone, excluding intangible rewards.
despite their overall unfavorable circumstances, minstrels were dealt with equitably, ensuring they were remunerated as justified.
when authentic personal values are commodified solely for financial gain without additional non-monetary recompense, it can lead to a dilution or even a loss of intrinsic value in individual lives.
the sentiment that personal principles are bartered in financial dealings for inadequate renumeration is a key reason why transactions involving money have often been reviled by proud and principled individuals, with agriculture, as its antithesis, extolled as the sole respectable pursuit.
it is a common sociological observation that contrasts between elements are most apparent when they share a common origin.
for instance, sects within the same religion often exhibit more intense animosity towards each other than towards completely different religious groups.
similarly, rivalries between small neighboring city-states are typically more fervent than those between larger countries with distinct spatial and strategic interests.
some argue that the most profound animosity can be found among blood relatives.
this escalation of tension arising from shared interests can peak when those shared interests evolve, potentially leading to a blurring of distinctions.
as lower and higher elements draw closer, the latter tends to accentuate remaining differences and place greater value on them.
nevertheless, its value remains equivalent to the labor spent to obtain it, serving as the benchmark for its exchange value concerning the specific natural product.
if labor is indeed the ultimate arbitrator for all value assessments of the item, employing an external entity like money for measurement seems unfitting and deflective.
instead, the focus should be on finding a way to symbolize the intrinsic unity of labor in a form that can serve both as a medium of exchange and a standard of measurement – a role typically fulfilled by money.
declining to take a stance on the definitive unification of value, i assert that the labor theory of value stands out as the most intriguing theory from a philosophical standpoint.
in the realm of human existence, the material and intellectual facets, comprising intellect and will, coalesce harmoniously through labor, a state unattainable when these aspects are viewed in isolation.
labor functions as the unified conduit where these elements blend akin to converging river sources, erasing their individual complexities and culminating in a unified product.
if labor indeed solely dictates value, it would be submerged within the specific juncture of our practical essence, necessitating the selection of the most fitting representation in the external realm.
however, the third crucial mental factor essential for creating the chair at hand is not subject to potential consumption.
with this chair's design, numerous copies can be manufactured without depreciating the plan itself, requiring restoration, or inflating the cost of production.
despite serving as the defining, material-intellectual blueprint for each chair, the plan remains unaffected.
by accurately discerning between the objective-mental content within a product and the subjective-mental process driving its creation based on the content model, we can appreciate the argument that mental labor carries no monetary expense.
once a thought has been articulated, it is impossible to repossess it with any force in the world.
the concept becomes permanently accessible to anyone who exerts the necessary mental effort to recollect it.
conversely, once a thought is expressed, it cannot be appropriated again by any means.
it remains intricately linked to the individual as a perpetually reproducible entity, distinct from the dynamics of the financial realm.
this indicates that the intellectual process holds significance beyond economic realms, intertwining with the psychological domain.
therefore, our focus lies solely on the latter aspect, exploring how mental exertion contributes to value creation in conjunction with physical labor.
should one decide to take on this challenge, it becomes imperative to somehow condense these interests and attributes into a form that allows for a somewhat even distribution.
i understand that contemporary scientific socialism does not advocate for a mechanical-communist approach to equality, but rather aims to create equal working conditions, fostering a range of positions and contentments based on individual talents, strengths, and efforts.
in the current landscape where factors like inherited wealth, social class distinctions, capital accumulation, and unequal economic opportunities widen disparities more than differences in individual contributions, achieving not only a fundamental leveling in all aspects but also an equalization in ownership and contentment becomes essential.
these, i believe, remain crucial catalysts for mobilizing the masses effectively.
if historical materialism is utilized as the scientific foundation for the socialist doctrine, the central concern arises from the deliberate construction of a pathway that contrasts with the organic flow of creative thinking.
in this context, socialist theory does not simply stem from a deductive application of historical materialism but is instead contingent on the practical establishment of a socialistic-communistic inclination, which underscores economic interests as the primary and unifying factor.
subsequently, this economic inclination must evolve to condense its multifaceted elements into a cohesive unity that transcends individual contributions and upholds the prospect of achieving equality and fairness that can be externally validated.
the argument that the value of all valuable items depends solely on their labor costs is insufficient.
it is conceivable to consolidate the diverse qualitative aspects of labor in a way that a smaller amount of more skilled labor could produce a similar or higher value compared to a significantly larger amount of less skilled labor.
however, in doing so, a completely different system of value would emerge than the one being discussed.
specialization, intellectuality, and complexity would continue to be inherent qualities in labor, but they would be viewed only as attributes of labor rather than as determining factors of value.
ultimately, the basis of value would no longer be rooted in labor itself, but in the hierarchy of qualities structured based on an independent principle.
in this scenario, labor, as the universal component of all labor qualities, would merely play a minor role.
similarly, a coherent labor theory needs to uphold the notion that any unequivocal and undisputed value differences between two accomplishments that may seem equally demanding in terms of labor input ultimately indicate that one involves more labor than the other.
at first glance, these achievements might appear to require the same amount of labor, but upon closer inspection, the underlying basis for their varying values lies in the disparities in the amount of labor involved.
disregarding coincidences stemming from the intricacies of historical events would make it extremely difficult to uphold any fundamental social connections.
in my opinion, it is possible to argue that the varying assessments of performance qualities reflecting the same subjective level of labor nonetheless signify the differing levels of labor inherent in individual accomplishments in an indirect manner.
consequently, this temporarily ensures benefits for the theoretical alignment of economic values on which the labor theory is based.
in this envisioning, mental work would be regarded equally to physical labor, with its outcomes evaluated purely on a quantitative basis alongside those of manual labor.
this represents a scientific ideal that highlights how converting all quantifiable work into manual labor might not inherently entail any fundamental logical inconsistency, even from a non-dogmatic materialistic perspective.
this challenges the perceived dualism between intellect and physicality that is often associated with such efforts.
as this connection exists exclusively within these two labor categories, it results in a never-ending series where mental labor continuously recedes but never disappears entirely.
consequently, the sustenance of the most advanced labor categories also relies on a chain of labor tasks where the cognitive input of each individual is compensated by others with purely physical contributions, gradually approaching almost negligible value.
it is conceivable that all external requirements for mental work can essentially be quantified in terms of manual labor.
if the traditional cost value theory was deemed valid, the worth of mental labor, equating its production costs, would equate to the value of specific manual tasks.
this theory might hold ground in a revised form.
the idea that the value of mental activity should directly correspond to the means of subsistence may seem paradoxical and lacking in meaning.
yet, it is worthwhile to explore a point where reality somewhat aligns with this concept as it delves into the internal and cultural connections between intellectual values and their economic foundations.
it can be speculated that the brain holds a significant amount of stored energy as the main focus of organic development.
this stored energy enables the brain to release a considerable amount of energy, leading to the remarkable efficiency of weaker muscles that can be activated by mental impulses.
the profound exhaustion experienced by the entire body following intellectual exertion or changes further suggests that mental activity, when considered in terms of its physical counterpart, consumes a substantial amount of organic energy.
restoring energy does not solely depend on increasing the basic necessities for manual workers, as the body has limitations on the amount of nourishment it can effectively utilize.
this limitation is even more noticeable for jobs that focus mainly on mental tasks.
therefore, the revival of energy, similar to the essential mental stimulation needed for mental work, often requires a focused, nuanced, and personalized approach to one's lifestyle and overall living conditions.
two pivotal factors of cultural and historical significance play a role here.
our daily lifestyle habits were crafted and honed during a time when the prevalent living conditions drastically varied from today's environment, particularly for intellectual groups where physical labor and exposure to fresh air surpassed the challenges of nervous strain and a sedentary lifestyle.
the abundance of both direct and indirect digestive ailments on one side, and the rush to find concentrated and easily digestible foods on the other, highlight a significant breakdown in the alignment between our physical constitution and dietary habits.
this broad observation underscores the validity of the varying nutritional needs among individuals with diverse professions, emphasizing that dietary requirements are crucial not just for culinary pleasure but for maintaining the well-being of individuals, particularly high-skilled workers who must ensure access to a specialized diet tailored to their specific nutritional needs.
moreover, a more concealed yet crucial aspect is that intellectual work pervades various aspects of life to a greater extent and is embedded in a broader network of interconnected relationships than manual labor.
this fact highlights an inherent discord between the principles of quality and fairness on one hand, and the drive to increase productivity on the other, which is often overlooked.
the unique blend of our physical and mental makeup, the dynamic interplay between enabling and constraining forces, and the interconnection of intellect and will, all contribute to a scenario where personal achievement, influenced by individual traits and circumstances, encounters a significant inconsistency.
this means that any change in one aspect necessitates a corresponding and sometimes substantial adjustment in the other to yield a similar outcome.
moreover, it appears that these innate disparities in realizing one's full potential become more pronounced in advanced, intricate, and intellectual domains of accomplishment.
in contrast, individuals reliant solely on physical strength for a given task would maintain similar dietary and lifestyle requirements for its execution.
there is yet another perspective to consider regarding the reduction of all labor value to that of manual labor, revealing its simplistic and common nature.
the true validation and significance of physical labor as a form of value and effort do not solely stem from physical strength alone.
it is not merely about the fact that physical labor would be pointless for human needs without some level of intellectual direction.
instead, the critical component that imbues physical labor with its value and worth is the incorporation of mental energy.
the complete essence and worth of physical labor are derived from the utilization of mental capacity within it.
despite being perceived as irrelevant and not emotionally connected to us, the possession of an object may prompt us to seek compensation only when it arises from a strong internal dilemma that necessitates a sacrifice.
in considering value, one could argue that physical labor equates to mental labor, except in cases where humans compete directly with machines or animals.
while all forms of work involve internal effort and mental energy, the latter do not strive to enhance their mental accomplishments since their focus lies solely on achieving results through physical means.
in cost-effective production scenarios, the reward is unlikely to increase as long as cheaper alternatives are available.
expanding this concept to our practical consideration of whether to reward the output of non-human forces solely through the effort of human accomplishment, a fundamental distinction emerges between human labor that derives recognition from its cognitive aspect and that which, resembling mechanized labor, seems to disassociate itself from this criterion for remuneration.
in essence, it is possible to argue broadly that, concerning the value to be recompensed, the differentiation between cognitive and physical work is not a distinction between mental and material essence; instead, compensation is essentially sought in the latter instance for the internal components of labor, such as the reluctance to engage, the exercise of willpower.
the intellectual element presumed to underlie work's external manifestation and constitute its intrinsic worth is actually rooted not in intellect but in emotion and volition.
consequently, it is not aligned with cognitive labor but serves as its foundation.
these comments not only illustrate that the concept of work is primarily associated with muscular activity but also dismiss common arguments against this correlation.
i find no insurmountable challenges in this regard.
the objection often raised is that worthless, unnecessary work exists, which questions the belief that only efficient work, justifiable by its outcomes, should be regarded as fundamental value.
however, debunking this idea inadvertently raises a critical flaw in the entire theory.
the admission that both valuable and worthless work coexist implies the existence of intermediate levels of work that may lack distinct purpose or value.
therefore, the value of a product, supposedly dictated by the labor input, fluctuates based on the efficacy of that labor.
this suggests that the value of work is not measured merely by quantity but rather by the usefulness of its outcomes.
despite acknowledging the inclination of labor money to reconnect money with personal values, each outcome underscores the intertwined nature of the opposition to this with its fundamental essence.
moreover, because money inherently possesses a relentless objectivity in measuring all items and the standard of value it establishes defines their connections, a complex network is created intertwining objective and personal elements of existence that mirrors the natural order with its seamless unity and rigorous causation.
this network is unified by the omnipresent value of money, akin to how nature is bound together by life-giving energy.
much like money, energy manifests in myriad forms, but its intrinsic uniformity and the ability to convert one form to another establish connections among them all, each being essential to the others.
just as the interpretation of natural phenomena has eliminated emotional biases in favor of impartial intellect, the entities and associations in our practical world, as they form increasingly intricate chains, eliminate emotional influence.
they transform into mere subjects of intellect and materialize solely at the teleological endpoints.
the continual evolution of all aspects of existence into tools, the interconnectedness of series that used to end in self-contained goals with a set of interrelated elements, is not just a direct result of the expanding scientific understanding of natural causality and the shift of its certainties into dependences.
this process represents how the entire framework of tools presents a casual relationship when observed from the surface, which in turn makes the practical realm increasingly a challenge for rational thought.
more specifically, the potential components of actions are becoming quantifiable rational connections both objectively and subjectively, gradually phasing out the emotional responses and choices that are typically associated with critical junctures in life or ultimate objectives.
however, even among the most menial laborers, this type of work maintains a distinct identity that has been essential for the recent establishment of trade unions in england.
unlike those who pursue varying opportunities for financial gain, bankers possess a specific character derived from their close association with money, which not only serves as their end goal but also as the foundation of their profession.
over time, this association can lead to defined guidelines, unique sets of interests, and distinct professional traits.
conversely, in precarious occupations, the paths to financial success lack cohesion or commonality.
the homogenizing influence of money, as the primary objective, minimally impacts diverse activities and interests, diminishing the individuality and character that economic pursuits could otherwise impart.
the ruthless intensity of contemporary economic conflicts devoid of compassion is merely a superficial deviation from the characteristics inherent in a money-based economy, as these conflicts stem from a direct pursuit of monetary gain.
these battles unfold within a realm where individual worth is not only defined by personal qualities but also by economic potential, and where today's fierce adversaries may become allies within cartels tomorrow.
what holds significance is that the regulations governing one arena may starkly contrast with those applicable in others, although they are still somewhat intertwined.
for example, a religious group may preach peace while showing aggression towards dissidents and other societal spheres.
similarly, an individual might evoke conflicting emotions and ideas in someone else, opposing their own beliefs and behaving contrary to their own philosophies.
intelligence is not simply a trait that can be attached to a person; rather, it is considered the fundamental core of intelligence itself.
it is the primary method for individuals to develop a connection to objects that is not influenced by subjective biases.
even if we assume that our minds shape all of objective reality, we still recognize as intelligence those mental processes that present reality to us objectively, irrespective of the potential impact of external factors on intelligence.
this situation represents a prime example of dealing with practical matters objectively.
instead of following natural subjective instincts, the focus is solely on the objective relevance of the components involved.
behavior is guided by its objective usefulness rather than personal feelings.
despite this, the society had a strong inclination towards intellectual pursuits.
it excelled in logical reasoning, deep contemplation of the world, and the profound intellectuality evident in both its grandiose imaginings and ethical beliefs.
however, it lacked compared to others in expressing emotions and demonstrating strong determination.
it took on the role of a mere observer and a rational architect of world events, a position that stemmed from emotional choices influenced by the immense suffering that gave rise to a metaphysical-religious perception of cosmic necessity.
this was necessary as individuals were unable to deal with these emotions either through feelings or by channeling them into proactive life practices.
the argument connecting intellectuality and the money economy through their shared traits of objectivity and indeterminacy is open to challenge with a compelling counterargument.
despite the inherent impersonal objectivity of intelligence, a significant link exists between intelligence and individuality, as well as the concept of individualism.
although money might transform impulsive and subjective behaviors into normative and objective standards, it serves as a fertile ground for fostering economic individualism and egoism.
these complexities emphasize the importance of distinguishing between the essence of concepts to comprehend the lifestyles they represent.
by separating the essential objective nature of intellect and money from their respective functions and applications, the dual role they play becomes more understandable.
certain emotions, particularly those intertwined in close personal relationships, hold their utmost significance and worth when kept exclusive to those involved.
similarly, certain goals necessitate that they remain beyond the reach of others in both their pursuit and achievement.
it has been rightfully pointed out that theoretical concepts, conversely, are akin to a torch - their illumination does not diminish even as they spark countless others.
their potential for limitless dissemination does not detract from their significance, making them less subject to personal possession than other aspects of life.
they are inherently presented in a manner that inherently precludes any individual circumstances from altering their essence.
the rationalism of the eighteenth century, ultimately leading to revolution, is closely linked to a strict individualistic perspective.
the opposition to rationalism from herder to the romantics emphasized the emotional depth of life beyond the individual.
this recognition of transcendent emotional capacities also acknowledges collective entities as unified historical truths.
the universal nature of intellectuality, applicable to each person's intellect, contributes to the fragmentation of society.
through the lens of intellect, individuals appear as self-contained entities, seemingly devoid of a concrete universal interconnectedness where individuals form unity through collaboration.
the inherent accessibility and introspective quality of theoretical knowledge, which is universally available, contrasts with its practical application.
the utilization of knowledge is often influenced by factors independent of personal abilities due to its widespread availability.
the extension of the influence of money surpasses that of any other cultural factor, providing equal validation to even the most contradictory aspects of life.
this amplification materializes as a concentration of formal cultural power that can enhance and purify any given content.
in this context, i suggest highlighting parallels with intelligence, particularly in terms of the abstract objectivity that underpins it, supporting self-interest and differentiation.
egoism's rational and logical traits align with the unrestrained exploitation of wealth possession.
as previously noted, money stands out from other forms of assets in its lack of prescribed utility, freeing it from inhibitions regarding its utilization.
similarly, religious forms transcend all temporary specifics to reach a state of absoluteness and universality, thus establishing a connection to what is universally shared among individuals and what binds them in the collective human experience.
through their comprehensive unity, these religious forms liberate individuals from mere personal characteristics by linking them back to fundamental qualities perceived as common roots of humanity.
this universal approach also aligns with kant's theory of morality, where actions that can be logically extended without self-contradiction should serve as moral laws applicable to all individuals, irrespective of their individual identities.
the idea is to view practical principles as natural laws that, through their objective universality, establish moral imperatives for all individuals.
in contrast, modern life in various aspects appears to intensify the conflict between the objective universality of principles and personal connections.
a final noteworthy trait in the contemporary lifestyle reflects a rationalistic nature clearly influenced by money.
broadly speaking, the dominant intellectual functions currently employed to navigate the world and manage individual and social interactions can be characterized as calculative.
their cognitive aim is to view the world as a vast mathematical problem, interpreting events and qualitative distinctions of things through a numerical system.
kant proposed that natural philosophy could only be considered scientific if it integrated mathematics.
this intellectual conquest goes beyond just the physical realm and extends to evaluating life through measures of pleasure and pain, where both pessimism and optimism strive to assign value based on quantitative calculations.
the prevalent use of majority votes to determine public affairs is also a manifestation of this trend.
in our current era, a distinctive psychological trait, marked by a deliberate contrast to the impulsive nature of previous times, appears to be closely linked to the prevalence of a money-driven economy.
the dominance of the money economy necessitates constant mathematical calculations in our daily financial dealings.
many individuals find themselves preoccupied with evaluating, quantifying, and reducing qualitative aspects into quantitative measures.
the process of assessing values in monetary terms has trained us to scrutinize and specify values meticulously, leading to a heightened precision in comparing different aspects of life.
in situations where objects lack a direct monetary correlation and can't be equated solely in financial terms, a more spontaneous evaluation emerges—where items are appraised by comparing them directly to each other.
similar to how money determines abstract value, clocks determine abstract time, offering a detailed and precise system for organizing and measuring, providing a transparency and calculability to life's contents for practical purposes.
the intellectual precision these systems represent contribute to how intellectuality influences modern life.
this dynamic is highlighted when contrasting it with the views of thinkers like goethe, carlyle, and nietzsche who oppose, in a vehemently anti-intellectual way, the economic lens through which human affairs are often interpreted.
these thinkers reject both an exact mathematical interpretation of nature and the role of money in shaping such views.
if we conceptualize culture as the refinement and intellectualized forms of life, the outcomes of mental and practical effort, we position these ideals in a domain where they are not inherently placed by their intrinsic importance.
they are seen as cultural representations only when we perceive them as heightened expressions of natural vigor and capability, elevated beyond what would be attained through their innate characteristics.
a fundamental energy or reference point, essential solely to be outstripped by genuine progress, acts as the foundation for the notion of culture.
in the realm of culture, the values of existence are civilized expressions of nature; they do not possess an independent significance and are not evaluated based on external benchmarks such as happiness, intelligence, and aesthetics.
the cultural process, seen as the supernatural growth of the energies of objects, represents the parallel growth of our own energies.
distinguishing the point where the evolution from natural to cultural life-content occurs is complex and subject to debate, a common challenge in thinking.
the classifications that organize specific phenomena into knowledge are defined in contrast to each other, shaping their significance.
these classifications operate in a non-linear fashion, and the precise placement of particular phenomena within them can be uncertain as their quantitative aspects often influence their categorization.
given the continuous and ever-fluid nature of quantitative attributes and the possibility of intermediary positions between categories, specific phenomena may shift between different classifications based on their quantitative features.
hence, there appears to be an ambiguity between the concepts, involving a blending of ideas that inherently contradict each other.
the essential distinction between nature and culture, signifying that one commences where the other ends, remains steadfast amidst uncertainties regarding the placement of specific phenomena.
just as the delineation between day and night persists despite instances where sunrise and sunset could be linked to either category, the core distinction between nature and culture endures.
over time, the range of topics for conversation has expanded due to advancements in theory and practice.
however, it appears that modern conversations, whether casual, personal, or written, are now perceived as shallower, less engaging, and less profound compared to the late 18th century.
this shift is also reflected in the increasing complexity of machinery surpassing the comprehension of many workers, even in large industries.
few workers today fully grasp the intricacies of the machines they operate.
similarly, military practices have evolved, with individual soldiers experiencing little change or even simplification in their tasks amidst modern warfare methods.
conversely, military tools and the impersonal army organization have significantly evolved, symbolizing a noteworthy achievement in objective culture.
the gap appears to be growing continuously.
each day, the objective cultural wealth is expanding from all directions; however, individual minds can enhance the shapes and substance of their personal growth only by moving even farther away from mainstream culture and advancing at a much slower rate on their own path of development.
our practical existence, while seen as incomplete and fragmented, acquires significance and coherence by contributing to a larger whole.
our actions, along with our complete selves, whether admired or flawed, moral or immoral, grand or minor, appear to stem from a plethora of potentialities.
these actions, at each instance, appear connected to an ideally predetermined essence, akin to how a tangible object corresponds to the abstract concept embodying its innate laws and logical core.
the essence of this concept does not rely on its actualization, or the manner and frequency of such occurrences.
we can only understand cognition as the realization in our consciousness of notions that were inherently waiting to be discovered at a given moment.
our firm conclusion from some established facts of knowledge, that additional facts of knowledge must also be presupposed, serves as an incidental example that highlights the essence of our understanding: acquiring any piece of knowledge entails recognizing something already accepted and confirmed within the objectively defined realm of knowledge content.
from a psychological perspective, this aligns with the concept that believing in a truth involves a distinct sensation coupled with a mental representation; what we define as evidence is essentially the formation of a psychological configuration that elicits such a sensation.
direct sensory observations or logical deductions cannot definitively confirm the existence of reality.
rather, they simply create the circumstances that summon a transcendent feeling of affirmation, agreement, or whatever terminology best captures this somewhat ineffable sense of reality.
the fundamental connection between individuals and culture mirrors the broader relationship between the objective mind and society.
just as we derive our life experiences from objectively sound sources epistemologically, historically most of our life experiences stem from the collective intellectual contributions of humanity.
we encounter pre-existing concepts that await realization by individual minds, maintaining a distinctness separate from material objects.
even when the mind intersects with physical elements like tools, artistic creations, or literature, it retains a unique essence beyond mere sensory perception.
within these creations lies a latent potentiality that individual consciousness can manifest.
objective culture serves as a condensed representation of valid truths that our cognition can reproduce across time.
if we consider that the law of gravity existed before newton articulated it, then the law itself is not inherent in matter.
it merely demonstrates how the relationships between matter appear to a mind that is organized in a certain way.
the validity of the law does not rely on the existence of matter in the physical world.
in this context, the law is not contained within objective reality or subjective perception but rather in the realm of objective spirit, gradually solidifying into reality through our pursuit of truth.
when newton successfully integrated this law into the collective historical consciousness, its essential meaning within that framework became largely detached from the need for individuals to constantly reaffirm it.
if we aim to encapsulate the primary cause and its current scale into a single concept, it would be the concept of the division of labor, both in terms of its significance in production and consumption.
in terms of production, it has often been highlighted that the completion of a product comes at the expense of the producer's personal development.
the enhancement of psychophysical energies and skills resulting from specialized tasks may not contribute significantly to the overall personality, which can often suffer from stunted growth due to the diversion of energies essential for holistic self-development.
sometimes, these developments occur in isolation from the core identity, functioning as an autonomous entity disconnected from the central self.
observations suggest that the inner completeness of an individual primarily emerges from engaging with the coherence and fulfillment of their life's purpose.
the comparison between relationships and works of art is evident in their contrasting characteristics.
unlike relationships that can be subdivided among individuals, a work of art resists such division and requires a unified vision.
a piece of art stands out as the most self-contained entity created by humans, surpassing even the autonomy of the state.
while the state may have autonomy, its elements can still exist independently with their own interests.
in contrast, art eliminates extraneous elements, focusing only on what is relevant for the work to convey its intended message.
the individuality of a work of art ensures that only essential aspects are preserved, stripping away any irrelevant meanings to maintain its purity.
the higher the degree to which an entity made up of subjective elements integrates these parts, where each component contributes solely to the whole, the more objective the entity becomes, and the more its existence becomes detached from the individuals who created it.
in general, an increase in the range of things consumed correlates with a deeper specialization in production.
today, individuals with very specific intellectual and professional focuses still make time to read the newspaper, engaging in a broader mental consumption than was feasible a century ago, even for the most diverse and broadly interested individuals.
nevertheless, this expansion in consumption relies on the advancement of objective culture, as objects that possess a higher level of objectivity and impersonality are more accessible to a larger audience.
the transformation of labor into a commodity, with its convergence in character, evaluation, and destiny with other goods, indicates that work has become a distinct entity detached from the worker, stripping him of both its ownership and essence.
when a worker's potential for labor is actualized, only the monetary value is attributed to the worker, while the labor itself is owned by another individual or an objective labor organization.
this commodification of labor is just a part of the broader process in which individual aspects of one's identity are separated to be perceived as distinct objects with their own autonomous nature and development.
the outcome of the fate of the means of production and labor power is evident in the resulting product.
in the capitalist era, the labor product is characterized by its independent nature, having its own laws of operation, which is detached from the worker producing it.
this is highlighted notably when workers are required to purchase the items they have produced if they desire to possess them.
this overarching development model extends well beyond wage laborers.
the extensive specialization in science, for instance, leads to a scenario where only a select few scholars can access the necessary resources for their research.
countless facts and techniques must be acquired externally as objective resources, serving as the intellectual property of others to be utilized in further investigations.
in the technological field, even as early as the nineteenth century, significant inventions in textile and iron industries emerged rapidly one after another.
during this period, inventors not only had to craft new machines using their own hands without the aid of additional machinery, but they also often needed to create the essential tools necessary for their production.
in a broader context, particularly as suggested here, the current state of science can be described as a scenario where workers are detached from their means of production.
in the scientific research process, the producer's objective materials are distinctly separate from the subjective nature of their work.
when the scientific process was less specialized, scholars had to personally develop the foundations and resources for their work, blurring the line between their personal achievements and a vast array of scientifically established facts.
the higher the social and intellectual status of individuals, the more they rely on the work of those lower down the societal ladder, who are compensated for their efforts monetarily rather than through barter.
this perspective, however, is outdated as modern large enterprises fulfill the needs of the masses by utilizing the expertise and skills of the upper echelons in science, technology, and management.
for instance, a distinguished chemist evaluating dyed colors in a laboratory is indirectly catering to a peasant woman purchasing a vibrantly colored scarf.
similarly, a wholesale trader importing american grain to germany oversees the welfare of the poorest laborer.
even a cotton mill that hires highly skilled workers ultimately serves customers from the lowest economic strata.
numerous present-day instances illustrate this interconnected network of services, where lower classes obtain the goods and services created by higher classes, ultimately influencing our entire culture.
this phenomenon can only occur through the objectification of production, separating it from both the producers and the consumers and elevating production above social and other distinctions.
the practice of hiring the most culturally advanced producers by the least affluent consumers means there is not a direct relationship between them; rather, an object stands between them.
on one side of this object, one group works on it, while on the other side, another group consumes it.
the object both divides the two groups and establishes a connection between them.
this division is primarily due to the specialization in labor, where production techniques are so intricate that the assembly of its various components is delegated not only to greater numbers of people but also to individuals from increasingly diverse backgrounds, leading to the situation where individuals of high status end up working on the most basic necessities.
the more intricate and specialized the tools become, the less opportunity the worker has to convey their personality through them and recognize their personal input in the final product.
in contrast, artists benefit from the simplicity and versatility of their tools, allowing them to fully express their creativity.
unlike industrial machines that limit personal engagement due to their complex nature, traditional artistic tools, like those of a sculptor, have remained unchanged for centuries, offering extensive room for personalization.
instruments like the piano, having undergone significant technical advancements, have also evolved to become more objective, thus constraining subjective expression compared to less complicated tools such as the violin.
the automatic nature of modern machinery is a byproduct of advanced specialization and division of materials and energies, akin to a well-developed state administration that relies on a complex division of labor among its officials.
as machines take on more tasks independently, they begin to appear as autonomous entities to the worker, who, in turn, becomes less of an individual and more of a role player following predefined tasks objectively.
a comparison between a factory worker and a skilled artisan can illustrate how specialized tools limit the influence of personal skills, be they exceptional or subpar.
this scenario allows both the object and the worker to evolve independently.
a generic tool is merely an extension of one's arm, while a specialized tool transcends into a distinct object category.
the presence of objects becomes a source of tension only when we perceive them as independent entities that we serve.
in the same manner that freedom is not merely the absence of restrictions but the active projection of oneself onto objects that comply with it, our own freedom suffers when we engage with items beyond our ego's grasp.
feeling overwhelmed by the externalities of modern life stems from the cycle of these objects presenting themselves as self-sufficient entities.
what troubles us is our apathy towards the multitude of objects surrounding us, a phenomenon fostered by the impersonal nature and replaceability inherent in a capitalist economy.
it's worth noting that the emergence of socialist ideologies within large industrial corporations can be attributed not only to the social circumstances of their workforce but also to the inherent characteristics of their products.
a mechanical device now facilitates the exchange of money for commodities, reflecting a shift in economic dynamics.
this principle is evident not only in stores like the five-cent store, where the process involves moving from price to commodity rather than the other way around.
the universal equivalence of prices across all commodities streamlines the buying process by reducing the need for extensive buyer deliberation and seller explanations.
as a result, economic transactions can efficiently and seamlessly occur without requiring much personal interaction.
the simultaneous differentiation present in fashion carries a similar impact to sequential differentiation.
shifts in trends disrupt the internal exchange between individual and object, which typically avoids any discrepancy.
fashion, uniquely blending distinctiveness and transformation with uniformity and compliance, is a social entity reflecting a specific social class.
it signifies a social tier using a shared appearance to uphold its unity while distinguishing itself from other tiers.
when lower classes emulate the styles of the higher ranks, new trends emerge.
throughout history, fashion trends have consistently been a vehicle for illustrating societal distinctions.
the rapid social transformations of the past century have notably hastened the evolution of fashion trends.
this acceleration is attributed to the breakdown of traditional class boundaries and the increased social mobility of individuals and groups to higher classes.
this shift has necessitated frequent changes in fashion among the elite, as lower classes quickly adopt and dilute prevailing trends.
concurrently, the dominance of the third estate also plays a crucial role.
unlike the more conservative elite and rural populations, the middle class and urban dwellers exhibit greater variability and openness to change.
these groups often seek innovation and find expression through fashion, reflecting their psychological dynamics in the evolving and diverse forms of styles and trends.
only in a landscape of various styles can a particular style emerge from its context, enabling its independence and unique significance to offer us the choice between alternatives.
this differentiation of styles bestows objectivity upon each individual style and the broader concept of style itself, removing its reliance on human subjects and their preferences.
the fragmentation of our cultural environment into multiple styles eradicates the original fusion of subject and object.
instead, we encounter a diverse array of expressive options, each governed by distinct norms, providing numerous avenues to express the entirety of life.
here, these expressive forms coexist alongside our subjectivity, with a symbiotic relationship characterized by chance encounters, harmonies, and discordances.
in a broad sense, this process describes the orbit wherein the significant process of objectifying modern culture is executed through the division of labor and specialization in both personal and objective contexts.
the overall scenario comprises these various phenomena, transforming cultural content into a progressively conscious objective mentality concerning not just consumers but also creators.
as this objectification intensifies, the peculiar phenomenon that initiated our exploration becomes more comprehensible: the cultural development of individuals can notably lag behind the cultural advancement of physical, functional, and intellectual objects.
after discussing how the evolution of the objective mind may surpass the subjective mind while also considering the possibility of the opposite scenario, i aim to revisit the importance of the division of labor in realizing the former situation.
put simply, the dual prospect arises as follows: the objectified mind, integrated into various production processes, tends to excel beyond the capabilities of a single individual due to the intricate nature of production methods that rely on numerous historical and material elements, predecessors, and collaborators.
consequently, the resulting product may encompass energies, attributes, and potentialities that far exceed the individual producer's scope.
this phenomenon is notably prevalent in modern technology, thanks to the division of labor.
when a product is crafted by a lone producer or through a somewhat unspecialized form of cooperation, the intellectual and physical essence embedded in it cannot significantly surpass that of the individuals involved.
it is the intricate division of labor that enriches an individual product with the collective energies of numerous individuals, resulting in a superior quality product in various aspects when considered as a whole compared to individual efforts.
this pooling of quality and excellence in the final product is limitless, unlike the finite natural limits of individual growth over time.
while the collaborative product captures diverse qualities from many contributors and offers extensive potential for enhancement, it lacks the perfection that can only arise from the amalgamation of energies originating from a single human entity.
this phenomenon is particularly evident in entities like the state, particularly in the context of modern society.
as much as they may surpass individual intellect in objective intellectual content and evolutionary potential, we still perceive them akin to a mere lifeless and soulless mechanism when differentiation and the number of cooperating factors increase.
the distinction between mind and soul becomes apparent in this context.
mind represents the objective content that the soul becomes conscious of as a functioning living entity.
the soul, on the other hand, acts as the structure that the mind - the logical and conceptual content of thought - takes on for our subjectivity, forming our subjectivity.
in this regard, the mind is not restricted to forming a unity essential for the existence of a soul.
it seems that the mental contents exist in a dispersed manner and it is only the soul that consolidates them into a unity, analogous to how inorganic matter integrates into an organism to sustain its unity of life.
the greatness and limitations of the soul become apparent when considering the individual contents of consciousness in terms of their independent validity and objective significance.
plato envisioned the realm of ideas as impeccably perfect and self-contained.
these ideas represent objective thoughts devoid of the biases of their actual representation, contrasting with the imperfect, conditioned, and ambiguous reflection of significant things in the human soul.
however, for us, the criteria for evaluating ideals and realities go beyond mere visual clarity and logical structure.
personal unity, stemming from understanding the intellectual essence of things, holds paramount importance.
it is within this unity that the grit and vigor of life come to fruition, along with the development of the ineffable warmth of emotions that find no place in the pristine clarity of solely objectively defined ideas.
the transition from an objectified mind to a subjective mind is crucial for all cultural communities, particularly in shaping their way of life.
the significance of style lies in its capacity to convey various contents in interconnected forms; thus, the relationship between the objective and subjective mind concerning quantity, size, and pace of development remains consistent, regardless of the cultural content.
the societal framework influences individual behavior by determining whether one's inner life aligns with or diverges from the cultural evolution of the era.
individuals might perceive this evolution, which they may only vaguely comprehend, as superior, or value their personal experiences over conventional, stereotypical thinking.
the current structure of this relationship is underpinned by the division of labor, which is closely intertwined with the money economy.
this is evident firstly because the fragmentation of the production process into numerous specialized tasks necessitates a meticulously organized system that relies on precise and dependable operations.
since the abolition of slave labor, this precision has only been achievable through compensating workers with wages.
any alternative form of exchange between employer and employee would introduce unforeseeable variables.
this is due to the challenges associated with providing and determining non-monetary compensation, as well as the fact that only a monetary relationship offers the necessary objectivity and automation essential for intricate and specialized organizational frameworks.
secondly, as production becomes increasingly specialized, the fundamental rationale behind the adoption of currency becomes more compelling.
economic transactions hinge on the principle that one party offers what another seeks, as long as the reciprocal action is reciprocated.
the principle of treating others as one would like to be treated is most clearly manifested in the realm of economics.
for instance, when a seller has a product a to offer but the potential buyer wants to exchange it with product b which the seller does not need, a medium of exchange is necessary.
this facilitates trade when the preferences of two individuals do not align with the products they possess.
therefore, if the parties cannot agree on a direct exchange, they can use money as an intermediary.
this allows the seller of a to acquire product c that they desire using the money received, while the buyer of a can obtain the necessary money by selling b through a similar transaction with a third party.
through this connection, the lifestyle, dependent on the interplay between objective and subjective culture, is closely linked to monetary transactions.
the essence of this connection becomes evident with monetary transactions symbolizing the dominance of the objective mind over the subjective mind, as well as the independent growth and empowerment of the subjective mind.
the prevailing influence of material culture over individual culture stems from the cohesive and self-sustaining nature achieved by objective culture in modern society.
production, along with its technology and advancements, appears as a structured cosmos with distinct and almost logical progressions that confront individuals similar to how destiny challenges the unpredictability of our will.
this formal autonomy and inherent compulsion, which molds cultural elements into a reflection of the natural environment, can only be realized through the use of money.
money exerts the most significant influence on aspects of our lives that are predominantly shaped by objective rather than subjective culture.
its historical power is highlighted by its ability to both support and contradict this tendency.
money shares similarities with language, as it can accommodate a wide range of thoughts and emotions.
while money is often seen as a neutral force, its impact on life can vary due to its interaction with the qualitatively determined contents and directions of life.
this interaction can lead to the creation of new and diverse forms.
the importance of money in shaping lifestyles is not diminished but enhanced by its ability to facilitate different relationships between objective and subjective perspectives.
hence, the totality of an object is understood through the combination of its attributes, which are comprehensible to us only when we attribute them with the unified identity of our own ego.
in this process, we perceive the potential for numerous characteristics and destinies to be linked to a singular entity.
this perception can also be applied, as has been proposed, to the concepts of energy and causality in relation to external objects: we project our own sensations of physical and mental tension, impulses, and voluntary actions onto these objects.
by placing these interpretive frameworks beyond their immediate appearance, we engage with them based on our emotional responses rooted in our inner selves.
this approach may lead us to encounter a contrasting dynamic once we delve into the essence of a deeper level beyond the initial symbolization of our inner life.
when we define a cognitive encounter as a connection of ideas, our comprehension is shaped by spatial concepts.
the simpler the mental and physical aspects of existence, the more they lend themselves to a mutual symbolizing interpretation.
through basic processes like association, fusion, and reproduction of ideas, we can recognize a universal law of form that requires a similar response from both the internal and external worlds, effectively connecting the two.
describing mental concepts using spatial analogies becomes progressively challenging as the ideas become more elaborate and distinct.
the validity then relies on its relevance to numerous instances to avoid seeming random and whimsical, striving to establish a secure, albeit symbolic, linkage to psychological reality.
as psychological reality delves deeper into understanding itself, grasping the essence and importance of things becomes increasingly intricate and uncertain, especially when dealing with intricate and specialized processes on both fronts.
the phenomena that form a unified series from this perspective include art, which i want to highlight first.
the inner meanings of different artistic styles stem from the varying degrees of distance they create between us and the objects.
art changes our initial perception of reality by altering our perspective.
it can bring us closer to reality, immersing us in its core meanings, revealing the spiritual essence behind the external world's apparent strangeness.
however, art also creates a distance from immediate experiences, allowing stimuli to fade away and creating a veil between us and the objects, akin to a soft bluish haze shrouding distant mountains.
both effects – drawing close and creating distance – have strong allure in this duality.
however, the concept symbolized by distance reaches beyond just aesthetics.
for example, the shift from philosophical materialism, which claimed direct apprehension of reality, to modern subjectivist or neo-kantian theories suggests that objects must first be filtered through the mind before they can be understood.
similarly, contemporary subjectivism aims, like art, to establish a more profound connection with objects by creating a perceived gap between ourselves and the external world.
this introspective self-awareness prompts a focus on our inner nature, leading to a newfound humility and a reluctance to overly simplify complex matters.
this trend is not limited to philosophical realms but extends to scientific fields and ethical considerations, where the conventional utility-based evaluation of volition is becoming less prominent.
the crucial function of money in this process begins with its role in overcoming geographical barriers.
it is vital to note that the conversion of values into money is what enables diverse parties with shared interests to connect regardless of physical distance.
for instance, a german capitalist and a german worker can both have direct stakes in a political reshuffle in spain, profits from african mining operations, and the outcome of a revolution in south america due to the use of money.
nevertheless, the more pivotal aspect lies in money's capacity to foster individual economic pursuits and influence.
this phenomenon leads to a reduction in familial bonds as each member pursues personal economic objectives, a characteristic unique to a monetary system.
most importantly, it allows for livelihoods to be built solely on individual skills and talents.
the ability to evaluate highly specialized tasks becomes feasible through the conversion of such tasks into their monetary equivalent, enabling their exchange.
money, by representing the value of tasks universally, facilitates interactions with external entities and integration into unfamiliar groups focused solely on the monetary worth of contributions.
in contrast, the family, operating on principles of collective ownership such as land ownership, emphasizes continuity and close relationships among its members.
the advent of a monetary economy, however, encourages a sense of detachment and individualism.
various aspects of contemporary life, besides family structures, are underpinned by the distancing effect introduced by financial transactions.
in modern urban life, a necessary internal barrier forms between individuals to cope with the bustling crowds and chaotic interactions of city living.
the constant proximity to countless others due to commercial, professional, and social engagement requires a level of psychological distance for sensitive and anxious individuals to manage.
without this sense of detachment brought about by the transactional nature of relationships in contemporary urban culture, people would feel overwhelmed by the sheer closeness and intensity of interactions.
the monetized aspect, whether overtly or subtly present, creates a subtle yet crucial boundary that offers a layer of protection and emotional detachment against the overwhelming closeness and conflicts inherent in our societal environment.
the more a person's contribution to a final product is reduced, the more their role seems like just a preliminary process, distancing them from the true meaning and purpose of their work.
to put it simply, money acts as an intermediary between individuals and commodities, separating the intrinsic value of the work from direct engagement.
in a monetary system, the direct connection to the tangible aspects of economic transactions is lost, and our focus is shifted to the monetary value, disconnecting us from the genuine significance of the objects.
as the importance of money grows, it creates a mental barrier that separates us further from the essence of things, halting our awareness of their intended purpose.
undoubtedly, the unique beauty and sentimental connection to nature may only truly manifest through this particular process.
those who reside closely with nature as their primary way of life can appreciate its allure from a subjective standpoint, yet they may lack the necessary emotional distance from nature required for aesthetic reflection.
this emotional detachment serves as the foundation for aesthetic contemplation, giving rise to a sense of melancholy yearning and a perception of a lost paradise, which are central to the romantic engagement with nature.
when contemporary individuals derive the greatest pleasure from nature in the snowy expanses of the alps or along the shores of the north sea, it is not solely driven by a desire for thrills or excitement.
this notion can also be attributed to the premise that the distant and unattainable nature of this isolated world serves as a profound magnification and refinement of our perception of nature's significance: a spiritual and remote ideal that remains elusive, an ideal perpetually out of reach even when physically nearby, a pledge that remains partially unfulfilled, and a presence that meets our fervent reverence with subtle opposition and unfamiliarity.
the emergence of landscape painting as an art form, reliant on distancing from its subject and a rupture in our inherent connection with it, has only evolved concurrently with the romanticized concept of nature in modern eras.
these developments are a consequence of the growing detachment from nature and the increasingly abstract lifestyle imposed by urbanization and the dominance of monetary transactions.
interestingly, this does not negate the reality that it is precisely wealth that affords us the opportunity to seek solace in nature.
initially, credit has evolved into a technical mode of transaction, potentially devoid of strong emotional implications.
secondly, the gradual accumulation of modest debts leading to the eventual settlement through a check fosters a sense of caution in the buyer towards the seller.
the usual face-to-face engagement characteristic of cash transactions is absent.
externally perceived, the act of delivering goods by the merchant now resembles a form of homage, a submission to authority that may be acknowledged, at least in specific instances, without a corresponding reciprocation.
as payments at the end of the credit term are conducted via a check rather than in person, routed through the impersonal medium of a bank account, this cautious demeanor endures among individuals.
the intricate network of purpose and consequences has led us to confront a fundamental paradox, where the goal is overshadowed by the methods employed: as the importance of the means grows, it paradoxically leads to a disregard and denial of the end.
this phenomenon is becoming more prevalent in society, affecting personal, political, and economic interactions on a broad scale and shaping the identity of specific age demographics and social groups.
it is acknowledged that humanity can influence nature to an extent for its benefit, but this influence predominantly applies to surface-level aspects of life.
in a broader context, if we take into account all aspects of life, the domination of nature through technology comes with a cost of becoming enslaved by it, forfeiting the essential role of spirituality in life.
the fallacies in this viewpoint are evident in the language and perspective used, which boast objectivity and a lack of myth but paradoxically demonstrate the opposite.
describing our relationship with nature as conquering or controlling is simplistic, suggesting a resistance or purposeful opposition from nature towards us.
however, nature is neutral and impervious to our attempts at control, as its inherent regularities remain unaffected.
as we have become enslaved by the production process, we have also found ourselves enslaved by the very products it produces.
technology, a conduit through which nature provides us with advancements, has led to a loss of self-reliance and spiritual depth in our lives.
this shift has resulted in the proliferation of endless habits, distractions, and superficial desires.
consequently, the control over means has not only influenced specific goals but has penetrated the core of our existence, the focal point from which all intentions stem and converge as ultimate objectives.
this alienation has created an impassable barrier of media, technical innovations, skills, and pleasures that separate man from his unique and fundamental essence.
in the current era, where technology overwhelmingly indicates a dominance of sharp intellectual awareness, both as a cause and a consequence, i have underscored that spirituality and reflection seem to experience a subtle sense of strain and undefined yearning in the midst of the loud grandeur of the scientific and technological era.
they perceive a distance from the essence of our existence, making it challenging to grasp it, and there is a persistent risk of drifting further away rather than towards it.
the role of money in this kind of lifestyle can be logically deduced from the discussions in this book.
it is important to note the dual role that money plays.
it is considered as part of the tools of culture that often overshadow and replace the true inner goals and objectives.
money symbolizes the senselessness and implications of the misplaced priorities, not only due to the strong desire for it but also because of its fleeting and temporary nature.
however, money is just one aspect among many other elements that create a disconnect between individuals and their objectives, albeit it does so more profoundly.
it is evident that money is not an isolated phenomenon, but rather the ultimate embodiment of these tendencies that manifest in various other aspects.
however, money plays a unique role as the driving force behind transformations in the series of purposes.
it intertwines with this sequence as the ultimate means, serving as the fundamental practical tool essential for the evolution of specific techniques in our society.
money's dual nature is evident in this context, as it embodies both an essential component within the spectrum of human existence and a superior, unifying force that underpins and influences each individual element.
similarly, just like religion, which can be seen as a competing interest in life, money has the potential to both integrate various aspects of life and exist independently above them.
the varying mating seasons among animals primarily stem from the need for offspring to be born during the most favorable seasons for feeding and climate conditions to support the young.
for instance, some primitive australian aboriginal groups, lacking domestic animals and often experiencing scarcity, time childbirths to specific periods annually.
as opposed to these natural rhythms, modern civilized societies, with their control over food and shelter, have gained greater independence, allowing individuals to choose their mating times based on personal preferences rather than biological imperatives.
consequently, the natural sexual variations have evolved into a more flexible and adaptable continuum.
when extending this analogy to economics and overall cultural aspects, it becomes more relatable.
in these spheres, the ability to purchase anything at any moment for a price means that individuals do not have to adhere to a specific rhythm to fulfill their emotional needs.
critics often criticize the existing economic system for oscillating between overproduction and crises, suggesting the need for a more seamless continuity between production and consumption.
this indicates that the current system is considered flawed and requires the establishment of a more consistent flow in economic activities.
i would like to highlight the advancements in transportation, from the limited mailcoach services of the past to today's seamless connections between key locations, as well as the instant communication made possible by telegraphs and telephones.
the development of artificial lighting has blurred the distinction between day and night, altering our natural daily rhythms.
the availability of printed literature offers us continuous access to diverse stimuli, irrespective of conventional time constraints for mental activity.
this shift implies that our activities and pleasures are no longer dictated by fixed time periods, but rather by personal will, ability, and logistical feasibility.
consequently, the traditional rhythms of life have been loosened, granting individuals greater freedom and flexibility in their pursuits.
rhythm can be described as the harmony of time, analogous to how symmetry represents harmony in space.
when representing rhythmic movements with lines, they exhibit symmetry, and the examination of symmetry implies a rhythmic concept.
both are distinct expressions of a fundamental theme.
rhythm caters to the auditory senses, while symmetry appeals to the visual senses in the initial stages of shaping raw materials.
to infuse objects with ideas, significance, and balance, they must be crafted symmetrically, with parts organized within the whole and distributed evenly around a central focal point.
consequently, the creative capacity of humans when faced with the disorder and randomness of natural elements is succinctly and visibly demonstrated.
symmetry serves as an initial demonstration of rationalism's ability to provide order amidst the chaos of existence and to embrace things as they are.
however, this also highlights the limitations in understanding and justifying this lifestyle.
the constraints are twofold: firstly, regarding the individual whose desires and necessities do not always align effortlessly with a predetermined structure, but rather occur sporadically and joyfully; and secondly, equally importantly, concerning the external world, which can only be awkwardly fit into such a simplistic framework.
while considering the diverse spheres of significance, one could express this as something of a paradox: nature does not conform to the symmetrical ideals of the mind, and conversely, the mind does not adhere to nature's symmetries.
the violence and inadequacies imposed on reality by a systematic approach are a product of the rigidity and symmetry in shaping the contents of existence.
on the other hand, as previously mentioned, a common pattern among individuals involves alternating periods of scarcity and moments of frivolous celebration, a cycle that has been eradicated in more technologically advanced economies.
while the stability of daily meals is typically achieved at high levels of development, it may not be as evident in the top echelons of society and intellect, who forego meals due to professional, social commitments, and various complex considerations.
the demands of circumstances and daily moods can similarly impact artists and scholars in this regard.
this correlation between meal times and work rhythms illuminates how different social strata exhibit distinct relationships.
in primitive societies, work and eating patterns are irregular, with bursts of energy driven by necessity or whim followed by random periods of idleness.
despite retaining strong rhythmic elements, modern factories have shifted to a different type of rhythms from earlier work settings.
the previous rhythms aligned with the physiological and psychological needs of workers, while contemporary rhythms are more about repeated motions necessary for tasks or the need for workers to sync with the overall workflow.
this shift may have led to a decline in the appreciation of rhythm.
similar to how old guilds fought for shorter work hours, modern trade unions now advocate for reduced working hours as well.
the evolution of money as an institution closely mirrors a particular pattern.
initially emerging amidst chaos and chance, money then progressed into a stage that embodied underlying principles and a coherent structure.
subsequently, as it advanced further, money acquired a sustained availability, allowing it to seamlessly adapt to various objective and personal needs without being confined by a rhythmic or serendipitous framework.
to demonstrate this transition from the second to the third stage, it is helpful to provide examples.
even as far back as the sixteenth century, in bustling cities like antwerp where numerous monetary transactions occurred, acquiring a substantial sum of money outside of regular fairs, where bills of exchange were traded, was exceedingly challenging.
moreover, if the businessman arranges for all his transactions to be conducted in cash, he will need to have a substantial amount of physical cash on hand for larger payments, but also possess the skill to make profitable investments during periods of high revenue.
utilizing large banks for financial transactions lessens the burden of managing cash flow since transactions can be handled through the clearing system.
by operating accounts within the same bank as his colleagues, the businessman can easily balance assets and debts by moving funds between accounts, minimizing the need for excessive cash reserves.
consequently, daily expenses can be managed with a modest amount of cash, and banks benefit from reduced cash holdings due to the offsetting nature of customer transactions.
to illustrate this further, let me provide one more example.
the fluctuating cycles of scarcity and abundance in a society with an underdeveloped money economy lead to corresponding fluctuations in the interest rates, ranging from very low to excessively high levels.
as the money economy evolves and becomes more stable, these fluctuations diminish, resulting in a more consistent interest rate environment.
consequently, even a 1% change in english discount rates holds considerable importance.
this increased stability allows individual businesses to adapt more easily, reducing their dependence on uncontrollable fluctuations and avoiding unfavorable business practices that were often necessitated by unstable conditions in the past.
thus, by sacrificing calculability and secure equilibrium, the narrower sense of lifestyle is also compromised.
life is not dictated by concepts that promote systematization and rigid patterns; instead, it emerges from unique components that may not adhere to the overall symmetry.
this lack of uniformity is often felt as a constraint rather than an appeal.
symmetry, essentially, lies in each element of a whole deriving its position, rationale, and importance from its relationship with other elements and a shared focal point.
we have noticed a strong connection between liberal constitutions and the money economy.
it is noteworthy that money can also be a powerful tool for despotism, allowing it to extend its influence to even the most remote areas that could otherwise become independent in a barter-based system.
england's individualistic society has thrived and risen to great power by nurturing its financial system.
furthermore, money not only plays a role in transforming liberalism into socialism dialectically but also serves as a direct influence, as specific monetary circumstances can act as a model for the social structure that socialism aims to create.
money is portrayed here as a facet within the vast spectrum of life forces.
its defining characteristic is its ability to transcend the conflicts present in its domain while simultaneously engaging in these conflicts by taking stances where it had previously been impartial or neutral.
a similar dynamic is observed in religion, which serves as a means for individuals to reconcile the disparities between their desires and their fulfillment, their ethical principles and their actions, and their idealized perceptions of the world versus reality.
when this reconciliation is achieved, religion transitions from its transcendent state to a more active involvement in the conflicts of existence it once harmonized.
religion embodies a comprehensive authority that surpasses the relative nature of human affairs, aligning itself with one side of the dualism it previously sought to harmonize.
in truth, the spirit is not only faced with a physical nature which allows it to truly understand its own essence, but also encounters spiritual elements of a lower nature such as evil, laziness, and enmity.
a metaphysical perspective like this does not see these traits as inherent to the spirit, which is viewed as the essential substance of existence.
instead, the spirit stands in contrast to all imperfect worldly aspects as an interested party, a harmonizing element, a distinctive value, even though the spirit, in its absolute form, encompasses all things.
this duality is most profoundly demonstrated in the concept of the self.
the individual who perceives the world engages with all the specific aspects of the world on an equal footing, regardless of the various qualities, distinctions, and conflicts present within the individual, almost as if they are personal matters.
money, on the other hand, provides its services impartially across a wide range of purposes within its domain.
unlike other forces that can turn specific once they deviate from their primary meaning, money maintains its general significance consistently.
it sustains the breadth of its general meaning by impartially aiding individuals in addressing disputes and resolving conflicts.
in reality, money's neutrality does not position it in a way that can be unfairly exploited by one party over another; rather, it inherently serves both sides from the inception of the conflict.
in contrast to universally shared resources like air and weapons, money stands out as a unique entity that transcends typical categories.
unlike air, which is equally essential to all living organisms, or weapons, which are utilized by conflicting parties, money holds a distinct position.
it exemplifies how, despite significant differences and conflicts in human society, commonalities and shared interests can still exist.
beyond this, money distinguishes itself in that, unlike other impartial entities, it does not remain detached from the purposes it serves.
despite its abstract nature and lack of inherent subjectivity or qualities, money, as a universal symbol of value, often exhibits a fascinating ability to align with and support the divergent goals and orientations of opposing factions.
the faster pace of social life resulting from an increased money supply becomes most evident when money's functional role is considered independently of its intrinsic value.
this acceleration of the overall economic activity is further heightened as it originates purely from within, especially noticeable in the speedy production of money.
this connection is illustrated by the observation that in rapidly developing economies, there is a tendency for a surge in the circulation of paper money.
an initial increase in the money supply within a country primarily impacts a specific group responsible for managing the excess money flow.
initially, prices of goods in competition with this group tend to rise, while other mass-consumed commodities remain affordable.
as more money enters circulation, efforts to stabilize prices are made, disrupting previous price relationships and causing households to adjust to these fluctuations.
ultimately, the uneven effects of money supply growth disrupt price stability, creating challenges for economically active individuals in interpreting the situation.
this leads to widespread differentiation experiences, shifts in existing price relationships, and calls for actions to restore balance.
the disparity in commodity prices causes certain individuals and professions to benefit from fluctuations in currency values, while others experience significant losses.
this was particularly evident among the peasantry in the past.
towards the late 17th century, english peasants, lacking knowledge and resources, found themselves caught between debtors who paid them face value and creditors who demanded payment by weight.
a similar situation occurred in india during currency devaluations, where farmers selling their harvest were uncertain if the proceeds would cover their rent or mortgages.
it is a well-established fact that wages are the last to adjust to rising prices, with the most vulnerable social groups receiving increased funds slowly and sparingly.
one primary reason for the disruptive impact of an increase in the money supply on society is its creation of additional disparities and divisions, both within individual family budgets and society as a whole.
this accelerates and deepens awareness levels.
conversely, a significant decrease in money supply would yield similar effects but in reverse.
the correlation between money and the pace of life is demonstrated by the varying distribution of money causing differentiation, breakdowns, irritations, and mental strain.
changes in the money supply serve as a reflection of the importance of money in the relationships between objects, shaping their psychic value.
money has led to new comparisons and valuations among objects.
we assess them in comparison to each other based on various criteria, including their usefulness, beauty, ethics, happiness-inducing quality, and the effort involved, considering numerous aspects of quantity and quality.
in doing so, we find that an object's identity within one relationship may contrast sharply with its lack of identity in another.
the monetary value assigned to them results in a unique equation and comparison that is not determined by other values, but rather reflects certain fundamental ideas that shape and blend with others.
each perspective of value that alters the traditional hierarchy of things offers new energy to their connections, hinting at undiscovered blends and connections, uncovering their similarities and disparities.
this reflects how our minds constantly strive to differentiate amidst uniformity.
the potential for consolidating values through money and money through its progressively abstract forms is mirrored by the potential for streamlining monetary transactions.
as a nation's economy increasingly hinges on money, financial activities gravitate towards major hubs of monetary exchanges.
historically, unlike rural areas, urban centers have always served as the focal points for monetary transactions, a trend also noticeable when comparing small towns to cities.
an english historian observed that throughout its history, while london never functioned as the heart of england but often as its intellect, it consistently operated as its financial hub.
likewise, it has been noted that towards the end of the roman republic, all funds spent in gaul were meticulously recorded in the ledgers of roman financiers.
the primary reason behind the emergence of financial centers lies in the inherent nature of money itself.
money serves as a medium for expressing value relationships among goods, yet unlike other commodities, the precise value of a specific amount of money is not easily determined independently; its value is only meaningful in comparison to the total amount in circulation.
consequently, the clustering of substantial amounts of money in one location, the perpetual competition it engenders, and the equilibrium established between supply and demand collectively contribute to a more accurate determination of its value and promote its efficient utilization.
while a unit of grain holds significance in any given location, regardless of its monetary worth, a unit of currency derives its importance solely from its relation to other values.
hence, for money to be fairly and reliably evaluated, it must intersect with a wide array of other values.
the transition mentioned, from larger to smaller coins and money orders, is pivotal in expediting transaction speeds, much like the rounding-off process, drawing a physical analogy.
the necessity for small denominations of money grows alongside transaction pace.
in 1844, an english banknote typically circulated for fifty-seven days before being redeemed, yet by 1871, this period reduced to just thirty-seven days.
contrasting the circulation speed of real estate with money vividly underscores the differing economic focal points across periods.
the dynamics of tax payments, influenced by external and internal variables based on the object of taxation, further exemplify the varied paces of economic activities.
by adopting such measures, taxation achieves a previously unprecedented level of flexibility and adaptability, resulting in significantly increased variability and annual fluctuations in individual contributions, yet ensuring a greater overall revenue stability.
the particular importance placed on land ownership or wealth in shaping societal norms might explain the high regard conservative societies hold for agriculture.
for example, the chinese firmly believe that agriculture is crucial for maintaining peace and ensuring the perpetuation of states.
to uphold this belief, a substantial tax is levied on land sales, prompting most transactions to occur discreetly and without official registration.
however, in situations where the fast-paced nature of economic activities driven by monetary transactions takes precedence, there is a push to align the traditional constraints of land ownership with the rapid pace of financial transactions.
in the 18th century, pennsylvania facilitated private land purchases through mortgages and allowed these debts to circulate as paper currency.
the contribution of money to the pace of life can be characterized by its specific nature and technical effects, as discussed earlier.
an in-depth examination of the concepts of constancy and change reveals a dual opposition in how they manifest.
when focusing on the essence of the world, we encounter the notion of an unchangeable being that implies absolute constancy, ruling out any fluctuations in things.
however, when considering the formation of this essence, constancy gives way to continuous transformation, as one form evolves into another, presenting the world as a perpetual motion machine.
this dual perspective, when approached from an empirical or metaphysical standpoint, highlights the contrasting interplay between constancy and flux.
when we initially perceive the world around us, we notice certain enduring forms despite the constant movement of their underlying elements.
for instance, a rainbow remains visible even as water particles shift positions, and an organic structure maintains its shape despite the continuous exchange of its materials.
in inorganic objects, only the relationships and interactions of their smallest components endure, while the components themselves are constantly in molecular motion beyond our perception.
while reality is continuously in flux, our inability to perceive this perpetual change causes the forms and patterns of movement to solidify into what we perceive as stable entities.
money symbolizes the rapidly changing nature of the world in a profound way.
its essence lies in its circulation rather than in being hoarded.
when money is stagnant, it loses its value and significance.
even when at rest, its dormant state hints at the imminent movement it will soon experience.
money serves as a conduit for relentless movement, erasing any notion of stability.
it can be likened to pure action, in constant self-transformation from one state to another, opposing and negating all forms of static existence.
however, it may also symbolize the converse concept of defining reality.
money, by its very essence, is continuously in flux due to its connection to various objects of value, similar to how general laws relate to specific circumstances in which they manifest.
even though the law, transcending all movements, embodies the form and foundation of every movement, abstract wealth value, unified by money rather than individual values, acts as the essence and objective of economic endeavors.
while money is fleeting in the practical world, its essence serves as the most enduring element by functioning as the point of equilibrium among all other phenomena.
the concept that a specific institution equally engages with the two fundamental realities could clarify the connection between these forms.
their importance is relatively intertwined, where each discovers its logical and psychological potential for making sense of the world in the other.
the assertion of the ideal system of perpetually valid laws exists because reality is constantly evolving.
conversely, our understanding and grasp of the flux of existence, which would otherwise fall into utter chaos, is only possible due to the presence of such enduring laws.
the world's general relativity, initially seemingly identifiable with just one side of this duality, actually encompasses the other side and emerges as the dominant force where it seemed at first only a participant.
similarly, money surpasses its role as a mere economic unit to symbolize abstract economic value overall, melding both functions in an inseparable relationship where neither takes precedence.
money, functioning as an institution within the context of history, embodies the interaction of objects and establishes a unique connection with them.
as societal interactions become increasingly driven by monetary transactions, the subjective nature of existence becomes more apparent in conscious thought because money essentially represents the relative value of economic goods in a tangible form.
just as the absolutist perspective reflects a distinct stage of intellectual growth corresponding to practical, economic, and emotional circumstances, the relativistic worldview appears to articulate the ongoing process of intellectual adaptation.
this is further evidenced by contrasting depictions of social and individual experiences, where money serves as a tangible representation and symbolic reflection of its various forms and movements.

this compilation of works has its roots in the research conducted over the last five decades in text-focused computing within the humanities, as highlighted by susan hockey in this publication.
it originated from father roberto busa's pioneering efforts in adapting early computing to analyze and categorize texts as seen in the creation of the index thomisticus, a concordance to st.
a quick look at the contents of this companion reveals the field's expansive scope today.
while maintaining a core interest in textual analysis, advancements in technology have enabled the field to incorporate a wide array of multimedia.
since the 1990s, the digital humanities field has evolved significantly, especially with the emergence of the world wide web.
despite this broadening reach, its fundamental goal has remained constant: leveraging information technology to shed light on human history and leveraging insights from human history to shape the development and application of information technology.
many fields have progressed from merely aiming to conserve these artifacts, which could be considered primitive data management techniques, to reinterpreting and analyzing them to uncover characteristics and features that were not originally apparent.
in addition, the realm of digital humanities has expanded to involve the development of new artifacts that originate in digital format, necessitating thorough scrutiny and comprehension in their unique context.
the digital humanities community widely believes in a strong connection between the interpretive approaches used by humanists and the tools that enable the exploration of primary artifacts guided by these approaches.
simply put, digital humanities scholars value the practical application of theory just as much as the theoretical framework itself.
consequently, core activities typically linked with humanities computing view digital preservation of archival materials as equally significant as conducting analysis or critical investigation, in conjunction with theories derived from studying these materials.
the editors aimed for this collection to be a historical documentation of the field, showcasing the evolution of digital humanities over the past fifty years and its current state.
upon examining the core themes across the contributions, one can discern a forward-looking perspective on the future of digital humanities.
not only does this volume highlight the progress and ongoing innovations in the field, but it also underscores how digital humanities is reshaping fundamental research paradigms and methodologies in various disciplines.
by emphasizing crucial inquiries and exploring novel approaches facilitated by our engagement with computers, digital humanities offers a fresh outlook on important questions and methodologies.
exploring the history of any interdisciplinary academic field involves addressing several fundamental inquiries.
defining the area's scope, analyzing its relationship with related disciplines, and assessing its influence on more traditional fields are crucial aspects.
while a linear chronology may capture the evolution of the field to some extent, deviations from this narrative might open up uncharted territories worth exploring.
each of these inquiries has the potential to spark in-depth discussions.
however, for the purpose of this discussion, the focus will be on presenting a chronological overview of the evolution of humanities computing.
this narrative will spotlight pivotal moments of intellectual advancement within the field and instances where humanities computing has significantly impacted or been adopted by other disciplines.
defining humanities computing is not the purpose of this essay.
the wide array of topics covered in this companion reflects the essence of the field.
in essence, humanities computing focuses on applying computing to research and education in the broad spectrum of subjects known as "the humanities" or "the arts" in british english.
notably, the core of humanities computing has revolved around applications involving textual sources, a defining aspect emphasized in major publications.
consequently, this essay naturally emphasizes this aspect.
while not delving into defining "interdisciplinarity" here, it is evident that humanities computing inherently merges "the two cultures," blending the systematic procedures synonymous with the sciences with the humanities' traditionally more serendipitous approach to problem-solving.
a sign of an emerging discipline is often the establishment of a new academic journal.
computers and the humanities was founded in 1966 and was spearheaded by joseph raben.
raben played a pivotal role in nurturing the journal during its initial years when formal conferences and associations were not yet established.
consequently, computers and the humanities served as a primary platform for sharing information about humanities computing.
the journal's directory of scholars active, curated by raben, soon became a vital resource for individuals contemplating the initiation of new projects in the field.
additionally, other specialized newsletters, such as calculi for computers and classics edited by stephen waite, catered to specific communities within the discipline.
if one word could encapsulate this era, it would undoubtedly be "consolidation." during this time, an increasing number of individuals adopted methodologies that had been established in the earlier period.
the production of electronic texts surged, along with the initiation of numerous projects utilizing the same applications.
awareness of the potential capabilities had disseminated steadily through traditional scholarly communication channels.
as computers became more ubiquitous in everyday life, more people started contemplating the ways in which computers could enhance their research and teaching endeavors.
the personal computer has become an essential tool in academic circles, yet during its inception, it was notably more costly.
early buyers were mainly tech enthusiasts or individuals well-versed in computing.
in the realm of humanities computing, its introduction eliminated the need to rely on computer centers for access.
personal computer users had the freedom to operate independently without necessarily leveraging existing expertise.
while this led to some duplication of work, it also spurred innovation by allowing users to explore new possibilities unconstrained by existing norms.
by the late 1980s, three dos-based text analysis programs - wordcruncher, tact, and microocp - had gained popularity for their advanced features.
users of personal computers found these programs useful for various purposes.
wordcruncher and tact provided quick search results, while microocp employed batch concordance for its mainframe program.
despite these advancements, word processing remained the primary use of personal computers, attracting a broader user base who were largely unfamiliar with other applications and often overlooked the full potential of computers beyond word processing capabilities.
the humanist electronic discussion list has set a high standard among similar platforms, with mccarty ensuring top-notch editing and fostering insightful discussions.
in europe, receiving three to six humanist digests in the early morning has become a cherished part of the daily routine.
the list plays a central role in nurturing a community and has been instrumental in shaping the field of humanities computing.
with archives dating back to 1987, it serves as a valuable resource for tracking developments and issues over the years.
its success has inspired the creators of the linguist list, a prominent online forum in linguistics.
the tei's size, reach, and impact went beyond the expectations set during the vassar meeting.
it marked the inaugural comprehensive effort to classify and delineate all attributes present in humanities texts that could capture scholars' attention.
a total of about 400 encoding tags were outlined in a framework that allowed for seamless expansion into new domains.
the specifications of these tags in the guidelines shed light on some of the encountered challenges, while deeper intellectual complexities surfaced during the project's evolution.
engaging with the tei spurred an exploration of markup theory and the portrayal of humanities knowledge as a standalone field.
the release of the tei guidelines coincided with advancements in full-text digital libraries, prompting digital library initiatives, previously unacquainted with humanities computing, to adopt the tei as the foundation for their projects instead of creating a new markup system from scratch.
a significant amount of the tei project's tasks were conducted via email by utilizing both private and public discussion lists.
additionally, drafts of documents were uploaded to a fileserver for collaborative editing.
following the project's inception, active participation in a tei group necessitated regular use of email, making the project an interesting case study of this communication method.
nonetheless, participants soon recognized the challenges of reaching consensus solely via email discussions.
fortunately, funding allowed for a consistent schedule of in-person technical meetings, ensuring timely decision-making and effective streamlining of markup proposals from various working groups.
in addition to the significant advancements in personal computing, networking, and the text encoding initiative (tei), the activities in humanities computing that originated in the 1970s saw continued growth with an increased number of users and projects.
over time, specific application areas evolved from humanities computing and established their unique culture and pathways for spreading information.
the topic of "computers and writing" quickly faded away, while a notable shift occurred in linguistic computing, especially corpus linguistics, as it began to have its own dedicated conferences and meetings.
despite efforts by don walker within the tei steering committee to bridge humanities computing and computational linguistics, computational linguistics persisted as a distinct discipline with antonio zampolli from the institute for computational linguistics in pisa.
though walker and zampolli endeavored to unite the two communities, their success may have been limited.
the increased accessibility of electronic resources through the web resulted in a growing interest in humanities computing.
scholars began studying electronic resources as subjects of analysis, even if they lacked technical expertise.
among various forms of electronic resources, hypertext garnered significant attention from theorists, expanding the scope of discussions in humanities computing.
however, this shift also led to some misunderstandings about the practical aspects of creating and utilizing these resources.
this situation revived the divide between those actively involved in the process and those who preferred discussing it, highlighting issues between the two cultural perspectives.
the rise of academic programs signifies the growing recognition of a subject area within the academic community.
in the case of humanities computing, this trend began in the late 1990s.
interestingly, only a few programs actually use the term "humanities computing" in their titles.
for instance, king's college london offers a ba minor in applied computing integrating humanities disciplines, along with an ma program named ma in applied computing at the centre for humanities computing.
mcmaster university in canada provides a ba in multimedia, while the upcoming ma program at the university of virginia is named digital humanities and falls under the media studies program.
the university of alberta appears to be the first to incorporate "humanities computing" into the program title, although the university of glasgow has offered an mphil in history and computing for an extended period.
the primary task of an archaeologist involves locating and excavating the material remnants left by past civilizations to extract valuable information from them.
this process of uncovering historical artifacts requires a systematic approach to maximize the insights they offer.
whether through excavation or surface survey, the unveiling of these remains unavoidably involves the destruction of the initial evidence.
sometimes, this destruction is profound and total, such as when digging through one layer to reveal another.
frequently, it involves extracting objects from their original contexts, potentially losing essential information about their physical and chronological placement.
preserving accurate records becomes crucial in mitigating inadvertent data loss due to the intrusive nature of archaeological work.
it can be contended that meticulous documentation stands as the primary task of a field archaeologist.
the significance of context for archaeologists underscores the necessity of maintaining meticulous records.
detailed documentation of not just the archaeological contexts and artifacts but also various other aspects of excavations or surveys is essential for analysis.
these records play a critical role, and the potential benefits of using computers for record-keeping are evident today.
it may not be immediately apparent that if computers are employed to document the fundamental information crucial for constructing archaeological interpretations, all professionals must eventually possess the ability to utilize computers to access this data.
in essence, proficiency in computers and computer skills will become imperative for all archaeologists if a significant portion of the archaeological record is preserved in digital format.
the potential of computers for record-keeping has become evident over time.
however, during the late 1950s when archaeologists initially adopted computers, they were considered complex and unfamiliar tools.
due to high costs and limited accessibility, academics couldn't fully harness their record-keeping capabilities as affordable microcomputers were not yet available.
data input involved punch cards or tape, with outcomes being produced solely on paper.
consequently, computers were primarily utilized for demanding processing tasks rather than routine data storage.
early applications focused on statistical processing, leveraging the computers' capacity to perform more intricate statistical procedures than previously achievable manually in archaeology, where statistics had been employed for years.
the challenges stemming from the differences in terminology and data structures have been magnified by the distinct requirements of the archaeological community and museum specialists.
when archaeologists document excavated artifacts, they typically start with excavation context, whereas museum curators tend to classify based on cultural or object-oriented systems.
consequently, the databases used by these two groups are structured in divergent ways, hindering seamless collaboration on a broader scale.
although it may not be feasible to merge different datasets in the short term, it is crucial to prioritize the preservation of datasets for future retrieval.
archaeologists now have access to digital repositories that actively support the long-term safeguarding of their data files, highlighting the critical duty of preserving digital data.
the recovered artifacts and their associated data serve as the primary remaining evidence of fieldwork, with neither component holding complete significance without the other.
furthermore, it can be suggested that ongoing economic progress may limit opportunities for excavations and field surveys, potentially leading to future archaeology revolving around excavations in museum archives and historical records.
initially, archaeologists commonly utilized cad programs primarily for drafting assistance, regarding the computerized drawings as the end result.
this allowed them to create plans and elevations at different scales with varying focuses without the need for laborious redrawing.
nevertheless, precise dimensional data could still be obtained from the cad file in its original accuracy, irrespective of the drawing scale.
additionally, the computer data could be segmented to incorporate or exclude specific phases or elements from the overall digital file into any given drawing.
consequently, over time, cad data became acknowledged as more comprehensive and intricate than individual drawings.
the significance of cad extended to its capacity to document in three dimensions and produce drawings based on the complete 3-d geometry of a site or structure.
with advancements in database technology during the 1960s and 1970s, archaeologists could effectively record the additional information they were discovering with precision, using cad to capture 3-d data effortlessly while maintaining the accuracy of original field measurements.
the accessibility of sophisticated surveying tools, such as the total station and desktop photogrammetry, simplified the collection of 3-d data.
the combined 3-d capabilities of cad and advanced surveying equipment have facilitated the creation of intricate 3-d models as archaeological records.
these models encompass the entire geometry, allowing for the retrieval of all dimensions with surveyed precision.
moreover, the 3-d models can be segmented to customize on-screen views or paper drawings by including or excluding specific sections based on immediate requirements.
archaeologists predominantly use cad models for reconstructing, illustrating, or envisioning the past, prioritizing appearances over precise dimensions.
by utilizing simpler, idealized dimensions in the computer-aided designs of buildings or larger ensembles, they can create visually appealing and cost-effective representations.
to illustrate reconstructed realities effectively, archaeologists often depend on supplementary technologies like rendering programs or virtual reality programs that build upon the cad models as their foundation.
challenges specific to archaeology arise that pose complexities in utilizing various technologies.
one such challenge is the disparity in terminology, which hinders the seamless sharing of data across these technologies, as previously discussed in relation to databases.
moreover, the application of cad and gis technologies in recording data by archaeologists differs significantly from what software developers envisioned.
the standards set by developers are often inadequate for scholarly users, and the progress in establishing scholarly standards has been sluggish and lacking direction.
the archaeology data service in england has been instrumental in addressing these issues, offering guidelines on best practices for scholars.
in the past, early archaeological research involved scholars writing their own programs for computing, but this practice is no longer essential.
nowadays, most scholars rely on commercial software for their work.
however, specific archaeological challenges such as certain statistical methods and seriation procedures still motivate archaeologists to develop their own programs.
simulation remains a critical area that necessitates programming skills.
in the 1960s, using computers for simulating the development of simpler societies showed great potential, but as interest in the "new archaeology" declined, so did the attraction towards simulation.
presently, those interested in simulation are more inclined to use gis, cad, or statistics to compare different predefined scenarios for testing potential developmental explanations, rather than utilizing simulation or artificial intelligence algorithms, which have been scarcely used in archaeology.
it is not guaranteed that future archaeologists will have the capability to effectively utilize the digital data generated during fieldwork today.
unfortunately, individuals proficient in such technologies often have to teach themselves, whereas it would be more beneficial for them to learn from experts who are familiar with the potential challenges.
the issue of inexperienced or self-taught users of computer technology is not widely acknowledged within the field of archaeology, perhaps because archaeologists have not realized the importance of all professionals being able to access digital data from computer databases, cad models, or gis datasets.
the lack of formal training poses a significant barrier to both the efficient utilization of computer technology and the reuse of existing digital data.
in this context, the discipline encompasses not only educators and students involved in sharing and acquiring knowledge, as well as curators responsible for managing resources like slides, but also personnel at museums and galleries entrusted with the preservation and curation of extensive collections, often exceeding display capacity.
it is crucial to acknowledge that various historians rely on and utilize historical images, a point evident in the diverse array of participants attending conferences.
particularly in sizable collections, computers were swiftly acknowledged as indispensable for organizing frequently insufficient paper records, benefiting curators, conservators, registrars, and eventually, the wider public.
could the emergence of the web signal a shift towards a diminished role for campus-based universities and physical museums and galleries?
given the limitation of gallery space that allows only a fraction of their collections to be showcased, perhaps directing funding towards web-based image databases would be more beneficial.
while there is widespread recognition of the value of in-person seminars and tutorials, the traditional fixed-location lectures may fade away due to the allure of web-based, visually rich alternatives and the financial constraints that prevent some students from physically attending.
the key challenge lies in ensuring that online "lectures" match or surpass the quality of traditional ones.
by leveraging digital imagery, which owes its development in part to photography, art history's reach and cultural significance could potentially be amplified globally, especially in a digitally interconnected age.
although there might be a desire to downplay classical computing's role in future history as a distinct entity, classicists have had to establish their own historical narrative.
even in optimistic scenarios where classicists adapt existing tools and collaborate extensively with other disciplines, they will still face significant challenges in ensuring their perspectives are acknowledged and that upcoming technologies and norms cater to their requirements.
this section aims to elucidate the rationale behind classicists shaping their unique historical trajectory and connecting present patterns with a broader historical backdrop.
while critiquing the past is straightforward, this chapter not only scrutinizes historical events but also uses them to support projections for the future, thereby justifying any biases in hindsight by revealing its predictions for upcoming developments.
our lack of technical expertise became apparent when harvard initiated its computing project in the summer of 1982.
this inexperience turned out to be advantageous, as a more knowledgeable approach may have deterred the department from proceeding, waiting for technology to advance.
instead, the department committed significant resources that made it difficult to halt the project.
ultimately, our focus on addressing specific challenges in classical typesetting led to cost reductions for publications like harvard studies in classical philology and the loeb classical library.
this success justified the initial investment, but the process itself was flawed.
despite the satisfactory outcomes, our achievements were tempered by our good fortune, considering the common challenges encountered by similar projects in the field of classics and academia at large.
initially, our access to email was confined to our individual computer; it wasn't until we connected to a network named uucp that we could exchange emails between computers.
however, this came with challenges as our computer would significantly slow down each time it handled mail.
additionally, email wasn't particularly useful back then as very few individuals outside our circle had email accounts.
we also struggled with basic file transfers as the concept of the present-day internet would have appeared far-fetched to us.
being on the forefront of technological advancements elicited contradictory feelings, vacillating between optimism and skepticism.
during the late 1960s and early 1970s, historians perceived a significant impending shift within their profession, the field of history itself.
this transformation was evident through a series of unmistakable signs.
it sparked a culture clash within the discipline, leading to a wave of intense conference discussions, public debates, and roundtables featuring titles like "the muse and her doctors" and "the new and the old history." this clash pitted the "new" history, heavily influenced by social science theories and methodologies, against the traditional narrative approaches of historians.
the "new" historians employed computers to conduct analyses and draw connections never before explored, yielding occasionally astounding outcomes.
fueled by success and exuberance, and perhaps bordering on overconfidence, these historians were reluctant to entertain opposition to their findings or methods.
encountering challenges at conferences, some historians simply responded with mathematical equations.
prominent british social historian lawrence stone criticized the efforts and expenses associated with the emerging field of new history, stating that the most generously financed projects that involved extensive data collection, dedicated teams of researchers, advanced computer technology for analysis, and sophisticated mathematical presentations have been the most underwhelming.
these views continue to resonate within the discipline, reflecting profound disagreements regarding the practical approach and methodology in historical studies.
looking back, historians have utilized computing technologies in three distinct phases.
the first phase, dating back to the 1940s, featured pioneers like owsley, curti, and aydelotte who were instrumental in the initial adoption of quantitative history.
these historians employed mathematical techniques and constructed extensive datasets.
the second phase emerged in the early 1960s within the realm of social science history, focusing on the "new" social, economic, and political history with an emphasis on themes such as mobility, political alignment, urbanization, assimilation patterns, and legislative behavior.
notable figures during this phase included lee benson and allan bogue from the "iowa school" of quantification, alongside historians like olivier zunz, michael f.
morgan kousser, and others who employed various statistical methods.
the emergence of the pc revolution and the internet, combined with the continuous growth in speed and disk capacity of computing technology following moore's law, ushered in the third phase.
in this present era, the networking capabilities of the internet present historians with significant opportunities as well as challenges.
simultaneously, the internet has established an extensive network of systems and data, while personal computers and software have progressed to the extent that almost every historian now integrates information technologies into their daily workflow.
throughout the 1980s, historians in europe advanced the utilization of databases for historical computing.
during this period, they raised questions about the impact of these tools on their interpretations and whether relational database models were capable of accommodating non-tabular data like lengthy texts, sound, images, and maps.
manfred thaller introduced a system that aimed to distinguish the "knowledge environment" from the software or system environment, ensuring that the meaning of database records remained detached from their source information.
the development of databases for historical computing prompted thaller and other quantitative historians to differentiate between designs based on the method of analysis/model and those built around the data sources.
the former involved historians extracting information from sources and organizing it into tables conducive to anticipated queries.
conversely, the latter method focused on preserving the original textual or data content along with its complete source context, deferring decisions on data analysis and organization until later stages.
as historians debated the merits of quantitative methods and embraced cultural studies, computer scientists were concurrently developing a standardized language for sharing files online.
the emergence of the world wide web in 1993, marked by the introduction of html and web browsers, provided historians with a novel platform to showcase their research.
among the early scholars to recognize the potential of the web for academic purposes was edward l.
ayers from the university of virginia.
ayers, while studying two american communities during the civil war, transitioned his research from traditional distribution methods to online publication upon encountering the emerging possibilities offered by the mosaic institute for advanced technology in the humanities at his university.
the valley of the shadow project was initially perceived as simply a collection of civil war letters, records, and accounts by the general public.
however, students and teachers appreciated its role in providing them access to the past and allowing them to become their own historians.
while scholars were initially skeptical about the value of an electronic archive, gradually historians, including prominent figures like james m.
mcpherson, started to take notice of the project.
some historians viewed it as a disruptive innovation that had the potential to alter established historical narratives.
in a notable conference panel on the valley project, mcpherson, a renowned civil war historian, expressed concerns about the project's narrow focus and argued that the selected communities did not adequately represent the north and south.
edward ayers made a crucial decision early on to develop the valley of the shadow project for the world wide web, which played a vital role in its ongoing success.
although the team at the university of virginia, in collaboration with ayers, also created cd-roms and ayers is preparing a narrative book based on the electronic archive, the website stands out as the centerpiece with millions of users and is the focal point for all other scholarly materials.
the cd-rom versions of the valley of the shadow and who built america?
contained valuable content, but their closed systems and offline nature limited their impact, especially as technology rapidly progressed in the late 1990s.
in contrast, the world wide web provided the connectivity and hypertext capabilities that appealed to the growing public demand and scholars, who recognized its significant advantages.
ayers noted that historians could harness these new media possibilities by exploring innovative ways to craft narrative forms on paper that capture the intricate nature depicted in digital archives.
in his discussion, darnton highlighted middle east studies as a prime example of a marginalized area of academic research that garnered little public interest.
mere years following darnton's analysis, the pivotal events of september 11, 2001, propelled middle east studies into the forefront of american consciousness.
he astutely noted that the uncertain market dynamics, coupled with mounting pressures on academic publishers, tenure processes, and scholars, posed significant challenges to the longevity of scholarly books.
ayers and the author are collaborating on an electronic article for the american historical review titled "the differences slavery made: a close analysis of two american communities." this digital scholarly piece serves multiple purposes by bridging form and analysis.
one key feature is its ability to guide readers through the evolutionary process of our argument, enabling them to trace the rationale behind our insights, akin to the envisioned "trails" by vannevar bush for historians utilizing technology.
additionally, this innovative scholarship incorporates spatial analysis and presentation to situate both its subjects and audience within the historical backdrop and interpretation.
moreover, it is designed to foster unexpected linkages with forthcoming research, enhancing its enduring relevance and impact on the scholarly community.
the work combines interpretative argument with the digital resources available through the valley of the shadow project, envisioning a forthcoming era of interconnected scholarly practices where interpretation, narrative, evidence, commentary, and other academic endeavors are intertwined.
the resulting work aims to meld structure and argument within the digital landscape.
the authors advocate for a prismatic model as a departure from darnton's traditional pyramid framework, enabling readers to explore multiple facets of interpretation based on shared evidence and historiographical context.
this article's prismatic approach invites readers to engage with historical interpretation through sequential and interlinked analyses, evidence, and their connections to prior scholarship.
equally significant, the article leverages its structure to elucidate its argument and subject matter.
the narrative underscores that slavery is not defined by a singular determinant but possesses multifaceted effects that permeate all aspects of society.
the thresor was initially made available online in 1994 as an interactive database through the artfl project at the university of chicago.
the ascii data files were later adapted to operate within the philologic program.
by the year 2000, the dictionnaires d'autrefois from artfl were integrated into a server located at the inalf in nancy, utilizing the stella interactive database software.
simultaneously, in 2000, the thresor was also launched as an interactive database on a windows server housed at the university of toronto.
this system operated under tactweb, with the data files initially undergoing indexing by tact within an ibm-compatible environment.
the idea of thorough testing, free from personal biases and interpretations, hinges on the belief that computerized methods can pinpoint and extract textual characteristics accurately.
when automation is not feasible, rigorous steps must be taken to prepare texts accordingly.
a significant advantage of many electronic literary studies is their foundation on a theoretical framework of textuality that scrutinizes the critic's role and the text's unique features, ensuring the criteria employed in analysis are well-grounded.
the distinction of these textual characteristics often requires them to be separated from the rest of the text, with markup serving as the most evident form of "external intervention." the role of markup is crucial in literary examination of electronic texts, as the interpretative process by the critic is essential due to the inherent ambiguity of meaning in literature even before the actual analysis begins.
words presented as distinct sets of characters, sentences, lines, and paragraphs represent "natural" textual elements but are not without value.
the utilization of thematic markup for disambiguation stems directly from a critic’s interpretation of the text, thereby shaping the analysis.
numerous computer-based studies have emphasized that transparently disclosing the criteria used to encode specific textual attributes is vital for any method striving to yield measurable outcomes.
despite the hesitancy of most literary critics to adopt electronic media for scholarly analysis, literary computing has not significantly influenced mainstream scholarship.
in contrast, electronic scholarly editions have been widely embraced in the academic community and are recognized as essential resources for teaching and research.
despite the abundance of electronic texts with advanced markup, their availability has not resulted in a notable uptick in computer-based studies.
considering these technical challenges, it appeared that with the removal of hardware limitations and the readiness of computing systems to handle scholarly computing requirements, the electronic analysis of literature would emerge as a significant research area.
issues related to research methodologies in studies that aimed to undertake more complex tasks but were hindered by technical constraints, such as the need for extensive datasets, access to diverse texts, and sufficient computing capacity to analyze lengthy texts for specific patterns, primarily stemmed from technological limitations.
emphasizing the importance of computer-assisted studies aligning themselves with current scholarly trends, exploring theoretical aspects related to text and textuality, and illustrating to non-specialists that the outcomes warrant further investigation is crucial.
utilizing computers goes beyond mere novel tools, as they can enhance a critic's work by providing insights inaccessible to human readers.
the electronic tool's strengths lie in its speed, accuracy, vast memory capacity, and instant access to all textual elements.
by leveraging expanding knowledge resources and establishing connections between texts to create extensive repositories of material, traditional literary criticism stands to greatly benefit from the insights and expertise gained through computer-based investigations towards a more rigorous analysis of literature.
since its inception, humanities computing has consistently displayed a multifaceted nature concerning literary genres, socio-cultural contexts, and the historiogeographical origins of literary works.
research has delved into various forms of literature such as poetry, drama, and narratives spanning from ancient times to contemporary pieces.
while there is a notable focus on english literature, texts in other languages have also been scrutinized.
the strength of these studies lies in the diverse methodologies employed to analyze varied textual materials, drawing from a wide range of theoretical frameworks and literary models.
rather than adhering to a specific technique or school of thought, these studies share a common tool, fostering a rich and inclusive research environment.
contemporary investigations often delve into literary theory, text analysis, and the interdisciplinary aspects of computer-aided literary studies.
mainstream literary criticism has embraced contributions from this field, which maintains a keen awareness of its theoretical underpinnings.
over the past two decades of the 20th century, music notation software has advanced significantly.
composers can now create their own music without relying on professional copyists.
previously, individual parts had to be copied manually from the score.
with this technology, complex ensemble pieces requiring a conductor's score and individual musicians' parts can now be created quickly and cost-effectively.
once the main score is inputted into the computer, the software can automatically generate the parts with minimal manual intervention.
this software is extensively used in the music publishing field and enables musicologists to produce precise, efficient, and cost-effective scholarly editions of works.
the term "multimedia" initially denoted artworks integrating various traditional art media, such as in multimedia art installations.
however, when defining multimedia as "computer-based," it purposefully eliminates such mixed-media creations.
essentially, a multimedia piece is a digital creation accessed through a computer, even if some components were initially crafted in analog form and then digitized for computer integration.
this classification also rules out pieces generated on a computer, like a desktop publishing file, but indirectly experienced by audiences through an analog medium such as print.
these examples serve as illustrations of different types of multimedia.
establishing a suitable taxonomy would revolve around specific criteria.
for instance, one approach could involve categorizing multimedia content based on its intended purpose, distinguishing between entertainment and educational content.
another aspect to consider could be the methods of distribution and consumption contexts, ranging from freely accessible websites demanding a high-speed internet connection to high-end cd-rom games necessitating cutting-edge video cards for optimal performance.
additionally, multimedia could be classified based on the blend of different media elements, such as remixes combining music with synchronized textual annotations or immersive virtual environments for exploration.
furthermore, other classification criteria may include the production technologies employed, the sensory modes activated, the originating organization, or the level of interactivity provided.
the practice of digitization leads to the creation of multimedia, which involves combining various media to form rhetorically persuasive works.
computer-based media are characterized by their interactive potential, notably seen in the elaborate systems designed by interactive game developers.
consequently, the emerging field of digital game criticism plays a crucial role in examining computer games as significant elements of popular culture and rhetoric within multimedia.
this discipline delves into questions such as what defines a game, how games can be viewed as art forms, what defines an effective and engaging game, and what opportunities exist for interactive engagement through digital platforms.
interactive gaming stands out as a quintessential form of multimedia and a primary mode of expression in the contemporary digital era.
there are two approaches to understanding multimedia.
the first involves examining it through definitions, histories, examples, and theoretical challenges.
the second approach entails using multimedia for thinking and communication.
the academic analysis of multimedia typically involves a critical examination of the subject, conveyed through academic mediums such as textbooks, articles, and lectures.
"thinking-with" multimedia involves applying multimedia to ponder concepts and convey them effectively.
working with multimedia involves its distinct conventions of dialogue, organizational methods, tools, and results.
engaging with multimedia aids in exploring ideas and expressing them.
in a dynamic field like multimedia, where novel ideas are prevalent, thinking with multimedia is crucial.
scholars in the multimedia field must embrace the task of utilizing multimedia to contemplate multimedia and endeavor to produce outstanding multimedia creations within the traditions of the humanities.
the performing arts go beyond text and are fundamentally experiential, engaging sight, sound, and physicality.
it wasn't until the 1980s, with the rise of affordable personal computers capable of processing images, sounds, and videos, that computers started to enable a meaningful representation of live performances.
larry friedlander's groundbreaking shakespeare project, initiated in 1984 on an ibm infowindow system and later switching to hypercard in 1987 during its apple development stage, anticipated the use of digital technology in performance education.
due to the rudimentary graphics and lack of video capabilities in personal computers at the time, friedlander devised a solution using a dual-screen setup that accessed media from a laserdisc.
this laserdisc stored various images and six pivotal video segments, such as contrasting scenes from hamlet, macbeth, and king lear.
friedlander ingeniously used this video content in three distinct ways within the framework of the shakespeare project.
in the performance section, students had the opportunity to engage with shakespearean text while watching videos, switch between different film versions seamlessly, navigate to specific parts of the text, and switch between the original audio of the film and a recording where friedlander offers insights into the actors' "subtext." the study section provided interactive tutorials for students to explore various aspects of shakespearean performance like character portrayal and verse.
additionally, in the notebook section, students could extract digital video clips to include in their essays.
through each of these sections, the computer enabled students to closely and flexibly analyze performances almost as thoroughly as they would with a printed text.
in the 1990s, these cd-roms utilized the video display capabilities of personal computers, eliminating the necessity for a laserdisk player and an additional monitor.
although this method was more sophisticated, space-saving, and economical compared to laserdisk systems, the video quality of early cd-rom titles was inferior and smaller in size.
however, by 2000, advancements in computer processors, video cards, efficient video compression technologies, and the widespread adoption of dvd technology bridged the gap between personal computers and laserdisk players.
even the most elaborate theater models and scenery, regardless of how detailed, immersive, or interactive they are, only replicate the performance environment.
efforts have also been made to utilize computer animation methods to replicate the essence of theatrical performances for educational and academic purposes.
one early pioneer in this field was larry friedlander, who developed theatergame in collaboration with the shakespeare project.
this groundbreaking software garnered significant media attention for its time.
theatergame enabled students to explore staging techniques by selecting basic two-dimensional human figures, dressing them in various costumes, arranging set pieces on a virtual stage, and manipulating the actors to depict simple gestures.
the primary aim was to provide inexperienced students or those without access to live actors an opportunity to examine the impact of fundamental staging decisions.
during the same period when friedlander was developing theatergame, tom calvert set out to create a more advanced application aimed at choreographers.
starting in the 1970s, he initiated a project known as compose, which initially functioned as a dance notation system on a mainframe computer, producing output on a line printer.
by the 1980s, calvert enhanced compose by integrating 3-d human animations in lieu of abstract symbols for movements, resulting in a new program named lifeforms.
despite its featureless wireframe human models, lifeforms boasted impeccable, adaptable, and anatomically precise movements.
positioned as a dance composition tool, lifeforms operated akin to a word processor for dance enthusiasts and professionals.
this software gained global recognition when the esteemed choreographer merce cunningham embraced it in 1990.
subsequently, lifeforms transformed into a commercial product in the early 1990s.
virtual vaudeville aims to create an immersive experience where viewers are enveloped by the lively atmosphere of a theatrical production both on stage and behind the scenes.
upon entering the virtual theater, audiences can observe animated performances from various vantage points within the audience, with the ability to engage with other animated spectators.
skilled actors are reenacting live stage shows, with their movements and facial expressions captured through advanced technology and applied to 3-d models resembling performers from the nineteenth century.
the platform is under development using a cutting-edge gaming engine typically employed for designing high-performance commercial 3-d action games.
throughout a succession of shows beginning with invisible site: a virtual sho in 1991, coates honed a method for creating a striking deception of live actors seamlessly embedded in a dynamic 3-d virtual setting.
audience members are equipped with polarized glasses to witness expansive, high-definition stereoscopic displays of digital graphics.
these projections envelop the rotating stage, encompassing not only the rear wall but also the stage floor and translucent black scrims in front of the actors.
the digital visuals are dynamically altered during the shows to ensure precise coordination between the live actors and the media.
the integration of computers in the realm of performing arts goes beyond being just a new tool within a traditional field; it fundamentally questions core beliefs about performance.
initially, it blurs the lines separating various performance disciplines.
for instance, can we definitively categorize a performance where a performer triggers pre-recorded dialogues while moving on stage as music, dance, or theater?
secondly, it challenges the distinction between academic research and artistic expression.
for instance, is a person who reconstructs a full stage design, script, and performance based on historical fragments to create a virtual performance simulation to be considered an artist or a scholar?
is someone who invents new artificial intelligence algorithms to enable a dramatic interplay between a digital character and a live actor functioning as a computer scientist or an artist who employs computers as a creative tool?
ultimately, digital technology blurs the line between live performance and media.
for instance, when a live performer engages with a computer-generated animation, is the animation considered "live"?
this trend is in line with findings from other studies demonstrating the displacement of early grassroots attempts to harness the internet and the web for political activism as established power structures also adapt to leverage these technologies, eventually reclaiming their dominance online.
similarly, advocates of online religion envision a global internet facilitating a diverse, dialogical culture promoting multiple voices from various religious backgrounds in a new pluralistic environment.
however, current internet usage patterns, while slightly favoring previously marginalized beliefs, predominantly mirror and uphold the existing religious landscape characterized by loyalty to one's own faith and efforts to promote it.
in the beginning of an email, there isn't a direct match between von neumann's logical elements and the hardware parts found in contemporary computers.
therefore, i will allocate a segment to each logical part, offering a fundamental overview of its function, and delve deeper into how specific hardware components execute the tasks associated with that logical element.
the selection of components and the order of discussion will be influenced by the contextual framework - the process of typing and sending an email containing the message "hi!".
throughout, i may include supplementary remarks rather than exclude a crucial element.
keyboards operate with simple microprocessors that continually scan the circuit board for closed circuits representing key presses and releases.
upon detecting a completed circuit, the microprocessor cross-references it with a programmed character map, akin to a seating chart of characters.
in cases where multiple circuits are closed simultaneously, the microprocessor verifies if the key combination is defined in the character map.
the character map then leads to a designated scan code for the completed circuit, which is transmitted to the computer for conversion into the appropriate ascii bit string.
while the scan codes are standardized, the character map is specific to each keyboard model.
the key role of the character map is to distinguish the keyboard's functionality from the actual characters visible on the keys.
returning to the realm of inactive keys, we find scan codes patiently residing in the bios, a crucial component tasked with facilitating seamless coordination among different computer parts.
despite being a form of software code, the bios is housed within the chipset.
generally, computer systems operate with three tiers of software: the operating system (os), specific device drivers equipped with instructions for operating individual peripherals, and the bios responsible for deciphering and relaying instructions and data between the os and drivers.
notably, the bios facilitates the transmission of electrical signals exchanged among various peripherals.
in essence, the bios intercepts the scan code, converts it into the corresponding ascii code, and forwards it to the os for processing.
subsequently, the video adapter undergoes a check, and if everything is in order, content will display on the monitor.
the system ram is then tested, with the machine appearing to meticulously count each byte of memory.
following this, the post process progresses through various system components, verifying their functionality and, when necessary, loading a device driver into the bios to ensure swift and proper operation upon the os's request.
typically, the bios subsequently provides a brief summary of the system configuration on the screen, briefly flashing before the os commences.
afterward, the post revisits the cmos to identify designated boot devices, hardware components that could harbor an os.
finally, the bios inspects the boot sector of these devices for a master boot record, seizing command of the pc for the startup's remainder.
a ram chip consists of numerous pairs of transistors and capacitors interconnected to form memory cells, each capable of storing a single data bit.
the capacitors retain a charge while the transistors function as switches, enabling the control circuitry to alter the capacitor's state.
these components are organized in a grid layout, with columns linked by bitlines and rows by wordlines.
these "lines" refer to minuscule electrically conductive strands etched on the ram chip.
when an electrical impulse passes through a bitline, active transistors charge their capacitors.
the unique combination of bitlines and wordlines assigns an address to each transistor and capacitor, hence the term "random access" as any memory cell can be directly accessed with its specific address.
most ram is deemed volatile or dynamic due to the constant leakage of charge from the capacitors, necessitating frequent refreshing.
after the introduction of bells, municipal authorities innovated various timekeeping mechanisms to regulate various aspects of daily life such as commerce and communication.
commencing in the 13th century, marketplace activities were overseen by clocks, dictating trading hours for different vendors and shopping schedules for the local residents.
before the 15th century, universities structured their lectures flexibly based on subject matter.
however, by the 15th century, especially in secondary education, the day was divided into specific time blocks for teaching various subjects, marked by the use of bells and hourglasses.
apart from organizing the daily schedule, these timekeeping tools played a role in standardizing spatial rationalization.
from the 15th to the 18th centuries, postal and courier services transitioned from measuring distance to quantifying it in terms of time intervals.
despite the qwerty arrangement not being the most efficient layout of keys regardless of the printing mechanism used, it proved to be the most practical among sholes's designs.
sholes encountered a design challenge involving overlapping rods, which led to potential jamming if consecutive keys were pressed by a typist.
this would require the operator to pause and fix the issue, causing a waste of time.
to minimize jamming, sholes strategically placed keys for letters that often appear side by side in commonly used words.
the purpose of this arrangement was to enhance speed by ensuring better coordination between the operator and the machine.
while it is commonly believed that sholes intended to slow down typists, his actual goal was to foster improved synchronization between man and machine, creating a manageable rhythm and sequence beneficial to both.
it wasn't until about fifteen years after the invention of the typewriter that the idea of using all fingers for typing was commonly accepted.
initially, there was skepticism about teaching this technique, with many typists successfully using the "hunt and peck" method.
longley introduced a pamphlet advocating for a ten-finger typing method.
despite facing significant opposition in the trade press, she persisted in promoting her concept.
five years later, frank mcgurrin, a court stenographer from st.
louis, also proposed a similar ten-finger typing approach, including the innovation of "touch typing." mcgurrin faced resistance as well, but he demonstrated the effectiveness of his method by winning a typing competition in 1888.
the chord keyset was envisioned by engelbart to enable users to operate a keyset and a mouse simultaneously without needing to look at their hands.
he envisaged a modernized version of the remington typist who could change paper seamlessly without interrupting her work.
according to his vision, the input devices would serve as natural extensions of the human hands, allowing users to manipulate them without relying on other senses.
however, mastering this seamless interaction would necessitate acquiring a new language, a fresh code, and an additional symbol set that closely mirrored the binary system utilized by computers.
the line dividing humans and machines appeared blurred, with humans seeming to embrace the characteristics of machines rather than vice versa.
engelbart's pursuit of developing input devices to enhance human intellect, despite encountering apparent contradictions, serves as a significant source of inspiration alongside licklider for envisioning the future potential of computers.
in his 1961 report titled "program on human effectiveness", engelbart outlines his vision for empowering individuals to become more effective problem solvers.
his ultimate goal is to optimize human problem-solving capabilities by integrating computers into various facets of our problem-solving processes.
he emphasizes the importance of training humans not only in utilizing these input devices but also understanding the underlying logical operations of computers.
although engelbart aspires for humans to teach computers, he currently focuses on creating tools and machines that can aid in training humans.
in contemporary times, the early exposure of children to computers has normalized tasks like using a mouse and programming languages to the point where they appear intuitive and natural.
to illustrate, a historian conducting an analysis on demographic information extracted from census books, parish records, and city directories may categorize individuals based on their gender, age, occupation, and birthplace.
birthplaces, in turn, could be categorized into large or small cities, towns, villages, or rural parishes.
meanwhile, a linguist examining a text might categorize every word by its part of speech or each sentence by its structure.
additionally, linguists, literary experts, and social scientists may sort words found in a text by semantic categories and organize them into semantic networks.
the act of classification serves a dual purpose, each profoundly significant: it groups similar objects together under a class while also segregating dissimilar objects into distinct classes, thus highlighting the differences that are relevant to the classification's objective.
moreover, the classification system itself, through pinpointing properties crucial for determining similarities and differences, can illuminate a specific perspective regarding the essence of the objects under classification.
classification hinges on identifying the characteristics of the object under classification, thus achieving perfect classification necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the object.
a flawless classification system would reflect impeccable knowledge of the object.
for example, in subject classification, positioning each topic within a field in a multi-dimensional space close to related topics and distant from unrelated ones results in a precise depiction of the intellectual landscape relevant to the area being categorized.
consequently, classification systems not only serve practical purposes but also carry considerable theoretical significance.
such systems inherently presuppose some theoretical framework regarding the objects being classified, even if it is merely positing certain attributes of the objects.
essentially, any ontology can be viewed as laying the groundwork for classifying the entities it defines.
similarly, any classification system can, with varying degrees of ease, be seen as a manifestation of a specific ontology.
most classification systems designed for broad application often settle for depicting an imperfect picture of the intellectual framework within their subject area.
they strive, with differing degrees of achievement, to confine their theoretical suppositions to ones that the majority of anticipated users would likely accept.
in extreme cases, these underlying assumptions in a classification system can become virtually imperceptible, making them unchallengeable or open to reassessment.
for scholarly endeavors, such opacity poses risks and should be averted.
every scenario mentioned up to this point categorizes objects according to a singular attribute assigned to the object.
ideally, this attribute can be easily and consistently assessed, and its possible values are distinct.
as the instances become more ambiguous, the classification procedure is expected to be more challenging to implement, potentially resulting in a loss of information when using the classified data instead of the raw data for analyses.
in more complex classification systems, multiple characteristics are taken into account, often creating a hierarchy of increasingly detailed distinctions.
for instance, the dewey decimal classification system designates class numbers in the 800s for literary works.
within this range, the 820s are reserved for english literature, the 830s for german literature, the 840s for french literature, and so forth.
under the 820s, the number 821 represents english poetry, 822 english drama, 823 english fiction, and so forth.
additional digits beyond the third digit provide even more specific categorizations.
consequently, the classification system presents both the classifier and the user with a structured hierarchy of classes and subclasses, resembling a tree-like structure where smaller classes branch out from larger ones.
in many instances, the concept of classification depicting an n-dimensional cartesian space can be a significant oversimplification.
despite this, it remains practical to portray each attribute or feature used in a classification as defining a point along an axis, regardless of whether that axis is relevant for all categories within the system.
for those who find this metaphorical approximation bothersome, they may find it entertaining to envision the logical space established by such a classification not as cartesian or newtonian, but as a relativistic space with non-euclidean geometry.
a pre-coordinate system involves pre-specifying combinations of terms from different axes for classification or indexing objects.
on the other hand, a post-coordinate system involves identifying values along various axes, allowing for flexible combinations during searches.
printed indices in a fixed order of descriptors represent a pre-coordinate scheme, while online indices enable searches with arbitrary axis combinations, defining a post-coordinate system.
although printed indices can allow free term combinations, post-coordinate indexing is more user-friendly for computer systems.
an a priori system is characterized by predefined axes and values, where items are categorized accordingly.
on the other hand, in an a posteriori or data-driven system, the axes and values are formulated based on encountered items post-analysis.
data-driven classification methods, such as author-specified keywords and free-text searching, serve as straightforward examples.
citation analysis, especially examining co-citation patterns in academic literature as outlined by garfield, is another illustration of a data-driven approach.
in certain cases, determining axes in a data-driven system may require complex and costly statistical analysis of data.
latent semantic analysis exemplifies this process: it starts by considering the presence or absence of every word in the vocabulary across all indexed documents as an axis.
through statistical analysis, efforts are made to consolidate as many axes as feasible and pinpoint a valuable set of axes that are as close to perpendicular as the data permits.
in a standard scenario, latent-semantic analysis will categorize documents within a space of approximately 200 dimensions.
while it is occasionally feasible to explore the dimensions and attribute individual meanings to them, data-driven statistical techniques typically do not aim to interpret each axis of their space separately.
let's assign numbers from 1 to n to label the classes, where n represents the total number of classes.
assuming that the objects to be classified can be arranged in a specific order, the method used for this ordering is not of current relevance.
subsequently, let's organize the descriptions of potential classifications into a particular sequence.
although the descriptions may be practically limitless, we can still arrange them systematically.
assuming the descriptions are presented in english or any other natural language, we can consider categorizing them first based on their length and then alphabetically.
while distinguishing whether a given english text qualifies as a description of a classification may pose challenges, for the purposes of this exercise, we can meticulously outline all english texts and any sequences of letters, spaces, and punctuation.
in situations requiring systematic classification, researchers have the option of utilizing an existing classification scheme or creating a new one based on their specific needs.
established schemes are typically well-documented and widely recognized, potentially offering a more in-depth exploration of technical aspects compared to a hastily devised scheme.
these established schemes draw from extensive data sets, likely offering a more comprehensive coverage—including unique cases—than a researcher could achieve independently.
additionally, they are more conducive to facilitating direct comparisons with materials organized by others.
these relationships offer more than just improved information storage and retrieval capabilities; they also promote heightened critical and methodological self-awareness.
a database not only facilitates quick access to specific facts but also allows unexpected connections to emerge serendipitously.
therefore, in the context of humanistic studies, relational databases serve as para-interpretative structures rather than purely pre-interpretative tools.
similarly, in digital humanities, the process of creation often holds as much significance for the experiential value of scholarly work as the ultimate utilization of the end product.
regrettably, there are additional instances of redundancy persisting in the database.
notably, each publisher entry in our database lists new york as its location, resulting in repetitive data across all six publisher records.
this duplication could have been prevented by adhering strictly to a precise definition of "types of information that vary independently of one another" during the creation of our initial er diagram.
in reality, identifying such redundancies can be challenging during the initial domain analysis.
in some cases, these duplications may only become apparent after substantial data has been input into a prototype system.
in this instance, we must include a foreign key value that corresponds to a primary key in the authors table.
there are three approaches to achieve this.
the first method involves identifying the relevant record in the authors table, noting its primary key, and incorporating it into the insert statement for the work entry.
the second method suggests performing an update statement post the record creation to append the author's primary key to the foreign key field author_id in the work record.
the third and potentially most efficient method is to integrate the primary key lookup statement within the insert statement for adding a work record.
all these methods necessitate proficiency in querying the database; hence, we will briefly defer this discussion to delve into sql query commands.
the limitations of a derivative model like tei in accurately representing the structures and functions of traditional textual documents become evident upon observation.
traditional documents, embedded with their own markup codes, provide simulations not just of language but also of various semeiotic processes as described by peirce.
these texturized documents serve to narrow and alter the broader semeiotic context in which they exist, often for self-reflective intentions.
however, the operational confines imposed by traditional textual forms on the encompassing semeiotic context they imitate and replicate are notably more practical, in a comprehensive peircean sense, than the current electronic models being utilized.
alongside the progression of the ivanhoe project, a related initiative known as time modelling was undertaken by bethany nowviskie and johanna drucker.
the purpose of this project was to incorporate visualization and interface design at the outset of projects like ivanhoe, which focus on interpretation through transformative and sometimes disruptive interactions with primary data.
while ivanhoe's computer is configured to record and algorithmically analyze players' interpretative actions for post-game evaluation, the primary critical function occurs retrospectively as humans reflect on the varied patterns revealed by the computerized analyses.
in contrast, the time modelling device seamlessly intertwines performative and critical actions, with users actively participating in deliberate digital transformations.
this device provides users with a range of design tools to restructure a chronological timeline of events subjectively and speculatively.
originally, our idea revolved around creating "ultimate ivanhoe," a playspace guided by emergent consciousness software.
in this setup, the computer would play an active role during ivanhoe sessions, allowing players to assess and compare their interpretations of their actions with computer-generated perspectives.
while the potential for realizing this vision of ivanhoe still exists, the concept of time modelling highlighted an alternative approach to positioning the human observer within an autopoietic system.
a different perspective on these concepts can be achieved by reimagining textspace as topological, providing unique benefits.
while this space operates as an autopoietic system, it doesn't conform to conventional dimensional standards in mathematics.
instead, the model we suggest autonomously defines and evaluates its dimensions as part of its self-organizing mechanisms.
moreover, a space characterized by interdependent relationships implies that any specified dimension within the system can be systematically linked to others.
this transformative capability is what shifts the notion of a dimension to that of a dementian.
this text-processing model is characterized by its open-ended, discontinuous, and non-hierarchical nature.
it unfolds within a fieldspace that becomes apparent through the act of "reading." a digital processing software needs to be conceptualized and developed to enable the marking and storing of these textual field maps.
subsequently, the program would facilitate the examination of their growth, evolution, and comparison with other textual mappings and interactions.
by framing textualities as spaces within these contexts, it bypasses various critical biases that limit our conventional understanding of texts.
it circumvents binary interpretations such as text versus reader or subjective versus objective textual perspectives.
reader-response criticism attempted to address these issues but inadvertently reinforced the existing distinctions.
this perspective highlights that these distinctions are essentially tools for understanding.
from this standpoint, the "text" we engage with is considered an autopoietic occurrence that we actively engage with and contribute to.
a natural enhancement to the aforementioned method was to substitute extensive strings of intricate formatting codes with more straightforward abbreviations that could be automatically enlarged into the formatting commands they represented.
instead of inputting the entire command sequence, the typesetter would simply enter the abbreviation.
during the 1960s and 1970s, these abbreviated commands were commonly referred to as "macros." this term was borrowed from assembly language programming, where it denoted symbolic instructions at a higher level, which would be expanded into lower-level primitive instructions before program execution.
enhancing portability and interoperability is key.
documents that employ clear descriptive markup instead of complex, application-specific formatting directives make it significantly simpler to transfer them to different text processing systems.
oftentimes, minimal adjustments like changing delimiter conventions, replacing specific labels with others, and converting formatting guidelines to align with the new platform are all that's required.
as mentioned earlier, the purpose of this chapter is not to teach the reader about text encoding but to offer a brief historical and theoretical context to enhance comprehension.
here, we discuss key themes in sgml and xml and address various topics we consider beneficial.
however, for a comprehensive understanding, we recommend referring to the "gentle introduction" and the additional readings listed in the references below.
despite the complexity that may make the sgml standard challenging to comprehend, its fundamental concept is straightforward.
sgml serves as a metalanguage, a language for creating machine-readable definitions of descriptive markup languages.
by defining the parameters such as markup tag delimiters, permitted arrangements of identified components, asserted characteristics, and abbreviations, sgml facilitates the creation of structured documents.
another perspective describes sgml as a metagrammar—a grammar for outlining other grammars, using the term "grammar" in the specialized sense within linguistics and computer science.
one of the significant issues was the lack of diversity in the html element set.
to fulfill its potential, web publishing needed to support advanced and specialized markup languages.
this required enhancing the software for handling dtds to allow for the use of various markup vocabularies without prior coordination.
moreover, there was a clear need to establish a method for more dependable processing of document instances even in the absence of dtds.
the text encoding initiative (tei) was born in november 1987 during a gathering at vassar college, organized by the association for computers in the humanities and sponsored by the national endowment for the humanities.
thirty-two experts from various fields, including professional organizations, libraries, archives, and projects across europe, north america, and asia, participated in this meeting.
the participants shared a common concern about the growing problem of numerous incompatible and inadequately structured encoding systems, which posed a serious hindrance to the utilization of computers for advancing research in the humanities.
the association for computers in the humanities, the association for literary and linguistic computing, and the association for computational linguistics collaborated to establish a steering linguist committee and create an advisory board comprising delegates from different professional societies.
michael sperberg-mcqueen from the university of illinois at chicago and lou burnard from oxford university were appointed as editors.
additionally, four working committees were established.
by the conclusion of 1989, more than fifty scholars were actively engaged in the initiative, with its scope expanding rapidly.
the history behind the creation of the tei guidelines highlighted in this brief account underscores a crucial aspect.
the guidelines emerged and persist as a result of a vast collaborative effort among scholars worldwide spanning various disciplines and countries, each bringing diverse perspectives and interests.
this comprehensive endeavor included active involvement from professionals in different fields and institutions and unfolded over numerous years through a structured process of development, assessment, and synchronization, featuring thorough testing across diverse projects.
the culmination of these efforts is manifested in a text encoding system distinguished by its exceptional robustness and intricacy.
arguments about the prevalence of electronic text, like the one presented in 1971, may appear overstated considering it was a time precluding personal computers, character standards, and the internet as we know it today.
yet, remarkably, these early writings on electronic texts in the humanities before 1995 astoundingly foresaw the utility of electronic text even when the concept was unfamiliar to many.
it's crucial to acknowledge the emergence of the world wide web in the 1990s when assessing the insights of computational humanists.
before this digital milestone, despite significant discussion about the applications and readership of electronic text, few anticipated its potential as a potent tool for widespread dissemination or its subsequent popularity as a means of sharing textual content with a broad audience.
however, in 1971, the environment described by wisbey, characterized by computing centers that accommodated humanists' needs, was present at only a few universities and research centers.
these centers were more likely to attract scientists and social scientists than literary scholars or historians.
typically, universities only had a small number of humanities professors with an interest in electronic texts, leading to a sense of isolation for computing humanists.
therefore, annual conferences and specialized journals became crucial platforms for like-minded colleagues to engage in discussions about various issues, ideas, and advancements.
most of these studies were written before the widespread popularity of the world wide web.
although the web does not completely resolve all issues related to creating, storing, delivering, and displaying electronic texts, it does simplify many of these tasks, particularly when compared to older technologies like ftp, listserv, and gopher.
initially, early adopters, enthusiasts, and critics considered electronic texts primarily for scholars and researchers to aid in traditional humanistic work, as described in the aforementioned table of contents.
they did not anticipate the world wide web's potential to reach a broader audience of readers.
some individuals, particularly those affiliated with project gutenberg, are wary of encoding methods, arguing that avoiding encoding could enhance the longevity of e-texts amidst evolving hardware, operating systems, and applications.
project gutenberg embraces simplicity by not necessitating special software or extensive training for contributors, fostering a culture of volunteerism.
despite potentially surpassing 10,000 titles by the close of 2003, the accuracy of transcriptions may be questionable due to the absence of centralized editorial oversight.
the absence of encoding presents challenges such as the inability to distinguish notes from the main text, identify chapter boundaries swiftly, or denote text formatting like highlighting and font changes.
nevertheless, the founder of project gutenberg, michael hart, has successfully harnessed a volunteer-driven ethos akin to many open-source initiatives.
numerous individuals have explored the concept of establishing a repository housing manuscripts and alternative editions tailored for both scholarly researchers and casual readers.
within this publication model, scholars would be able to examine all manuscript variations to track the evolution of a piece through its different versions, while the general public could engage with a curated reading experience provided by the editors and sourced directly from the original materials.
this proposed archival approach for renowned authors like yeats and hardy has the potential to benefit a wide audience, yet implementation has proven to be highly challenging.
apart from a few prominent initiatives like the canterbury tales project, this vision has seldom materialized, underscoring the immense dedication and labor involved.
various individuals including scholars, students, librarians, computing professionals, and enthusiasts across diverse fields engage in the creation and dissemination of electronic texts.
notably, commercial publishers, originally recognized for their microfilm collections, are now transitioning to digitize and offer access to significantly extensive collections comprising tens of thousands of volumes.
collaborative efforts between institutions and publishers, exemplified by initiatives like the university of virginia's joint venture with chadwyck-healey for early american fiction, and the text creation partnerships established for early english books online and the evans early american imprints, highlight the partnerships forged in the realm of electronic text publication.
how do scholars and students in the humanities go about creating electronic texts?
one approach involves a continuum ranging from a traditional method where considerable time and attention are devoted to producing carefully considered, well-documented, and meticulously edited electronic works.
examples of this approach include the women writers online project at brown university, the archive of henrik ibsen's writings supported by the national library of norway and managed by the universities of oslo and bergen, and the collection of sir isaac newton's manuscripts at imperial college, london.
on the other end of the spectrum are less structured efforts that rely on volunteers and enthusiasts, with well-known instances like project gutenberg and distributed proofreaders.
this diversity in approaches reflects the range of editorial practices seen in the last century, akin to the distinctions between scholarly editions and reading editions, which cater to different objectives and readerships.
while some scholars find the latter category adequate for classroom instruction or quick reference, others prioritize the thorough documentation and editorial standards typical of the former.
there is a growing interest in enhancing this situation as libraries are now incorporating electronic text records into their online catalogs.
innovations like the open archives initiative have the potential to streamline the discovery process of electronic texts.
efforts are being made to create search methods that can access diverse collections across various institutions.
this advancement would enable individuals, such as those intrigued by nineteenth-century american history, to conduct a single comprehensive search across multiple sites holding collections from that era, with the results conveniently gathered and displayed in a unified interface.
there is an additional type of division that is emerging.
there is a growing gap between individuals who have access to an expanding array of collections offered by commercial publishers and those who do not.
this gap was evident at a recent conference focusing on nineteenth-century american literature, where it was observed that graduate students at prestigious research universities had access to diverse commercially published digital text collections, while many of their counterparts who had recently started jobs at smaller institutions did not.
despite the fact that these early-career academics may no longer need to physically visit institutions to view original documents, they still rely on resources to travel to institutions with licensed electronic text collections.
however, there is optimism for these scholars as more libraries and museums are digitizing larger segments of their collections and making them accessible to the public.
one major issue is the restricted variety of electronic texts accessible.
researchers or readers using electronic texts face a chaotic assortment, with little consideration given to choosing suitable editions, as noted by mcgann.
it parallels a race for territory as publishers, libraries, and individuals endeavor to release substantial collections.
the quantity of freely obtainable texts, including initiatives like making of america, the wright american fiction project, the university of virginia e-text center, and the library of congress's american memory, is expanding rapidly.
the aforementioned commercial publishers initially commenced their journey as microfilm publishers, where their collections were built based on the same concept.
copyright law significantly influences most electronic text collections.
with very few electronic text collections containing copyrighted material, even those offered by commercial publishers, two primary effects are observed.
firstly, digital collections primarily feature works by authors who lived and published before the twentieth century, as works by newer authors are likely still under copyright protection and harder to reproduce.
secondly, new editions of pre-twentieth-century writers are usually favored, as projects and publishers opt for works in the public domain.
consequently, contemporary literary criticism, biographies, and theories, which could offer essential context and analysis of primary literature, are mostly absent.
the full potential of the medium to provide a comprehensive context for studying primary literary texts and historical documents has not been fully realized to date.
in a way, the world wide web has revolutionized the creation and dissemination of electronic texts on a scale previously unimaginable.
however, the tools currently used for accessing these texts often fall short in comparison to the functionalities provided by traditional publishing methods like cd-roms.
this shortfall may stem from the lack of consensus on how electronic texts should be utilized, as well as the challenges of developing comprehensive text analysis tools that cater to a wide array of text collections.
the adoption of more advanced automated analysis will likely remain constrained until more sophisticated tools become more universally accessible.
in the interim, common activities will mainly revolve around basic keyword searches and text retrieval techniques.
while these practices hold significance for many academics, they only scratch the surface of the potential offered by humanities computing.
on the field, your plans were like a sacred scripture to you, always by your side, becoming dog-eared, yellowed, and stained with mud, bearing witness to your dedication.
despite their revered status, the plans only marked the beginning.
once you set foot on the site, everything changed.
no amount of meticulous preparation could anticipate the variables.
it was a fascinating moment when you encountered the real site, a departure from the idealized sketches.
for instance, let's consider the familiarity one may have with a specific theme in a well-known piece of literature.
when creating a model, one starts by giving importance to this knowledge, regardless of its accuracy, and then constructs a digital representation of it using tools like text analysis to specify a structured vocabulary of word forms.
initially, this model is likely to expose minor mistakes or oversights.
however, with continuous refinement, these minor errors are gradually replaced by insightful discoveries.
models can surprise us by either revealing unexpected success, such as finding a word where it shouldn't be, or by puzzling failures, like missing a word that should be present.
these surprises challenge the modeling process.
as a research instrument, modeling proves its worth when it leads to failures, either by exposing shortcomings within the model itself or by highlighting flawed concepts indirectly.
the term "diagram" functions both as a noun and a verb, with a wide range of verb forms.
just like the word "represent," its action is defined more by concepts than by visual representation, even when that representation is highly detailed.
in physics, as maxwell points out, diagrams frequently portray force or motion, even if implicitly, despite their static nature.
in the context of communication, such as during a lecture or a collaborative discussion, the act of diagramming takes precedence over the fixed result.
this end product might actually be incomprehensible without the dynamic discussion it originated from.
the reason why answering this question is essential is that our work involves an experimental approach that requires specific equipment and established methods.
to proficiently apply these methods, we must have a comprehensive understanding of our actions.
i have termed the essence of this approach as "modeling" and proposed that when grasped correctly, modeling can lead to a form of computing that is integrated with the humanities, enabling a continual process of gaining knowledge through manipulating representations.
despite being on solid epistemological ground, the challenge lies in articulating the intellectual justification for the techniques involved in this process.
consequently, the lack of a structured discourse on modeling results in its significance being overshadowed.
while the explicit methods and concrete actions are evident, the inability to effectively explain the intellectual rationale behind the outcomes has relegated computing to being viewed merely as a tool and not as a respected discipline, often marginalized within academic circles.
however, the practical utility of this approach is undisputed.
stanley fish has posed a comprehensive challenge to the field of stylistics by questioning its fundamental principles.
he argues that the conventional approach of identifying formal structures in a text and interpreting them in isolation from the reader's perception renders stylistics fruitless.
fish contends that meaning is not inherent within the text but is constructed during the act of reading.
therefore, he dismisses the notion that the formal elements scrutinized by stylisticians hold significance independently from the reader's engagement with them.
according to fish, analyzing these features outside the reader's context results in a futile exercise as they only refer back to themselves and do not contribute to a deeper understanding of the text's meaning or its comparison with other texts.
fish aims to go beyond merely criticizing certain stylistic excesses; his objective is to completely dismantle stylistics.
the sense of urgency in his analysis arises from his skepticism towards the notion that stylistics possesses a unique "scientific" legitimacy and what he perceives as its anti-humanist inclination, which neglects the human element in reading and interpretation.
nonetheless, there is room to suggest an alternative rationale for stylistics: revealing hidden language usage patterns that might go unnoticed due to their subtle nature or widespread occurrence on a vast scale; and putting forth and validating hypotheses about language use where empirical confirmation appears feasible and fitting.
for instance, an exploration of a playwright's utilization of "thou" and "you" forms exemplifies the former, while investigating differences in writing styles between genders showcases the latter.
in computational stylistics, working with tendencies instead of rigid rules is essential due to the variability in the semantic function of language, making the relationship between features and meanings constantly shifting.
every element and combination thereof can take on novel meanings in different contexts.
despite this fluidity, there are discernible patterns and consistencies that call for a comprehensive theory of semantics.
while a textual unit like the pronoun "i" may hold a specific individual meaning within a given context, it also carries significance as part of a broader collection.
for instance, the use of "i" not only signals a speaker's identity but also contributes to the overall distribution of this pronoun in the text, indicating varying levels of first-person discourse throughout.
this aligns with a conventional, hypothesis-driven design approach.
an alternative method involves exploratory data analysis, where researchers alter various parameters to uncover significant insights.
when conducted cautiously, this method can unveil discoveries that could have been overlooked in a rigidly structured study.
with the decrease in time and costs associated with collecting, manipulating, and visually presenting data, the appeal of exploratory analysis has grown.
the concept of assigning authorship hinges on a specific concept of the author.
since the 1970s, the conventional academic practice of determining authorship has been carried out with a degree of uncertainty, influenced by the theories of french post-structuralists including roland barthes, michel foucault, and jacques derrida.
these thinkers challenged the notion of the bourgeois individual subject, diminishing the author's role as the primary source of meaning in texts.
in the realm of literature, this idea of the individual author had peaked during the romantic era's notion of the heroic author.
following the rise of structuralism, there has been a growing focus on the significance of discourse, culture, and language itself in shaping texts.
during the 1980s, there was a significant surge in the speed and capacity of computers.
as more texts were being generated in digital formats, it became feasible to compile corpora that surpassed the sizes of the brown and lob corpora, reaching millions of words.
the abundance of such large-scale language resources enabled the extraction of valuable statistical insights regarding language usage patterns.
these statistics played a vital role in enhancing language processing tools like syntactic parsers, igniting a fresh wave of interest in corpus compilation within the computational linguistics community.
additionally, parallel corpora, featuring identical texts in multiple languages, began to emerge during this period.
among these, the most renowned is the canadian hansard corpus, which encompasses parliamentary debates in both english and french.
corpora serve as a repository of samples crucial for developing numerical language models, making the utilization of corpora closely linked to empirical methodologies.
with the surge in electronic text volume in the late 1980s, the door opened for extensive implementation of data-driven approaches in tackling fundamental issues in computational linguistics, like part-of-speech recognition, prepositional phrase matching, parallel text alignment, and word sense disambiguation.
the triumph in addressing some of these challenges using statistical techniques paved the way for their extension to other areas, leading to the integration of statistical methods as a fundamental aspect of computational linguistics research by the mid-1990s.
probabilistic parsing is a modern use of statistical techniques in processing language.
to determine the likelihood that a specific syntactic structure is accurate within its context, vast amounts of data that have been previously annotated and checked for syntax are necessary.
since syntactic structures can be highly ambiguous, traditional parsers commonly generated multiple potential structural interpretations for a sentence.
in contrast, a probabilistic parser relies on existing statistical data to select the most probable analysis.
challenges in collecting corpus-based statistics involve ensuring that the corpus is truly representative of the entire language.
this requires including samples from a wide range of texts that capture different syntactic and semantic aspects of the language.
it is crucial for the corpus to be large enough to prevent issues of data sparseness commonly encountered in statistical analysis.
for instance, in tasks like word sense disambiguation, the data needs to be comprehensive to cover all meanings of a word with multiple senses and do so with enough frequency to derive meaningful statistical insights.
while classics like the brown corpus have been extensively utilized in natural language processing, their one million-word size falls short for contemporary large-scale applications.
many word senses remain unrepresented, syntactic patterns are too rare to be significant, and the corpus lacks the size required for computing bi-gram and tri-gram probabilities essential for training language models like those used in speech recognition.
regrettably, the main freely accessible corpora used for research are comprised of texts that are easily obtainable and can be redistributed without copyright restrictions.
as a consequence, corpora utilized for statistical analysis in language processing tend to be predominantly representative of certain genres, particularly newspaper articles, which make up the majority of texts available through sources like the ldc.
these texts also heavily influence the training datasets for speech recognition technology.
additionally, other accessible corpora mainly consist of technical documents, transcripts of legislative proceedings, brief phone conversations, and similar content.
consequently, corpus-based natural language processing primarily relies on language data from a limited range of specialized fields, resulting in potential biases.
for instance, in newspaper data, there is an overabundance of complex noun phrase complements for certain verbs, commonly found in newspaper-style sentences like "the price increased by two percent to $102 per share from $100 per share." collecting genuine language data from corpora allows for a description of language that is grounded in evidence rather than being based on a specific theoretical framework.
since language users produce texts with actual communicative intentions, collections of texts from native speakers serve as authentic examples of language use.
this is why one of the primary applications of corpora is in compiling dictionaries, especially "learners' dictionaries" aimed at individuals acquiring a foreign language.
the compilation of the cobuild corpus commenced in the early 1980s, comprising approximately 7 million words at that time.
it served as the foundation for developing the collins cobuild english dictionary, marking the pioneering dictionary to solely depend on corpora for its development.
subsequently, within the following decade, the majority of british dictionary publishers adopted corpora as their main source for dictionary content.
interestingly, it is only recently that american dictionary publishers have started turning to corpora for lexicographical guidance.
typically, there has been a lack of collaboration between researchers in the humanities and those in computational linguistics, despite sharing common issues and objectives.
however, this pattern is expected to shift with the rise of the world wide web.
humanists now have greater access to information on computational linguistics research and the tools developed by that field.
conversely, computational linguists may encounter fresh challenges in language processing as they navigate a wider range of web-accessible content, such as literary texts and historical records.
ultimately, the anticipated cooperation between these two disciplines promises to significantly enhance the capabilities of both.
faith is indispensable when it comes to trusting any printed version, whether crafted by franklin or by another editor, myself included.
readers are often unable to fully examine the documentary evidence that influences decisions on anything from genre classification to the appropriateness of content in an academic publication.
these considerations are not only crucial to the humanities field but also form the core of knowledge creation in humanities.
the ability to scrutinize the creators and intents behind the academic materials we analyze, as well as to assess which components are fundamental and deserving of examination, is directly linked to the accessibility of essential documentary evidence facilitated by the medium of presentation.
compared to the limited visibility offered by printed book versions, electronic editions provide easier access to discussions on editorial accuracy, granting insight into the editorial procedures.
by including images of all edited documents along with their typographic translations, electronic editions enable a closer examination.
in this digital environment, it is not feasible to remove 74 words without explanation or to translate marks uniformly without attracting scrutiny.
readers can refer to digital document images to evaluate and compare with editors' interpretations.
the presentation of original documents as digital facsimiles alters the way scholars engage with foundational materials in scholarly editions, impacting notions of expertise and setting new standards.
the concept of a "poem" involves structuring and shaping perspectives and interpretations of dickinson's works to align with societal norms and literary conventions, regardless of the actual content.
following this guideline, the physical evidence, such as manuscripts, embodies the essence of a "poem", and it is the editor's duty to present this essence in a format that enables easy extraction of the poetic elements.
in this context, there are distinct textual boundaries defined by established genre conventions.
the challenge in deciphering textual annotations lies in resisting the urge to confine the text within prescribed categories of prose or poetry, as it often transcends such classifications, blending elements of both and necessitating creative adaptations of existing tei markup structures.
the lack of clear textual boundaries is evident in our submission form for co-editors, where we use quotation marks around the term "genre" to emphasize its imposition by the encoding system.
this highlights that while the categorization of texts into "poem" or "letter" is necessitated for bibliographical purposes, electronic editing allows for a more adaptable interpretation of emily dickinson's works and her genre manipulations.
this flexibility prompts readers to question the nature of the texts and the intentions behind them, leading to inquiries such as "what is this?" and "what is this writer aiming to express?" just as editors must consider the intentions of the authors, and readers should also take into account the intentions of both the writer and any subsequent editors, multiple editors collaborating on different sections of the same text must also consider the intentions of their fellow editors and collaborators.
readers who invest time and effort in adhering to the principles established for the scholarly production of texts are important participants in this process.
engaging with the various intentions that shape textual productions offers valuable insights for creating editorial environments that are not only reliable but also contribute to advancing critical comprehension.
this approach encourages scholars to explore new and previously unimagined questions.
as previously mentioned in another essay, lucy suchman offers perceptive insights into the conditions necessary for maximizing knowledge production.
when examining the concept of "objective knowledge" presented in a critical edition, it is suggested to move away from perceiving it as a singular, fixed standpoint that claims objectivity by silencing debate.
instead, in the context of creating a dynamic critical edition online, "objective knowledge" can be understood as a collection of diverse, situated viewpoints that achieve objectivity through continuous discussions.
as critical insight is multi-dimensional, it is crucial to engage in the processes of comparing and assessing these various perspectives akin to appreciating different viewpoints of an image.
the source of objectivity is not a static body of knowledge dictated by one entity but rather a continuously evolving pool of knowledge that we all contribute to and are accountable for.
a fitting comparison could be drawn to handwoven rugs that vary between those predominantly featuring russet tones and those where greens and blues take precedence.
in this context, the focus lies not on any individual stitch, thread, or color, but on the combined impact.
these effects are most noticeable when contrasting pieces are viewed together.
this will be the scenario i aim to illustrate.
the data being analyzed consists of word-counts for 150 common words in each of the forty specimens.
these words are among the most frequently used in seventeenth-century verse.
this comprehensive list provides more reliable results compared to a list generated from a smaller, more selective text sample being examined.
the texts were processed using the same protocols as the primary database, ensuring consistency.
modifications were made to modernize the texts by standardizing spelling variations prevalent in seventeenth-century texts.
contractions like "don't" and "i've" were expanded to count their full forms, while certain words like "so" and "that" were tagged to indicate their primary grammatical functions.
after these preparations, the texts were analyzed using sorting and counting programs.
raw word counts were adjusted to percentages relative to the total word count in each text to account for variations in text lengths and to ensure a fair comparison across texts.
this normalization helps prevent bias towards longer texts during analysis.
analyzing a large group of texts reveals intricate patterns of similarity and dissimilarity through concurrent variations.
these patterns are further complicated yet understandable due to the presence of numerous exceptions, some attributed to unique author characteristics.
the potential combinations across various genres, time periods, authors, and texts are virtually limitless.
these effects likely influence the perceptions of adept readers but can be challenging to express verbally.
on the contrary, statistical analysis provides a straightforward albeit less nuanced means of illustrating these patterns.
the collection features a total of sixteen plays, with the first ten being verse dramas followed by four prose dramas.
the last two plays, from southerne's the fatal marriage, offer a mix of both verse and prose.
each subset, including works by dryden, rochester, stapylton, congreve, and southerne, presents authorial pairs.
sedley and shadwell provide an opportunity to compare authorship styles between verse and prose.
although the sample size is limited, consisting of only 16 plays, they can be analyzed alongside the poetry and personal letters of the same period for informative insights.
an argument can be put forward to justify the exclusion of personal pronouns due to their inconsistent frequency, making them unreliable as measures.
if they are removed, then the issue of inflected verbs becomes significant.
it would seem reasonable to also eliminate them.
however, the growing loss of information at this point should be a cause for concern.
these three removals would result in 81 words being taken out of the original 150 on the list.
while achieving a desirable level of strictness, this action would come at a significant expense.
category d writing is characterized by the absence of first and second-person pronouns, with third-person pronouns such as "it" and "they" being prevalent.
articles mainly serve as referential markers, with a notable lack of feminine pronouns.
notably, historical texts, although sometimes more personalized than scholarly works, often do not prominently feature feminine pronouns.
an interesting case study could be examining whether feminine pronouns are used extensively in sections of gibbon's historical work, particularly in the chapter that discusses empress theodora's achievements.
the empress is one of the rare women mentioned in the titles of his 71 chapters.
contemporary feminist scholars are actively working to rebalance historical biases by revising the use of pronouns in scholarly discourse.
drawing inspiration from novels by henry fielding, dear reader, i am reminded that various literary forms, including the novel, can draw from multiple categories i have discussed.
naturally, when this happens, the usage of pronouns, articles, and auxiliary verbs is likely to undergo some modifications.
the limited list of identifiable literary forms i have presented only scratches the surface of the more obvious classifications.
i acknowledge that the term genre has expanded its scope in recent times and lost some of its former precision.
its broadened application becomes apparent when it is used to describe personal letters, which belong to a diverse group of loosely connected literary forms.
if a significant disparity in writing styles between male and female writers can diminish entirely within a generation or two, as indicated by these findings, the cause might not stem from biological distinctions between the genders.
however, if the discrepancies in "gender," as evidenced in the subtle nuances of male and female societal roles mentioned previously, were the primary rationale, it seems improbable that the shift would be almost complete.
regardless of individual perspectives, it is challenging to argue that the social distinctions in roles between men and women in english-speaking communities are no longer discernible.
the traditional form of textual analysis involves tasks such as separating, distinguishing, and focusing on individual works.
this method of literary analysis typically relies on what may appear to be intuitive observations and distinctions, which may seem different from the data collection and classification processes of computational stylistics that i have been emphasizing.
however, these insights and distinctions are not purely intuitive as they are rooted in a wealth of knowledge accumulated over a lifetime of reading, stored in the subconscious, and utilized through comparison and classification processes, whether explicitly or implicitly, as samuel johnson pointed out.
both traditional and computational methods of textual analysis possess unique advantages.
while the intricate connections in the plots of king lear or the refined interpretations made by coleridge in the initial lines of hamlet may elude digital analysis, the subtle ironies in jane austen's works or the nuanced ambiguities identified by william empson remain beyond reach as well.
however, computers excel in handling extensive textual datasets, identifying distinct patterns, and compiling occurrences of recurring elements more efficiently than human capabilities alone.
libraries, archives, and museums are actively collaborating on thematic research collections to complement their ongoing collection development efforts.
historically, these institutions have been vital for humanities research, gathering a wide array of materials across various subjects to support scholarly exploration.
despite the existence of numerous specialized research collections, their physical distance from scholars and students has been a challenge.
to address this, many organizations are now converting selected collections into digital formats, enhancing their accessibility on the internet for researchers, students, and the public.
the materials are organized thematically or centered around a specific research topic.
an illustration of this can be found in various collections at iath, such as the complete writings and pictures of dante gabriel rossetti: a hypermedia research archive, the dickinson electronic archives, and the walt whitman archive, which are all focused on the works of specific authors.
alternatively, collections can revolve around a particular literary or artistic creation, like uncle tom's cabin and american culture.
for instance, the hamlet on the ramparts collection, managed by the mit shakespeare project, is a prime example of a collection honing in on a narrowly defined literary subject.
this project endeavors to compile texts, artwork, photographs, films, sound recordings, and analyses related to a specific part of hamlet - his initial encounter with the ghost.
themes of a collection may pertain to an event, place, phenomenon, or any other subject of scholarly interest.
noteworthy examples beyond literature studies include projects focusing on the salem witch trials, pompeii forum, and the waters of rome.
some thematic collections are integrated within larger digital repositories.
using a contextual mass model, collections are formed to connect various sources, merging different materials and subjects to facilitate in-depth and comprehensive analysis within a particular field of study.
while numerous resources featured in this chapter encompass extensive primary material cores, such complexity is not obligatory for achieving contextual mass.
for instance, the decameron web project, focusing on the literary, historical, and cultural backdrop of boccaccio's renowned work, includes a critical edition alongside translations and supplementary materials like annotations, commentaries, critical essays, maps, and bibliographies.
the website's design and content clearly reflect its educational purpose, yet also serve as a robust research platform.
several established thematic collections demonstrate the concept of contextual depth and complexity, along with explicit objectives.
the primary focus of the rossetti archive is to encompass all of rossetti's textual and visual creations, supported by a range of contextual materials including contemporaneous works, personal correspondence, biographical information, and modern secondary sources.
the blake archive similarly places a strong emphasis on contextual information as a cornerstone of its scholarly mission.
the project's website underscores the idea that artworks derive meaning from their context, necessitating the presentation of texts alongside illustrations, illuminated books with other similar works, and combining them with additional drawings and paintings.
all these components are then situated within the broader scope of pertinent historical background.
the advent of hypertext has revolutionized the organization of collections, with current endeavors focused on establishing extensive links between aggregated materials.
for instance, the walt whitman hypertext archive aims to connect sources to illustrate the intricate and numerous revisions whitman made to his poems.
each poem's associated materials may include initial notes in a notebook, trial lines, published versions from periodicals, publisher's page proofs, and various printed book editions.
similarly, the bolles collection on the history of london, housed within the vast perseus digital library, leverages hypertext to provide complete historical texts on london.
this approach incorporates hyperlinks linked to names of towns, buildings, and individuals, enabling the correlation of items such as photographs, maps of locations, drawings, and biographies of people.
themed collections that emphasize providing support for contextual mass and activities are approaching the creation of a laboratory-like environment suitable for scholars' daily work.
similar to scientific labs, the ideal spaces should include necessary materials for study and reference, as well as tools to conduct research effectively.
for scholars in the humanities, a well-equipped workspace would offer access to sources found in libraries and archives relevant to their research area, enabling activities such as reading, analysis, interpretation, and writing that typically occur in their offices.
the most effective environments will expand beyond mere thematic focus by offering support for contextual mass and activities tailored not only to existing scholarly practices but also to the inquiries scholars wish to explore and the tasks they aim to accomplish.
in the past, scholars had to sift through numerous catalogues and indexes and visit multiple libraries to access a significant amount of material related to a specific author or subject.
they would painstakingly copy and gather information during their visits, facing restrictions when dealing with delicate items that could not be physically handled or reproduced through photocopying or microfilming.
nowadays, scholars are leveraging the capabilities of virtual collocation to assemble comprehensive collections.
by aggregating content dispersed across various repositories, they can create extensive and intricate compilations of sources that are easily accessible at any time and location.
for instance, the rossetti archive directory showcases a wide array of materials, such as images, poems, prose, illustrated texts, manuscripts, books, biographical information, bibliographies, timelines, and historical contexts, demonstrating the diverse and abundant resources that can be organized through the merging of digital materials.
copyright concerns have limited the full potential of digital collocation.
due to the ease of digitizing and sharing sources without copyright restrictions, older materials in the public domain are more commonly featured in digital collections.
with the aim of creating systematic and purposeful collections, curators are now navigating copyright regulations for published works and integrating new digital sources.
projects such as the william blake archive serve as a notable example by successfully collaborating with institutions and private collectors to address copyright issues and include valuable materials in their collections.
as an illustration, the profile of william blake includes references to 20 collections, with two of them being part of the william blake archive initiative.
collaborative efforts among various institutions commonly result in subject collections that encompass wide academic or geographic subjects.
some instances include the urban studies collection at the center for research libraries, an association focused on collective collection initiatives, and the cooperative development of east asian collections at the university of north carolina and duke university.
special collections departments curate specialized collections based on specific subjects and themes, primarily focusing on primary source materials.
these departments safeguard and provide restricted access to rare and delicate items like manuscripts and papers.
with the advent of online accessibility by research libraries, special collections often became the priority for digitization.
this move aimed to broaden access to the valuable treasures held within these collections, offering digital alternatives to physical viewing that helps reduce damage and preservation issues.
the library of congress launched its pioneering digitization efforts in 1994 through the american memory project, starting with photographic collections.
this initiative has expanded to include over 100 digital collections, many of which feature multimedia and thematic content.
while most collections are digitized versions of existing library of congress materials, thematic collections like band music from the civil war era and the american variety stage bring together items for online presentation for the first time.
currently, various types of resources, such as journal article pre-print servers and lists of links on web pages, are now being labeled as digital or electronic archives.
despite this shift, the conventional professional archive continues to play a crucial role in research collections, with efforts underway to digitally convert some of these archives while preserving their original purposes and structures.
concurrently, informal interpretations of the term are on the rise, and fresh scholarly interpretations of the concept are emerging.
a thematic collection differs from a traditional library as it is curated specifically for inclusion in a digital library or can stand alone without being part of any formal library or institution.
unlike libraries, which house various collections and are dedicated to providing access and maintaining the resources, thematic collections typically do not possess the same cohesive structure or specialized features due to their more focused scope and audience demographics.
the library holds a wide range of primary and secondary materials focusing on the early modern period.
an outstanding thematic collection within perseus is the pre-twentieth-century london segment, drawing from the bolles collection on the history of london.
this section digitally recreates a specialized collection known for its thematic cohesion and diverse content.
as mentioned before, it connects london maps, pertinent texts, and historical and modern illustrations of the city.
it is evident that there is a significant intersection between digital libraries and thematic collection initiatives, with the terminology evolving alongside variations and hybrids.
digital research libraries are expected to persist in acquiring collections created by scholars, collaborative groups, and institutions, as scholars' endeavors expand to incorporate and expand digital special collections.
a noteworthy result of this development is that the proficient arrangement of research materials by scholars is introducing a valuable new resource layer to humanities research collections.
in the past, scholars primarily utilized collections for their research and also authored contributions to collections.
however, their involvement in constructing collections was restricted.
they curated personal collections for individual use and organized materials by editing and publishing collected works.
conversely, the establishment of collections has consistently been a crucial aspect of the responsibilities of library professionals, archivists, and curators.
the connection between scholars and collection experts has significantly influenced the evolution of research library collections.
scholars, as the primary group served by research libraries, have shaped collection strategies at research institutions through their inquiries, demands, and ongoing academic activities.
scholars have notably contributed as creators of intellectual works, forming a substantial portion of research collections.
presently, scholars are also actively involved in building research collections, fostering a pivotal transformation in the future formation of expansive research materials.
libraries have not yet established a systematic approach to gathering collections created by scholars.
this is partly due to the novelty of this type of content and also because meta-collecting is an unfamiliar concept.
currently, most research libraries do not acquire or index non-commercial digital content available on the web.
for instance, as of now, worldcat, a significant database of library resources, shows that 263 libraries have acquired and catalogued a recent critical book on william blake by william vaughan.
in contrast, only 26 libraries have included the william blake archive in their collections.
by way of illustration, 34 libraries have listed voice of the shuttle in their catalogues.
this humanities gateway, while widely accessed, differs from the scholarly works typically amassed by libraries and thematic collections.
to overcome the gap, research libraries should establish mid-range collection services that group thematic collections into relevant aggregations.
a mid-level research collection should differ from the existing digital research library, focusing less on top scholarly journals, major indexes, general references, or disciplinary canons.
instead, it should offer access to clusters of top-quality thematic research collections that match the institution's scholarly pursuits.
as the legitimacy of scholar-created research collections continues to gain acceptance, their numbers are expected to rise.
research libraries are still adjusting to how this trend will influence their operations, and there may be a delay before we see a convergence of scholar and institution-generated collections.
a broader appreciation for thematic collections as a valuable scholarly activity is essential before this can happen.
scholars and scientists are increasingly creating numerous digital products, many of which are high-quality compilations, supported by funding agencies.
research libraries will need to adapt their collection development strategies to accommodate this trend.
furthermore, universities must allocate resources to support this type of research as collection building becomes a more prominent scholarly endeavor.
currently, the necessary materials and expertise for collection building are scattered across various departments, libraries, and computing centers.
scholars are increasingly adept at digital collocation and are creating revolutionary research environments, reshaping the concept of collection development.
thematic collections are not just tools for supporting scholarship but are actively shaping it.
they offer curated groupings of research materials that effectively highlight the connections between various sources and subject areas.
by utilizing contextual mass, interdisciplinary platforms, and activity support, thematic collections enhance the depth, adaptability, and engagement of formerly fragmented and stagnant content repositories.
not only do they facilitate the generation of new research, but they also have the capacity to significantly enhance the scholarly research process.
thematic collections play a crucial role by integrating research materials into the inquiry process, thus making the scholarly landscape more apparent within the collection.
through this integration, the collection reflects the questions and methodologies driving scholarly investigations, highlighting a visible representation of scholarship.
furthermore, as scholars collaborate to develop these collections, the networks of researchers and institutions contributing to a specific research field are illuminated.
in today's digital age, thematic collections significantly enhance research resources, enriching the existing materials and creating novel prospects for the field of humanities scholarship.
in this chapter, i will explore the connection and assert that grasping the intricacies of this relationship necessitates an examination of scholarly practices and the utilization of resources.
this investigation extends to how information is applied, whether through computational means or traditional print, within the broader landscape of scholarly pursuits.
it is essential to contemplate our approach to interpreting texts and visual materials to appreciate the ongoing significance of print, and its interplay with digital counterparts and reproductions.
i am currently at the byzantine museum, where i am being presented with some of the treasures from this northern greek city that boasts the longest period under continuous byzantine rule.
the museum is brimming with icons, mosaics, marble carvings, and elaborately painted tombs.
while admiring these artifacts, my guide inquires about my opinion, emphasizing that their interpretation is crucial.
i come across a tomb featuring a painted tree providing shelter to a plump bird resembling a turkey, though it is, in fact, an olive tree symbolizing eternity and peace, with the bird representing a peacock, a symbol of paradise.
it becomes evident that these pieces are not merely decorative but carry profound symbolic meanings.
the icons radiate vibrant colors that captivate me, with each hue bearing significance: the golden backdrop signifies heaven and eternity, a red cloak symbolizes love, and a green band adorning the madonna's head represents hope.
the painted wrinkles on her face serve as a symbol that true beauty originates internally and remains unaffected by the passage of time.
as my mentor challenges me to identify what lies before me, i find myself struggling to recall the unfamiliar visual language being introduced to me.
it dawns on me that my dependency on written text and the absence of these evocative visuals have hindered my ability to understand this form of communication.
this symbolic imagery represents a distinct tradition deeply rooted in ancient greek culture, which has endured alongside the prevalence of written language yet has not been entirely replaced by it.
i serve on the advisory board for the portsmouth record office.
over the course of many years, they have diligently created nine edited printed volumes that document some of the contents of their archives.
these volumes are organized thematically, covering topics such as dockyards, historic houses, and legal documents.
each volume is elegantly presented in hardback format with its unique design.
despite having a sizeable number of volumes still being prepared, the increasing cost of printing has led the office to opt for electronic publication.
our discussions often revolve around forthcoming volumes, and we are all pleased to learn that the next volume, after three decades in the making, will soon be available.
there is a mutual culture shock experienced from both perspectives.
i am surprised to learn about the extensive duration that editing and publishing processes require.
while thirty years appears lengthy, an average of a decade seems common.
i contemplate the historical significance of the papers, which persist in archives, ready to be unearthed even without specific scheduling.
transitioning back from the fast-paced technological advancements i am accustomed to, it's challenging to adjust to the slower pace and lesser sense of urgency in this context.
i maintain the view that the concept of distinct volumes is unnecessary in digital publications.
unlike print volumes, there is no requirement to establish a publication schedule.
instead, we can release data on various themes simultaneously in multiple installments as soon as it is prepared.
this approach allows the digital records to expand according to the pace of the editing process, thus preventing any unnecessary delays.
while these suggestions are met with enthusiasm, the series editor cautions us about the human aspects involved in this process.
editors of individual volumes may desire recognition for their work as a distinct entity, crucial for acknowledgment from funding bodies or review panels.
moreover, it is noted that these collections would feel incomplete without an introduction, typically crafted at the end.
this task is a significant intellectual endeavor and could potentially have contributed to publication delays, given its requirement to synthesize a broad array of sources and convey their historical significance.
the author privately ponders if releasing the data without an introduction temporarily is an option worth considering.
exploring various approaches to presenting the data from different perspectives may help address these challenges, with both parties making intellectual adjustments that are perceptible.
as the use of digital resources began gaining prominence, there was a belief that these resources could and should replace the traditional practice of interpreting printed materials through reading.
advocates supported digital resources and criticized those hesitant to embrace them as misinformed or resistant to technology.
in the 1990s, initiatives were launched to educate scholars on digital resources.
universities established learning media units to assist in resource production and offered technical support to academics, although this support remains insufficient in the british academic system.
the availability and quality of digital resources in the humanities improved over time.
despite this progress, printed scholarship remains relevant.
scholars in the humanities continue to emphasize reading books and writing articles, alongside using or creating digital resources.
i observed during my time in portsmouth that cultural norms in academia evolve slowly.
print publications still hold considerable authority.
this prompts the question: why is this collection published in book format?
consequently, there is a risk that enthusiasts of humanities computing may be perceived by their more traditional peers as overzealous technophiles who simply dabble in computers and digital resources because they can.
they might be viewed as indulging in technological gadgets while their peers engage in the challenging task of interpreting texts without the aid of technology.
since reading holds a high value and remains a common practice, it is essential for humanities computing practitioners to also take reading seriously to be regarded as serious scholars.
the incident at my portsmouth meeting illustrates that both sides of the argument tend to hold specific assumptions about scholarly practices, highlighting the necessity for mutual understanding and appreciation of these assumptions to progress collaboratively.
given that reading remains a persistent activity among academics, even after the adoption of digital resources, it is crucial to consider what reading signifies and the nature of the materials being read.
moreover, a challenging aspect lies in the interpretation of the analysis results.
a key principle in developing automated information retrieval systems is the prerequisite for a researcher to have a predetermined search objective.
this ensures that they can configure the system to identify and recognize the sought-after criteria and fully grasp the efficiency of recall.
in contrast to social scientists or linguists, scholars in the humanities often delve into texts without a predefined search target, making it challenging to ascertain the significance of their findings.
computer systems excel at locating specific features, presenting a dilemma since researchers can only gain this insight by extensively studying the text and potentially others.
otherwise, it becomes arduous to decipher the outcomes of computer analyses or pinpoint the right inquiries to pose regarding the text.
having a digitized version of a transcribed manuscript enables us to access its contents.
it is often through viewing a digital image that scholars recognize the additional possibilities for interpretation that exist, which seem to be best explored through the physical artifact.
the complexity of this process means that we have not yet comprehensively grasped its full significance.
it is crucial to consider the type of resources utilized by humanities scholars.
this consideration helps in understanding the ongoing intricate relationship between print and digital resources.
the suitability of digital resources may not always align with the requirements of humanities scholars or the tasks they wish to accomplish.
despite this, printed materials still serve various purposes, potentially motivating scholars to disseminate their research through traditional publishing methods.
however, it could be contended that leveraging computational techniques could offer more advanced and nuanced approaches to analyzing such content.
despite its seemingly straightforward nature, reading remains a fundamental aspect to be explored.
the art of pattern making in language is such that the significance of a word can be influenced by its placement in a text and the response it triggers in the reader.
for instance, dramatic irony succeeds in communicating unacknowledged meanings in a character's dialogue.
our ability to grasp this hinges on the mental associations and resonances it stirs.
language gains depth and richness through its connections and the contexts in which it is employed.
however, the intricate patterns produced by human readers pose a challenge to replicate through computational analysis.
text analysis software typically isolates the specific phenomenon being studied from its broader context, focusing only on the immediate surrounding words.
for example, a linguist might compile instances of a particular phenomenon and organize the findings in a concordance sorted alphabetically, regardless of their original sequence in the text or their authorship.
yet, for a literary critic, recognizing these patterns is essential to interpreting the text and deriving meaning from it.
consequently, the fragmented nature of computer analysis tools falls short in capturing the depth of meaning that comes from interpreting a word within the context of a narrative structure.
hence, the reason for the continued coexistence of print resources alongside digital ones should be evident.
the primary task of a humanities scholar is to comprehend and analyze texts, and attempting to mimic the nuanced and intricate process of human interpretation using computational tools seems rather redundant.
engaging with a physical text involves a refined and intricate analytical approach.
thus, it is not unexpected that scholars tend to view digital resources and computational methods that merely imitate the act of reading as a feeble replication of an already effective technique.
for digital resources to be beneficial to humanities scholars, they need to offer a distinct dimension that has the potential to transform our perception of the source materials.
the impact of this development and the increasing popularity of graphical user interfaces has reminded us of the significance of images, not just for organizing information, but also for effectively communicating it.
similar to the artworks displayed in the museum in thessaloniki prompting a different perspective on interpreting and conveying ideas, we have needed to rediscover how to analyze an image, whether it portrays a painted masterpiece or a digitally created icon.
the decision on the significance of such movement and its implications for the play is left to the critic, but the program has effectively brought about a useful sense of defamiliarization, a concept challenging to envision in print media.
a comparable method of visually representing textual information is evident in the interactive 3-d model of dante's inferno, also contributing to a defamiliarizing effect.
this fresh perspective on the text motivates readers to revisit the printed version with a renewed outlook.
the digital resource does not render reading obsolete but instead opens up new avenues for interpretation.
notably, this project is in progress at iath, the research center associated with mcgann and ramsay, bridging the gap between digital resources and conventional scholarly practices.
some other historians argue that in order to fully grasp the complexity of the subject area, anecdotal sources and printed texts should be utilized in conjunction with research findings.
they suggest that problems arose due to excessive dependence on numerical data analysis, which implies that it alone could provide a definitive explanation of slavery and resolve controversies stemming from subjective human interpretation.
projects like valley of the shadow mark a significant advancement not only in computational methods but also in scholarly approaches.
by integrating numerical data with textual and spatial information, these projects offer interpretive tools that supplement the historian's analysis rather than replace it.
humanities scholars work with intricate materials that contain nuanced meanings which can be challenging to decipher.
the processes of interpretation involved are intricate and multifaceted, and we are just starting to grasp their complexity.
despite the apparent simplicity of reading a text, it is actually a highly complex task that current computer analysis struggles to emulate.
this insight helps us appreciate why many scholars will likely continue to rely on reading printed materials as a fundamental aspect of their research endeavors.
digital resources, although not intended to supplant the cognitive abilities of scholars, can significantly enhance their work.
instead of serving as a replacement for the human mind's analytical capabilities, computer-assisted delivery of resources can function as a valuable support tool.
the utilization of visual aids to preserve memory and convey information was well-understood in ancient times, evident during my exploration of the icons in thessaloniki.
while much of this expertise got overshadowed by the text-centric nature of print culture, the graphical interface of computer screens has facilitated a reconnection with the visual realm.
this has allowed us to rediscover a forgotten language of interpretation.
by offering a fresh perspective, digital resources enable us to discern the intricacies of interpreting humanities materials in a new light.
this novel approach to examining texts can liberate readers from the confines of physical print, even if it ultimately guides them back to the pages of traditional books.
a remarkable paradox unfolded as many european directors absorbed valuable lessons from watching american films.
despite not understanding english, they keenly observed the visual storytelling techniques employed in these movies, uncovering a dynamic visual vitality often overlooked by american audiences and critics fixated on plot.
these filmmakers not only embraced the american cinematic style but also offered a distinctive counterpoint, skillfully evading the commercial pressures prevalent in the american studio system that viewed films merely as products for consumption.
the influence of the french new wave's innovative writing and filmmaking technique gradually made its way to britain and eventually the usa, triggering a compelling reverse effect that prompted emerging american film scholars to reevaluate their own cinema, which had been largely dismissed and forgotten.
in the early days, the focus was on what was taught and studied.
the auteur theory presented the film director as the pivotal creative force behind a movie rather than just someone to worship.
this theory proved to be a valuable tool for analysis.
by identifying specific stylistic and thematic characteristics associated with a filmmaker, one could delve into understanding and dissecting their work.
alternatively, adopting a foucauldian perspective, the auteur concept could emerge from a body of films.
by scrutinizing a director's oeuvre, patterns and methods of cinematic storytelling recognizable across different films could be revealed.
since the 1990s, numerous academics have ventured into exploring different forms of computer depictions.
i personally credit stephen mamber for sparking my interest and that of many others in utilizing computers to analyze movies.
mamber's pioneering work led to the most captivating and intricate computer-assisted cinematic analysis known as the "digital hitchcock" project focused on hitchcock's the birds.
this project began with mamber gaining access to the film's script, storyboards, and other related materials through the academy of motion picture arts and sciences.
creating software from the ground up, mamber crafted an impressive display: he initially showcased the first frame of each shot from the film all on a single screen.
essentially, the entire movie is visually represented by a still image of every shot, each of which can be interacted with.
clicking on a still image reveals the complete shot for further exploration.
the program featured interactive elements that enabled users to create a montage cell from eisenstein's potemkin, visualize classical hollywood three-point lighting by adjusting key, fill, and backlighting on a figure, and navigate through a sequence in vertigo to understand how camera movements and framing convey a narrative distinct from the character's perspective in the film.
additionally, it included a glossary function where users could click on hotwords within the text to access definitions of terms.
i would like to emphasize that concerns related to intellectual property should not be the primary barrier to incorporating moving images into educational or academic projects.
there are various avenues available to obtain necessary materials, even if they may not always align with preferences.
fair use principles should be upheld for in-class educational purposes, inclusion of digital images in books, and, following the enactment of the teach act, for broader educational dissemination.
there has been a shift towards increased flexibility from studios, possibly influenced by the rise of dvd formats and the unexpected popularity of their "supplementary material." dvds present a new realm for advancing digitized media in film studies, offering potential relief for copyright issues.
the introduction of the search function in film analysis presents a unique challenge.
it essentially transfers some essential analysis tasks to the program user.
this shift raises complex critical and practical queries, with a fundamental one being: what will the user seek in their search?
should we anticipate user needs when building the database, setting up a predefined list of keywords for users to search, and ensuring their presence in relevant database fields?
could we include such a list within the program, possibly as part of the introductory materials, to guide users on potential search queries?
unlike using a web search engine like google, where we generally have a clear idea of our search intent despite potential mismatches in results, using a film database interface and speculating on user search intentions presents a distinctly different challenge.
to fully enhance our capabilities, we require a program that can directly scan images.
this would involve categorizing images in the database and conducting searches based on these tags.
essentially, we could specify details regarding the image's content, color, arrangement, and thematic significance and permit users to select these criteria to pull up related images or scenes.
the emerging mp7 codec offers a promising feature of tagging the image itself, rather than relying solely on text annotations.
however, the current methods are still reliant on textual descriptions appended to the images for search purposes.
while there exist tools to retrieve still images by similarity, such as selecting an image to find others with comparable colors or shapes, these are sophisticated tools not readily accessible to film researchers.
exploring moving images through search functions presents a unique challenge.
for instance, being able to browse through a database of short cuts to locate specific zoom shots by simply clicking on a similar example could revolutionize the analysis of a film's narrative, a filmmaker's signature style, and, significantly, help us grasp the fundamental principles of cinematic representation.
while software for searching moving images is gradually advancing, a kodak researcher once remarked to me, "it won't happen in our lifetime." however, this conversation took place six years ago.
by transforming thoughts into visible written sentences, writers alleviate the burden of having to remember their creations.
by externalizing words, phrases, and sentences, they can freely delete, rearrange, alter grammatically, and substitute elements as needed.
this process requires dedicated focus to execute these tasks effectively.
through converting inner speech into visible text instantaneously, writers feel acutely aware of the mental process of composition, even though it remains opaque, particularly to experienced writers.
beginners, mastering linguistics, may painstakingly construct utterances in their memory before verbalizing them.
novices conscientiously engage in this task, potentially able to articulate the conscious steps they take, delve into their memory, and mentally refine their composition before speaking.
this preparatory approach, understandable to any native speaker, demonstrates a methodical process in formulating sentences in one's own language.
writers who reflect on their inner thought processes while crafting and vocalizing sentences are accurate in describing the "voice" they hear as formless.
when we listen to someone else speaking, we are not truly hearing their voice but rather our brain's own interpretation of it.
it's clear that various brains could interpret the same speech sounds in divergent ways, resulting in different perceptions of the words being spoken.
in this way, the mind serves as an interpreter of creations produced through a mental procedure, taking on an ethereal and occasionally peculiar voice.
cognitive sciences support authors' impressions of the language-making process as being elusive and inaccessible.
the inner voice articulates sentences that seem to materialize out of thin air.
the fact that we perceive this voice implies that we are eavesdropping on another rather than ourselves; an anonymous, unidentifiable figure who remains somewhat removed and beyond analysis, akin to listening to a voice on a radio.
these mental images serve as a kind of recollection of the process of performing a task, constructing verbal expressions from natural language, where we are unable to link this recollection process to our own identity.
this process is a paradigm of the expert mind failing to pay attention to its own actions.
when we are engaged in composing, we are unable to rectify this disregard, unlike when we are driving a car and suddenly snap back to awareness, realizing we have been on autopilot for a distance.
we cannot voluntarily summon an awareness of how our minds generate verbal expressions.
why is it so elusive for us to remember the process of constructing a sentence?
what causes the mind to be hindered by implicit memory when trying to grasp this fundamental aspect of human communication?
the explanation may be rooted in the nature of our mnemonic capabilities.
our hippocampus, the center for long-term memory formation, can retain information such as language, visuals, sounds, emotions, and thoughts, but not neural processes.
suggestively, we do not rely on recalling the specific activities within the language-processing regions explicitly.
during our cognitive development, these centers lack designated names for the entities and operations taking place.
while not entirely inaccessible, this knowledge might be deemed nonessential and potentially obstructive to our survival instincts.
louis milic, a few decades ago, proposed that stylistics should move away from impressionism towards using quantitative measures.
since then, researchers have gathered numerical data on style and attempted to explain how it sheds light on literary works and their authors.
cognitive stylistics argues that individual minds, not literary texts, possess style when expressing themselves.
it suggests that personal styles are heavily influenced by the neural limitations that govern mental language processes.
because analyzing minds directly is challenging, stylistics needs to conduct research at the intersection of cognitive sciences and corpus linguistics.
cognitive psychology and neuroscience provide insights into what to anticipate.
corpus linguistics identifies quantitative text features for analysis based on human sciences predictions.
several trial literary analyses were conducted to investigate if characteristics in the works of two english poets, geoffrey chaucer and shakespeare, could be explained using the standard cognitive model of language processing.
the studies involved using texts with standardized spelling, not phonetically transcribed due to the incomplete understanding of middle and early modern english pronunciation.
the software utilized, collgen, was only able to capture recurrent fixed phrases and node-collocate pairs, while groups of three or more collocates were not included.
despite these constraints, the published findings of the analyses generally supported the idea that the writing styles of both poets could potentially be linked to cognitive processes and partially deciphered.
various examples demonstrate the practical applications of cognitive stylistics.
in one study, chaucer's repeated phrases in the general prologue were compared with those in the other tales.
interestingly, despite different lengths, it was observed that the general prologue had more repeated phrases in common with an apparently unrelated tale, by the manciple, which always preceded the last tale by the parson.
this finding led to the speculation that chaucer may have written these works in the same year.
another example involved analyzing the 107 repeated phrases in agamemnon's speech in shakespeare's troilus and cressida, which shed light on the rationale behind an unusual sequence of images.
by examining passages from earlier poems and plays, researchers were able to uncover hidden associative connections that were previously unrecognized.
the introduction of the printing press extended the narrative length, rejuvenated the episodic structure characteristic of epic poetry to suit the expansive format of books, made traditional mnemonic aids redundant, and paved the way for the emergence of the novel.
this new literary form allowed for intricate plot developments, including framing, embedding, branching, digressions, disruptions of chronological order, and the incorporation of multiple storylines.
leveraging the spatial layout of the page, illustrations began to complement textual content, and visual elements were progressively acknowledged and utilized as a means of expression.
given these advancements across historical stages, one may ponder: what novel innovations remain for digital media to explore within the realm of storytelling?
the digital platform provides a more robust tool for constructing multivariant narratives compared to random combinations or unconditional forks, as the transition between text segments can be carefully dictated through programming.
in a hypertextual environment, clicking on buttons triggers the execution of specific machine-language commands, such as a "goto" command directing to a particular memory location and instructing to display corresponding data.
this "goto" command can be integrated within an "if .
else" statement to enable conditional branching.
for example, from the node "hero arrives at castle," the system could be programmed to present either the nodes "hero marries princess" or "king assigns hero a mission to rescue princess," contingent on whether the reader has previously explored "hero defeats villain." reconstructing a coherent narrative world from a jumbled discourse could easily become monotonous if the reader were merely seen as a metaphorical piece in a jigsaw puzzle.
any image can be fragmented, boxed, and marketed as a puzzle.
if hypertext were strictly compared to puzzles, it would imply that the reader's participation is detached from the narrative message of the text.
in literature, the most effective hypertexts are those that succeed in presenting the reader's navigation through the network and reconstruction of the narrative as a symbolic act imbued with a specific meaning tailored to the text, a significance not pre-determined by viewing the medium as a preconceived statement.
the presence of hypertext in a text does not inherently make it groundbreaking or meaningful; the responsibility lies on the author to employ it in shaping a distinct textual concept or metaphor that assigns purpose to the reader's engagement.
in "victory garden," this engagement is depicted as an exploration of space.
in interactive fiction, players take on the role of a character in the story world and direct their actions by typing commands in a simplified form of natural language on a traditional command-line interface.
a parser interprets the input and the system reacts with suitable, and occasionally humorously mismatched, actions.
typically structured as adventure games, most interactive fictions involve the player's character undertaking a specific task, with the full plot unfolding as the player solves various challenges to succeed in their mission.
while interactive fiction (if) permits users to input any text but restricts acceptable commands, first-person shooter (fps) games incorporate all user actions within the game mechanics, limited to activities like movement, collecting ammunition, weapon selection, and aiming and shooting.
each playthrough can be likened to crafting a new "life story" for the character, generating a fresh narrative with every session.
this narrative unfolds dynamically through player actions rather than being purely narrated.
due to the complexity of game mechanics and processing speed, the player experiences partially unpredictable reactions from the system, resulting in a vast array of potential life stories for the character in fps games.
these narratives persist as virtual experiences until mentally revisited by the player, who typically recounts them using a conventional "diegetic" storytelling approach.
unlike the fast-paced lives of fps players, the sims offers narratives that can be enjoyed both in the moment and looking back.
through the game's system, users can create and share stories by capturing screenshots and adding text.
these player-created stories, often presented in a cartoon-style format, are frequently shared on the game's website.
while the subjective appeal of these narratives may vary, the fact that players feel compelled to share them underscores the narrative depth that computer games can evoke in their virtual realms.
the chapter discusses two contrasting aspects of textual phenomena on the cultural spectrum.
on one end, computer games have immensely impacted popular culture, thriving as a billion-dollar industry comparable to hollywood and disneyland.
on the other end, hypertext remains a niche academic genre primarily explored by theorists and aspiring writers.
bridging the gap in digital textuality involves navigating between the conventional narrative structures of mainstream culture and the anti-narrative stance of experimental texts.
this uncharted territory recognizes narrative as a dynamic source of knowledge and aesthetic experiences, avoiding stagnation or exclusion.
in the early 1990s, theorists championed hypertext as the future of digital literature, prioritizing non-linearity and spatiality in aesthetics.
however, it is crucial to acknowledge that narrative inherently relies on temporal and linear storytelling mechanisms.
nonetheless, our venture into digital humanities was a deliberate one.
while engaging in digital humanities has caused some who held relativistic views to adopt a more pragmatic stance due to the demands of technology, it has also reignited our shared focus on the core of our scholarly pursuits.
with the practical application of digital humanities advancing within libraries and archives to enhance collection management and dissemination systems, the realm of theory is being prompted to facilitate novel introspective initiatives.
the utilization of digital tools not only serves to expand research in the humanities but also prompts contemplation on the methodologies and foundations that inform our knowledge-seeking practices and our comprehension of how interpretation is constructed.
digital humanities initiatives transcend mere technical applications by fostering occasions for critical self-awareness.
can we prove that humanities computing transcends being merely a technical advancement, by positioning it as a pivotal turning point akin to deconstruction, cultural studies, and feminist ideologies?
this requires demonstrating that digital methods not only repackage subjects of analysis in new forms but also alter the foundational philosophies guiding our work.
the task at hand is to devise tools that actively involve and empower such examinations, rather than just facilitating superficial discussions about them.
despite digital humanities' current appearance of automation, viewed from a practical standpoint, much of its activities appear automated.
differing from augmentation, as articulated by douglas engelbart, a key figure in graphical interface development, automation implies the rigid application of technical knowledge guided by fixed principles.
once initiated, an automated system functions based on its set design, and its efficacy hinges on this initial setup.
before immersing oneself in the dizzying realm of speculative and 'pataphysical pursuits, it is beneficial to initially explore some conventional aesthetics frameworks.
these frameworks serve as valuable starting points for comprehending the challenges involved in incorporating visual methods of knowledge representation within digital humanities contexts.
key themes within descriptive aesthetics that significantly influence digital images include truthfulness, the inherent qualities or capacities of a particular medium, the cognitive aspects of aesthetics, and the purported moral enrichment derived from aesthetic experiences.
discussions around beauty will be set aside for now, unless they intersect with considerations of practicality and the frequently made differentiation between applied and artistic practices.
the concept that exposure to high-quality art and culture leads to individual and cultural betterment has persisted, whether viewed as personal development or improvement through appreciation of the "best" in art forms.
figures like samuel taylor coleridge, matthew arnold, and walter pater advocated this belief in the 19th century.
today, the humanities and fine arts are still frequently defended based on their presumed influence on moral enhancement.
the integration of "digital" technology into the humanities is at times hindered by persistent ideas of progress and improvement.
during the 1950s and 1960s, a host of visionary individuals such as herbert franke, melvin pruitt, jascia reichardt, and diverse research teams at bell labs including kenneth knowlton and leon harmon, were immersed in pioneering work across various fields like robotics, electronics, video, and audio processing.
they utilized cutting-edge technology to explore combinatorial and permutational techniques for creating poetry, prose, music, and other artistic expressions.
the impact of their innovative endeavors continues to reverberate today, with digital art thriving across all artistic domains, often blending modern methodologies with traditional practices to create a distinctive fusion of procedural techniques and artistic output.
an enduring and notable project embodying this concept is the aaron project by harold cohen.
serving as a showcase of artificial aesthetics and an endeavor to encapsulate artistic creativity through various layers of instructions, aaron stands out as a refined example of generative artwork.
the origins of aaron trace back to 1973, initially aligning with the era's artificial vision research.
at that time, there was a prevalent belief among vision researchers, like david marr in the 1970s, that a thorough understanding of perceptual processes could lay the groundwork for computational models.
however, as research advanced, it became apparent that perceptual processing alone was insufficient, and higher-order cognitive representations needed to be incorporated.
merely grasping "perception" was deemed inadequate, as cognitive schemata capable of evolving complexity also played a crucial role in elucidating the mechanisms behind visual cognition.
the prevailing outlook in the field of information design is primarily influenced by the belief that data precede visualization, where the role of visual design is seen as transforming a mental process into a visual one.
while the significance of skillful information design in interpreting statistical data cannot be overstated, it would be unreasonable to disregard its importance.
however, it is also important to recognize the limitations of this perspective.
this is because it confines the nature of knowledge by implying that information exists independently of its visual representation, waiting to be presented in its "optimal" form.
i have encountered digital humanists who view graphic design as a secondary task, involving the embellishment of information for public showcasing once the core analytical work on content, data structure, or processing algorithms has been completed.
challenging this mindset necessitates a reassessment of how information is fundamentally shaped by embodiment.
speculative computing is a technical term that aligns perfectly with the logical operations of technology.
it involves predicting potential outcomes along various pathways in data processing to enhance efficiency.
by forecasting the most probable future steps, processing is accelerated, leading to the discarding of unnecessary paths while new options are explored.
this speculative process does not eliminate choices but rather evaluates the likelihood of each course of action ahead of time, akin to making calculated bets.
it is a mathematical technique based on probability and statistics, devoid of any metaphysical or narrative influences.
grounded in logic and quantitative analysis, it is a refined form of applied knowledge that is entirely distinct from artistic expression or creative interpretation.
metaphorically, speculative computing can be likened to the concept of multiple possible worlds expanding from each point in the processing chain, reminiscent of the iconic radio signals in the old rko studios film logo.
from a narratological perspective, this approach mirrors the idea of a garden of forking paths, portraying computing as a narrative structured by interconnected nodes and branches.
in this discussion, i want to emphasize specific qualities and tools within temporal modeling, particularly in regard to how subjectivity, uncertainty, and interpretation are interwoven in every representation.
these aspects are seen as integral to speculative computing.
our design process overtly embodies this approach to information and software engineering.
we strive to draw inspiration not only from ontologies but also from imagery, aligning our philosophical research on temporal relationships with the exploratory and intuitive methods utilized by artists.
questions such as "how would you depict a leisurely day?" or "can you visually capture feelings of anticipation or regret?" are posed to artists to enrich our investigations.
as our foundational framework solidified, and we began formulating an initial notation system for temporal elements and variations, we consistently queried each concept presented: "what implications does this have?" and "what types of relationships could it convey?" a model serves as an interpretive representation of a specific dataset, reflecting the interpreter's perspective at a certain moment.
the adaptability of this approach is reminiscent of the intuitive and analytical aspects of traditional humanities at their finest.
nowsliding is the act of positioning oneself subjectively along a temporal axis in relation to different points, events, intervals, and dynamics that contribute to our understanding and experience of time.
it involves envisioning one's current reality in the present moment and then shifting to another evolving present moment as time progresses.
nowsliding also encompasses projecting and envisioning the future or reflecting on and analyzing the past.
through our toolset, this subjective temporal positioning and imaginative process can be visually represented through customizable timelines that change based on the position of a sliding icon symbolizing the subjective perspective.
this tool allows for the exploration of multiple independent or interconnected viewpoints within a single dataset, with the visual representation of nowsliding customizable according to the specific model being constructed.
humanists possess expertise in the abstract categorization and organizing of information essential for data modeling.
we are well-versed in algorithmic processes and can recognize the profound impact of visual and structural alterations.
when presented with an image or a graph, we believe we have a grasp on how to interpret them.
however, what remains unexplored in a thorough and organized manner is integrating the subjective perspective necessary for any act of interpretation into a computational, consciously visual setting.
the potential of speculative computing lies in its ability to enhance the techniques and results of digital humanities by facilitating this integration.
in chess, the pre-play level remains constant in theory.
nevertheless, players need to establish their own guidelines for assessing pre-play and gameplay possibilities, and these heuristic guidelines are expected to evolve with the player's skills.
currently, it appears that developers of chess engines, utilizing powerful brute force search algorithms, have yet to explore this deeper layer of chess expertise.
this involves the creative adaptation of rules that enable players not only to enhance their chess abilities but also to elevate their gameplay experiences beyond just the game itself.
art, similar to religion, serves as a gateway to something unknown, transcending our current comprehension.
artwork beckons us to venture beyond our existing selves and knowledge, leaving us suspended in an unfamiliar realm akin to the experience of manly.
it propels us to a realm just beyond our previous limits, to a place we deemed inaccessible.
the significance and joy of art may lie in its ability to elevate our understanding to a higher level, offering an alternative perspective on the world.
to develop intricate and sustainable digital humanities projects and publications successfully, it is crucial for scholars to be well-versed in both the research topic and the technology at their disposal.
the scholar must possess a clear and detailed comprehension of their intellectual goals and the resources needed to accomplish them.
additionally, a solid understanding of available technologies is essential for assessing their appropriateness in effectively representing and utilizing the resources to achieve the desired intellectual aims.
due to this dual expertise requirement, collaboration with technologists during the design and execution phases is often necessary.
these technologists bring diverse perspectives, experiences, and skills that complement the scholars' expertise.
collaboration, however, can be challenging as many humanists typically work in isolation, focusing on sharing research outcomes rather than the process itself.
collaborative design involves a methodical process of analyzing and defining concepts, often combined with creating prototype implementations to validate the accuracy and feasibility of the concepts.
while computers facilitate advanced data processing to generate desired outcomes, it is essential for scholars to meticulously analyze, define, and intricately represent the data.
every data element and relationship between data components must be clearly identified, named, and defined when input into the computer.
it is crucial that data inputs are accompanied by additional details that specify the data components.
this level of decomposition is vital for guiding the computer, through programs or applications, in manipulating the data to accomplish the objectives, which involves a systematic approach of locating, recognizing, and manipulating the data.
focusing solely on achieving short-term results may result in overlooking the importance of the longevity of content and its publication.
the constant evolution of computer technology poses challenges in the long term.
changes in both software applications and data formats may necessitate transitioning from one application version to another or even to a completely different one, along with migrating data to new formats.
while these changes may not immediately impact a project in its initial four to five years, they can become significant, especially for projects meant to be completed within three to four years.
most researchers and creators desire their work to remain accessible for several years following completion.
publishers, if involved, will aim to keep projects viable as long as there is a market demand.
the cultural heritage community, a vital part of scholarly communication, may view a publication as possessing cultural significance for future generations.
allocating human resources is crucial for the development, prototyping, and eventual execution of projects.
following implementation, additional resources are essential for maintaining the project's infrastructure.
human resources are also indispensable for data production and upkeep which involve identification, collection, analysis, creation, maintenance in a machine-readable format, and accuracy and consistency checks.
achievement of intricate and elaborate goals necessitates intricate and elaborate implementation strategies, production processes, and often extensive data categorization.
in most cases, the more intricate and detailed the project, the longer it will take to design, implement, populate with data, and sustain.
therefore, every objective involves associated costs, and these costs must be evaluated against the objective's significance.
some objectives, although valuable, may prove to be unfeasible due to their high costs.
design is a multifaceted process that necessitates an iterative approach due to its intricacies.
each iteration contributes to the development of a consistent and cohesive system.
attempting to analyze all factors simultaneously is impractical.
instead, both the comprehensive picture and the individual components need to be examined from various angles.
this sequential consideration prompts reevaluation of different aspects, leading to continual adjustments.
prototyping specific components is crucial to evaluating their economic, intellectual, and technological viability.
it is not uncommon to devise a seemingly effective solution based on a few factors, only to discover its failure when additional elements are introduced, compelling modifications or even abandonment.
successful design demands enduring persistence and patience throughout the process.
humanists analyze human-made objects to explore the essence of humanity from a specific viewpoint and within a defined context.
in this context, an artifact is broadly defined as any object crafted by humans.
these artifacts can be the main focus of study or can provide insights into human activities, events, and intentions.
archivists differentiate between objects deliberately created for a purpose and those created incidentally during human activities, often serving a functional role.
works such as novels, poems, paintings, and musical compositions are examples of objects created for their intrinsic value.
on the other hand, documents like court records, birth certificates, and correspondences are utilitarian artifacts serving as tools or evidence of specific actions.
although instrumental artifacts primarily serve as evidence once their function is fulfilled, artifacts created for their own sake can also serve as evidence.
one way to perceive a novel is as a significant literary entity possessing distinct aesthetic and intellectual qualities, serving as evidence for language usage, and offering insights into important cultural values within a specific historical period.
various academic fields exhibit mutual interest in comparable subjects or methodologies.
linguists and literature scholars might both focus on written works, including literary pieces, but differ in their interpretations of the texts' noteworthy features.
despite variations in the subjects of study, socio-cultural historical disciplines commonly use parallel research methods with a unified goal of achieving historical comprehension.
to integrate computer technology into humanities research effectively, it is crucial to convert primary artifacts or objects of interest and secondary supporting information into formats that machines can process.
these representations must mirror the researcher's disciplinary approach and techniques while catering to the analytical and communicative goals of the project.
the choice of representation method will vary based on the characteristics of the specific artifact being documented.
whether dealing with visual media, printed materials, mathematical equations, tables, audiovisual content, sculptures, architecture, or maps, each type of artifact possesses unique features that should be highlighted in the representations to support the research effectively.
the efficient processing of textual data by computer systems necessitates a sophisticated representation of the text beyond a simple character sequence.
to fully capitalize on computing capabilities, textual information needs to be broken down into its logical units, each unit precisely identified or named, and its boundaries clearly defined.
this decomposition and identification process is crucial for enabling precise and reliable text processing, allowing computers to accurately recognize and extract characters and character strings for specified operations.
while there are specialized applications designed for handling and manipulating numerical data, there are relatively fewer options available for managing and analyzing textual data, especially for sustaining intellectually rigorous humanities research due to their lack of appropriate characteristics and features.
analytical descriptive proxies are valuable across a range of projects.
for instance, archaeologists often handle numerous artifacts requiring meticulous cataloging.
this process entails systematically documenting an extensive array of information, often with intricate classification systems and standardized vocabularies.
database technology typically proves to be the optimal and efficient method for gathering, categorizing, comparing, and assessing artifacts across various mediums.
xml is a method of encoding textual content in computers through a descriptive or declarative approach.
unlike providing a ready-made tagset for direct application to various types of written pieces, xml establishes a standardized grammar for specifying rules governing the markup of a document class.
it defines conventions for naming components within documents, a syntax, and a metalanguage to articulate the logical structure and relationships between these components.
by adhering to these conventions, individuals or groups with aligned document goals collaborate to encode documents efficiently.
creating xml and database encoding schemes requires careful consideration of factors such as the scholarly viewpoint, the type and substance of the information being conveyed, and its intended purpose.
to illustrate, if there is a compilation of writings from various authors and the goal is to enable users to easily find and distinguish texts by a specific author, it is necessary to explicitly specify and delineate the author of each text.
similarly, all potential uses must be outlined, and suitable identifiers and structures should be integrated into the encoding schemes and the data being encoded.
essentially, xml and database encoding schemes serve as reflections of the designers' perspectives and comprehension.
each document type definition (dtd) or schema serves as an implicit assertion about the essence of the material being scrutinized and the methods through which it can be utilized.
the process of specifying an intended use involves the identification and definition of users and user communities.
while the researcher is typically the primary user, especially when the goal is to facilitate data collection and analysis for later publication of results and interpretations, this approach can limit readers' access to the resources and methods employed.
there is a growing consensus that computers and networks offer the advantage of enabling transparency and peer review of evidence and methodologies.
therefore, if sharing data and methods for evaluation is valued, the design should consider additional users.
generally, a narrower target audience facilitates a clearer definition of data usage, whereas a broader audience requires classification based on educational and intellectual levels.
in basic terms, querying involves users inputting words, phrases, dates, etc., to be compared with data.
the matched data or links to it are then returned to the user in an ordered list.
browsing is a form of querying where the author predefines the query and subsequent result list.
rendering is the conversion of machine-readable data into human-readable information.
all computer-based information, be it text, graphics, images, or audio, requires rendering.
some renderings are simple, directly converting machine data to a human-readable form.
navigational aids are akin to a book's title page or table of contents.
they convey the title, content, scope, and structure of a research collection, enabling users to access and navigate subcollections and individual elements like texts, graphics, images, videos, or audio files.
determining and specifying the querying, rendering, and navigational features to offer users should not solely rely on abstract or imaginative processes.
many creators of publicly available information utilize user studies to shape and enhance the design process.
aesthetics are key in effective communication, as seen in the traditional role of publishers in aesthetically designing publications.
the visual appeal and user experience of digital publications are equally crucial.
even though content takes precedence over design, overlooking aesthetics can hinder the effective communication of content.
researchers may consider involving professional designers to ensure a polished outcome.
while elaborate, professionally conducted studies may not be feasible for most researchers, making an effort to gather feedback from users is advisable.
it is essential not to postpone interface design until the end of the design phase.
following the digital capture of each resource, the capture files undergo editing to enhance quality and accuracy.
additionally, one or more derivative files may be generated.
these digital derivatives could involve simple alternative versions, such as creating smaller image files obtained from larger ones through sampling or compression to enable efficient internet transmission or cater to various needs.
derivatives may also utilize alternative representational technologies to enhance information usefulness or functionality; for instance, opting for an xml-encoded text over bitmap images of the original printed materials.
developing improved derivatives might serve as the primary research task, typically involving thorough analysis and editing of file versions.
moreover, intricate relationships within and across files and their components could be identified and documented or encoded for maintenance and control to ensure longevity.
these processes necessitate detailed documentation and management, which, in turn, involves recording comprehensive information.
descriptive data serves as a representation of an intellectual object.
it is crucial for identifying intellectual objects utilized in construction and those digitally depicted in a research assortment.
maintaining records and documenting sources and evidence utilized in research endeavors is equally significant in digital and traditional research formats.
for instance, when specific sources are utilized to produce a database describing individuals and organizations, it is imperative to document these sources even if they are not directly accessible in the collection.
typically, descriptive data comprises author, title, and publisher details, along with possible subject information.
when original traditional media is converted into a digital format, it is vital to detail both the original form and its digital counterpart.
although there may be some overlap in information, these two versions represent distinct manifestations of the same content.
traditional media are commonly housed in public archives and private collections alike.
ensuring accurate descriptions of resources is crucial, especially for distinct materials like manuscripts and archival records.
even copies, such as published books, have unique aspects in various nuances.
it is essential to document and connect repositories and collections, including a researcher's private collection, to each utilized or digitized resource.
by combining descriptive data with administrative details and relationship information, it fulfills a twofold purpose of recording the intellectual content and verifying the provenance and authenticity of the sources and their digital versions.
there are various hardware and software options designed for capturing conventional media, with the circumstances and setting during the capturing process being diverse.
even with the advantages of improved accessibility and analytical capabilities, digital capture invariably leads to the loss of some information.
take, for example, capturing an image of a book page, which fails to capture its tactile qualities.
the quality of hardware and software for capturing can fluctuate, and over time, they might experience a decline in performance.
nonetheless, there is ongoing enhancement and innovation in hardware and software technologies.
environmental factors during capture, such as varying lighting conditions or ambient noise, have an impact on the quality of the results.
the expertise and proficiency of the technician also play a significant role in the outcome.
different options are available with direct capture devices for images, sound, and video, which significantly influence the quality and level of detail in the captured information.
although ocr software can convert pixel characters into readable text, manual correction of recognition errors remains essential.
precise encoding of text elements necessitates human judgment and intervention, despite some automation being possible.
it is vital to document the tools, approaches, and technologies utilized in creating different data versions and variants, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the derived data.
legal frameworks, such as intellectual property and contract laws, safeguard the resources amassed in digital humanities projects.
permission from property owners is required to use such materials, and access must be governed according to agreements.
various initiatives are underway to establish digital rights management standards; however, it is premature to predict which will align with international regulations and gain widespread acceptance among users and developers.
there are various approaches to naming and addressing files, ranging from completely arbitrary schemes that are infinitely expandable to simpler, extensible schemes that offer valuable identifiers for file management.
for instance, in most projects where various artifacts are gathered from different repositories, each artifact may be represented by one or more digital files, including derivative files stemming from the original ones.
it is crucial to establish records for each repository or source collection.
these repository records will be linked to artifact records, and each artifact record will be connected to one or more capture file records, with each capture record potentially linked to multiple derivative file records.
in this context, a practical file-naming convention could involve a shortened repository identifier followed by three numbers separated by periods representing the artifact, capture, and derivative files.
the file-naming system illustrated here is straightforward, sustainable, and, despite its limited semantics, highly practical even without database queries.
all files originating from artifacts within the same repository will be placed together when sorted, ensuring the organization of related file versions.
furthermore, the sequence in which artifacts are identified and gathered will be reflected in the repository's sorting sequence.
it is important to note that the example offered is not meant to establish a standard protocol.
different collection methods, types of artifacts, and other variables may necessitate alternate and more suitable systems.
nevertheless, the key takeaway is that database technology is best suited for managing and overseeing intellectual and digital assets, while uncomplicated naming conventions and folder structures are not.
naming conventions should be straightforward in meaning and structure, with associated database entries containing thorough descriptive and administrative details.
connecting information is crucial both as a cognitive exercise and a managerial task.
linking intellectual items within and across documents involves generating explicit data that machines can interpret to automatically associate or group related content.
in this context, there are two primary types of relationships: intrinsic and extrinsic.
intrinsic relationship support is a characteristic of character-based databases and markup technologies.
database systems allow for establishing, managing, and utilizing connections between records or tables in a given database.
xml technology facilitates the establishment, management, and utilization of relationships between components within a specific encoded document.
it is essential to use this feature thoughtfully to safeguard the integrity of the relationships.
relations that are extrinsic exist outside the realm of databases and xml-encoded documents.
these connections can be observed between databases, between a database and xml documents, among different xml documents, between xml documents and files in alternative formats, and between various image or sound files.
despite the prevalence of extrinsic relations, current standards and standard-based software do not adequately support them.
there are numerous uncoordinated efforts to establish a standard framework for extrinsic relations, leading to challenges in constructing digital research collections.
particularly intricate are the relationships between resources managed by a researcher and those controlled by external parties.
during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, one of the most notable impacts of information technology has been the enhanced emphasis on collaboration.
successful collaboration yields numerous benefits on intellectual, professional, and social levels.
as opposed to individuals working in isolation, a collective of scholars collaborating can produce research compilations that are more intricate and inclusive.
the incorporation of diverse disciplinary viewpoints and expertise, sometimes even conflicting ones, facilitates broader and deeper analysis and comprehension.
collaborative efforts contribute to heightened productivity.
collaborating across humanistic and technological domains can result in more profound insights and sharper tools than what either discipline could achieve independently.
the explicitness and logical precision demanded by digital information representation and utilization highlight and subject traditional disciplinary assumptions to scrutiny, often leading to a more profound comprehension of our methodologies and their application to respective subjects.
working with technologists in digital humanities projects can pose its own set of difficulties.
while some technologists may have a basic knowledge of humanities, more often than not, they lack formal training in these fields.
the methods, viewpoints, and principles of humanities might be unfamiliar to them, and this lack of common terminology can impede effective communication.
any apparent mutual understanding will likely need thoughtful negotiation and clarification through ongoing conversations.
establishing a cohesive partnership will demand patience and determination, emphasizing the importance of building a shared vocabulary and a lasting mutual comprehension.
even with one individual leading a project, having a project manager or administrative assistant can be advantageous for overseeing coordination, monitoring deadlines, and other tasks.
successful collaboration hinges on creating a sustainable project framework.
while a single person may easily function within their own unique structure in the short term, it becomes more challenging for two individuals to do so, and even more so as more people are added and the project progresses.
for a collaborative project to thrive, it must embody characteristics such as standardization, documentation, and conscientious, iterative design, as consistently highlighted in various contexts throughout this chapter.
humanists rely on various data forms as primary source materials, necessitating thoughtful consideration of their digital capture concerning formats and the underlying materials.
while an exhaustive list is challenging to compile, it holds true that anything feasible for photography can be digitized.
certain materials lend themselves to higher fidelity in photography or digitization.
notably, in digitalization endeavors, many aim to reproduce the original faithfully, with some materials proving more successful in achieving this objective than others.
there is a growing fascination with the digitization of film, video, and sound, marked by significant advancements in creating time-based media in born-digital form for commercial use and digitizing analog originals.
an illustrative case is the star wars film series showing the evolutionary shift from analog to digital.
the initial three films were entirely shot in analog and subsequently underwent digital remastering before being released on dvd.
the final installment, attack of the clones, departed from tradition and was entirely captured using digital technology.
these seemingly simple structures can accommodate a wide range of information types, as intricate patterns can be constructed within them.
most primary sources can be digitally represented, enabling manipulation, analysis, transmission, and cross-referencing in ways not possible with analog formats.
while creating a digital copy of a text page is relatively straightforward today, extracting all alphanumeric characters, structural layout, and metadata elements automatically is a complex and advanced process.
representing alphanumeric symbols digitally is straightforward, and digital text has been in existence since the advent of computers.
another objective of digital conversion could be to preserve the essence of a source without focusing on replicating its appearance.
for example, a collection of a writer's works could be transcribed and revised in a digital format without meticulously adhering to the visual aesthetics of a physical print or handwritten copy.
alternatively, if the goal is to enhance the search functionality of a text while conserving its visual layout, the content could be digitized and linked to the corresponding image.
if preserving crucial structural elements in the digital rendition is essential and cannot be effectively achieved through automated means, or if a definitive version for print or electronic dissemination is intended from the digitized content, then utmost precision is critical.
alternatively, if the goal is to retrieve information from extensive text, opting to utilize the unprocessed ocr output from scanners may suffice.
today, various text retrieval tools enable searches on imperfect text through "fuzzy matching" methods.
yet, presently, this approach is only viable with appropriate linguistic and contextual dictionaries, making it predominantly applicable to english.
other languages with smaller speaker populations or linguistic characteristics predating 1900 are notably underrepresented in this regard.
a growing number of projects and organizations are opting to provide textual content in digital format using various hybrid solutions.
users are presented with a facsimile image of the original document for both printing and viewing purposes, accompanied by a searchable text file attached to each page.
this text file can be generated through rekeying, similar to the method used in the aforementioned eebo project, or via ocr with or without additional correction.
the choice of text production method relies on the condition of the original materials and the desired level of retrieval accuracy.
in the case of the eebo project, which covers materials from the 15th to the 18th centuries scanned from microfilm, ocr is not a feasible option.
given the anticipated uses, which involve intricate linguistic research requiring users to access specific words or phrases, utmost accuracy is imperative for this project.
available hardware options for digital capture include flatbed scanners, ideal for reflective and transmissive materials and capable of reaching resolutions of up to 5,000 dpi.
however, due to their high cost, most projects opt for scanners ranging from 2,400 to 3,000 dpi.
specialized 35 mm film scanners are designed for transmissive items like slides and film negatives and can achieve resolutions of up to 4,000 dpi.
although drum scanners offer superior resolutions and quality, their destructive process on original transparencies and higher unit creation costs limit their practicality for general use.
for diverse materials such as tightly bound books, manuscripts, art images, and three-dimensional objects like sculptures or architecture, digital cameras are recommended as they can capture details not easily scanned by flatbed or film scanners.
the operational procedures of scanning equipment differ, and this chapter does not aim to provide specific methodological information.
general guidance can be found in various books, while hardware manufacturers offer training manuals and online support.
for those interested in mastering digital capture techniques, it is recommended to pursue professional training either within their institution or by enrolling in courses provided by specialized organizations.
a list of such organizations can be found in the bibliography at the conclusion of this chapter.
it is crucial for projects and individuals to dedicate substantial consideration to the documentation of data right from the outset.
simply possessing archive-quality digital master files is inadequate if the filenames are indecipherable to anyone other than the creator and lack essential details such as the date of creation, file format, compression type, and so on.
these details are classified as technical or administrative metadata.
additionally, descriptive metadata encompasses the characteristics of the object being described and can encompass a wide range of attributes, including "title," "creator," "subject," "date," "keywords," "abstract," among others.
these are analogous to the elements typically found in a conventional cataloguing system.
professional studios or bureaux that capture materials are likely to include some administrative and technical metadata during the acquisition process.
alternatively, it may be feasible to request or provide project-specific metadata.
the addition of descriptive metadata necessitates expertise and a deep understanding of the source materials, making it a complex task to generate high-quality descriptive metadata.
previously, a notable text tool highlighted in this kind of article would have been the word processor.
presently, the word processor is widely used in and outside academic circles, making it unnecessary to elaborate on its advantages or varied applications.
nowadays, many individuals argue that the world wide web holds a pivotal role in humanistic computing, emphasizing the importance of sharing content on the www with a global audience.
while some tools discussed herein could enhance the creation of web content, the focus will not be on html or its implications.
instead, this article will delve into tools that can manipulate texts to bolster textual analysis and scholarship development rather than solely focusing on their preparation and presentation.
unsurprisingly, due to their markedly distinct origins, the two groups pose notably different challenges for humanities scholars who are just beginning to utilize them.
the initial set of tools, tailored primarily for text analysis support, are fairly comprehensible when working within a well-defined problem area.
in contrast, the versatile general-purpose tools are not as easily classifiable and can undertake a wide array of tasks on text.
these tools lack a specific problem domain focus like the "text analysis" tools do, comprising highly abstract elements.
novices may find it challenging to discern whether and how these abstract components can be employed to address a specific problem.
numerous standalone xslt processors are accessible for independent operation from web browsers.
these processors require the xml document and xslt stylesheet as inputs, saving the transformed results onto a local hard drive.
the resulting html files can then be served via any web server, enabling them to be viewed on any web browser after transformation.
two of the most popular xslt processors are saxon and xalan, optimized for execution on windows machines from the dos prompt.
proficiency in working with a dos window is essential for effectively utilizing these processors.
xslt, perl, and tustep are intricate and robust systems.
while certain useful results can be accomplished with some effort, mastering any of them efficiently and fully may require years of dedication.
software reviews in the humanities often discuss "user-friendliness." are these tools considered "user-friendly"?
if by that you mean are they immediately usable, then the answer is "no." however, are a good set of carpentry tools "user-friendly"?
they are indeed if you are proficient in using them.
similarly, these tools can effectively process texts, yet using them to their full potential demands a considerable level of expertise.
as he spoke, he revealed what appeared to be a jewel box.
the artist opened this ebony case and instructed annie to place her fingers on its edge.
she complied, but was startled as a butterfly emerged, perching delicately on her fingertip.
the butterfly displayed magnificent purple and gold-speckled wings, as if preparing for flight.
words fail to capture the grandeur, splendor, and intricate beauty of this object.
it embodied the essence of a perfect butterfly from nature, far surpassing the earthly counterparts, resembling those that grace the paradisiacal meadows where celestial beings frolic.
the exquisite down on its wings and the luminosity in its spirited eyes were truly awe-inspiring.
this concept is evident in markup languages like sgml and xml, where data is labeled with a descriptive schema and then displayed using external stylesheets or alternative "skins." these skins enable the easy interchange of visual themes on a webpage or desktop application.
by applying different skins, a basic mp3 player interface could transform into various forms like a vintage jukebox or a sleek crystal radio.
for instance, the css zen garden website showcases the impressive capabilities of stylesheets in presenting the same content in diverse layouts.
moreover, the recursive nature of interfaces allows us to use stylesheets for customizing data presentation, skins for personalizing browsing experiences, and desktop themes for enhancing the visual appearance of information spaces.
this highlights the distinction between interface and application that laurel and gelernter argue against.
within the realm of digital humanities, which involves exploring the diverse and extensive traditional cultural assets, it is essential to ponder on our role as creators of beauty.
nonetheless, as elaborated in the forthcoming section, the journey of being an artist can be challenging at times.
although their website is thorough and precise, it lacks user-friendliness and is cluttered with various unnecessary scholarly elements.
while these components hold value, they might detract from the focus on the primary content.
however, this site offers a unique collection of illuminated books that are easily accessible for reading.
it is worth noting that the site is continuously evolving and is expected to improve, especially with the increasing availability of broadband connections.
one issue was that users had to repeatedly scroll up and down the page to view images in sequence, along with related features such as transcriptions or enlargements.
the long vertical layout also meant that users couldn't keep both the top and bottom halves of the page visible simultaneously.
this became especially inconvenient in classroom settings, where instructors had to continuously scroll up and down to show students a series of images in order.
the addition of arrows in the lower part of the screen has now addressed this issue, providing a simple design solution to improve usability and eliminate unnecessary scrolling.
at the wba, we find that the technologies we engage with regularly assert themselves, challenging the interfaces we devise.
this challenge is especially evident in the field of digital humanities, where we often find ourselves repurposing tools and technologies created for different purposes and users out of necessity.
in this context, where interface design involves a back-and-forth between human and machine requirements, achieving usability becomes a delicate balance between these two elements, as i previously mentioned.
electronic enterprises face inherent risks, such as the potential for selecting inappropriate technology for a specific audience or discipline.
this can result from a lack of understanding regarding the target audience's readiness for new technology or misinterpretation of their preferences for presentation formats.
it is also risky to mismatch technology with content by forcing new tools onto existing materials or preserving outdated print constraints in modern presentations.
another risk is choosing technology unsuitable for a dynamic environment, leading to content being locked in a non-adaptive format.
additionally, investing in trendy yet impractical software or prioritizing aesthetics over functionality can jeopardize projects.
mistaking readers for buyers or conflating audiences with customers can also pose threats, such as assuming that attracting students to a website will persuade libraries catering to them to purchase the content.
relying too heavily on the novelty of e-publishing without a solid business strategy is risky.
each of these pitfalls can undermine publishers and projects, emphasizing the need for cautious decision-making in the electronic realm.
"we, as participants in scholarly communication, have the responsibility to thoughtfully consider the desirable attributes we wish to preserve from the existing system.
it is crucial that we establish dynamics that drive the development of a 'scholarly communication biosystem' that effectively supports academic pursuits." ultimately, we offer a business incentive to support the funding of publishing improvements.
the nap has been funding the creation of innovative software such as "special collections," as well as pioneering search and information discovery initiatives since 1999.
these tools are essential as they enhance the user experience on our website by effectively showcasing the value of our distinctive resources to readers.
our goal is to highlight this value, as any researcher visiting the site could potentially be the one out of two hundred who chooses to make a purchase.
viewing digital libraries solely as tools for convenient and expedited access to materials without the need to physically visit a remote repository is a limited perspective.
while digital technology typically aims to enhance and streamline existing processes, its broader impact often lies in facilitating entirely novel endeavors.
it is conceivable that digital libraries could empower upcoming humanities researchers to partake in unimagined scholarly pursuits.
many libraries have the responsibility of managing their collections.
while some may focus mainly on tasks like shelving and controlling circulation, most libraries also prioritize preserving at least a portion of their materials.
preservation plays a crucial role in the core duties of research libraries and special collections.
additionally, school, public, and special libraries typically maintain important local records and works over extended periods.
librarians are dedicated to ensuring equal access to information, viewing themselves as providers of knowledge for those unable to purchase it elsewhere.
the american library association actively opposed the communications decency act in court as it restricted library users' access to information available outside the library.
librarians have also played a key role in resisting the privatization of us government information, understanding that such actions would impede access for individuals unable to afford it.
consider a scenario where a book is comprised of numerous digital files, with each file representing a single page of the book.
to facilitate typical reader interactions, structural metadata is essential.
readers anticipate being able to access the table of contents, navigate to specific chapters, progress through the pages, refer back to previous pages, follow citations to the bibliography, return to the original text, and access footnotes conveniently.
these common reader expectations necessitate the presence of structural metadata to enable seamless navigation through the digital book.
administrative metadata play a vital role in ensuring the long-term accessibility of a digital work.
for instance, when dealing with a digitized book, this metadata would encompass detailed information about the various files essential for putting the book together, their specific locations, as well as the required file formats and software applications needed to access the book or its individual pages.
the significance of administrative metadata becomes even more pronounced during tasks like file relocation to a different server or when undertaking digital preservation activities such as refreshing or migrating data.
as we transition into building digital libraries, it is important to acknowledge that libraries are more than just repositories of works.
they encompass essential services and uphold ethical traditions and values integral to their roles.
collaborating with one another, libraries cater to diverse user groups and aim to endure long into the future while safeguarding users' access rights with privacy and anonymity.
for digital collections to qualify as true digital libraries, they must integrate a wide range of these services and ethical principles.
preservation plays a crucial role in fostering the advancement of an academic discipline and the professional growth of its experts.
progress in any field is contingent upon seamless communication among professionals, fostering a culture that values peer review and widespread dissemination of ideas with minimal barriers to research and publishing.
the advent of digital technologies has revolutionized communication within academic circles, connecting colleagues and facilitating interaction between educators and students across distances.
traditional challenges such as staying updated with remote colleagues or discovering relevant research in related fields have been mitigated by the emergence of tools like e-mail, listservs, and search engines.
while aspiring humanities scholars may gravitate towards innovative technologies to enhance their academic pursuits, those looking to establish a career in the humanities may encounter obstacles related to electronic publishing, peer review, and recognition for contributions in advanced humanities computing.
the trade-offs between preserving and accessing digital information mirror those of analogue materials.
when faced with the dilemma of how to conserve a frail book with crumbling pages or a broken spine, an individual must carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of investing in costly conservation treatment to protect the book as an artifact versus the more affordable alternative of digitizing the book's content through methods like microfilming or scanning, which may compromise some of the book's original physical characteristics.
it is crucial to identify the primary values of a particular resource to determine the most suitable preservation approach.
in this scenario, the decision hinges on whether one prioritizes the book's artifact value or its informational content.
this deliberation is equally relevant in the digital domain, where certain technologies may offer cost-effective, automated, and scalable solutions compared to others in the long run.
migration seems to be a viable option for uncomplicated formats where visual aesthetics are less crucial and some loss of data at the edges is deemed acceptable.
while other strategies have not yet undergone extensive large-scale testing over numerous years, having a variety of preservation methods at our disposal increases the likelihood of making informed choices about what content to retain and how.
there is no one-size-fits-all solution for safeguarding digital information, which could ultimately be a positive development in the grand scheme of things.
in contrast to the straightforward preservation of books, photographs, or maps, the digital realm presents a different challenge in terms of cataloguing artifacts.
without proper description and organization, unsorted digital sources may remain unnoticed for extensive periods.
once thoroughly catalogued, they become valuable resources.
while searchable text retrieval might be possible in the absence of detailed metadata in the future, ensuring the survival and accessibility of complex digital objects, especially multimedia content, relies heavily on accompanying accurate metadata.
the demanding requirements of digital preservation involve significant time and financial investment upfront, raising questions about who should bear these costs.
irrespective of the final result, it appears evident that individuals producing digital intellectual property should have a better understanding of the ramifications of overlooking longevity concerns during its creation.
scholars are encouraged to focus on essential information resources in their respective fields, by creating and adhering to necessary document standards crucial for their research and teaching, seeking guidance from preservationists and computer scientists when needed.
drawing from examples like genomics, which have incorporated professional informatics paths, scholars in the humanities stand to benefit as computational capabilities increasingly support humanistic research and education.
this role is not unfamiliar to the humanities, as seen in the nineteenth century when numerous esteemed scholars assumed leadership positions in libraries and archives, embodying the pinnacle of information expertise at the time.
in any field of knowledge acquisition, it is essential to acknowledge the reliance on previous work for advancement.
the ability to seamlessly refer back to sources is pivotal for academic or scholarly pursuits.
the responsibility for maintaining the continuity of links in an author's writing or a student's paper is often assumed to be facilitated by an unseen infrastructure, much like the provision of water when we open a tap.
though this infrastructure is not yet fully realized, unresolved issues related to persistence persist, such as the challenge of "versioning" – determining the appropriate iteration of a constantly evolving resource for preservation.
this dilemma mirrors concerns familiar to those in broadcast media and offers valuable insights for digital humanists through the well-established practices in audiovisual archiving.
in the field of sciences, various intriguing models for generating, organizing, and safeguarding digital information have been established by professionals in the discipline, with arxiv.org being a prominent example.
the transferability of this model to the humanities is challenging due to the lack of shared information resources in arts and humanities fields that are utilized by multiple research groups.
nonetheless, in instances where duplicate collections like journals and slide repositories are present in numerous academic institutions, paid services are being created to grant access to and preserve these resources through digital representations.
notable examples of such initiatives include jstor, amigo, and the in-progress development of artstor.
the effectiveness of these services relies on libraries and museums having faith in the provider's consistent management of the digital versions, allowing them to potentially eliminate surplus hard copies of journals or slides to attain economies of scale.
the statement underscores that humanists play significant roles as both creators and consumers of digital content, making digital preservation a key concern.
this involves safeguarding digital resources and fragile analogue collections by transitioning them into digital formats.
acknowledging the fleeting nature of digital data, it is imperative for humanists to address copyright issues, establish sustainable economic frameworks to support essential infrastructure, and ensure proper training for researchers and students in the humanities.
this equips them to conduct research, disseminate findings, and engage the next generation in exploring the diverse facets of culture fundamental to the humanistic discipline.
this article first elucidates the objectives and essence of qualitative research.
it reinforces earlier assertions by highlighting key studies that have enhanced comprehension of individuals with disabilities and the attributes of services tailored to cater to them.
subsequently, it outlines methodologies that can uphold the credibility of qualitative research.
it also emphasizes quality benchmarks that qualitative researchers must consider to uphold rigorous scholarly benchmarks.
finally, it encapsulates how three recent qualitative studies furnish compelling evidence that can guide policymaking and practical applications.
qualitative research delves into the attitudes, opinions, and beliefs of various stakeholders in special education and the wider community.
it also investigates personal responses to special education environments and educational approaches.
additionally, it provides insights into the environments that are beneficial for fostering successful learning outcomes and the life situations of individuals.
through qualitative methodologies, researchers can observe and record specific impacts of teaching and learning practices.
they can further examine how certain practices positively influence individuals with disabilities, their families, and the environments where they live, work, or study.
however, as mentioned earlier in this article, we emphasized that qualitative research can indeed be empirical and generate insights when research methods are applied systematically and thoughtfully.
in essence, we argue that qualitative inquiries have the potential to yield robust evidence that can influence decision-making and application in various fields.
qualitative research aims to generate evidence by delving into specific contexts and individual cases, rather than seeking generalizations.
the focus is on exploring particular situations, with the expectation that readers can identify parallels with their own experiences and assess the applicability of the findings.
the objective is not to provide universal truths or definitive guidance for policy-making or practice.
instead, the emphasis is on showcasing research outcomes to illustrate how they can support decision-makers and professionals.
in this concise overview of the intricate field of qualitative research, we aim to highlight the significant contributions qualitative research has made to the realms of special education and disabilities, emphasizing its enduring influence.
avoiding strict guidelines, we showcase a diverse array of qualitative studies and discuss ways to conduct them with credibility and trustworthiness.
we delve into the crucial quality indicators essential for the development, execution, and evaluation of qualitative research.
aligning with the stance of other contributors in this special edition, we stress the necessity of employing various research designs to address different research inquiries.
as proponents of qualitative research, we uphold the value of our own studies and those of our peers in special education as indispensable sources of evidence for informing both practice and policy.
two distinct types of noise influence nanomechanical measurements during the readout process.
the first, known as measurement noise, is unrelated to the resonator and is incorporated into the output signal.
this noise can manifest as electrical or photon shot noise in real-world scenarios.
the second type is the more nuanced back-action noise, which originates from the readout process and probabilistically impacts the resonator's behavior.
back-action noise may stem from fluctuating potentials or currents, which are then transformed by the transducer into physical forces acting on the mechanical device.
engineers specializing in electronics are well-acquainted with these noise types in linear amplifiers, denoting them as voltage and current noise.
for optimal performance, a carefully engineered link between the resonator and the amplifier is essential, ensuring the equilibrium of the two noise sources.
however, achieving the quantum limit remains challenging, even with optimized linear amplifiers, as very few can approach this theoretical boundary.
therefore, to attain quantum-limited positional detection, it is crucial to select an amplifier that theoretically offers quantum-limited detection and can be efficiently coupled to the mechanical resonator in practical applications.
the authors of this article advocate for a transformation in teacher education focusing on a new understanding of teaching.
they suggest that teacher educators must prioritize the practical aspects of teaching and explore innovative methods to assist beginners in honing their skills.
embracing the significance of clinical practice entails integrating teaching techniques that emphasize enactment alongside traditional reflective and investigative approaches.
the authors argue that breaking away from historical educational divisions is necessary for this paradigm shift, including bridging the gap between foundational theory and practical methods, as well as integrating university instruction with classroom experience.
additionally, they recommend restructuring teacher training programs around a central set of practices that cultivate knowledge, expertise, and professional identity as aspiring educators learn through hands-on experience.
establishing professional recognition for teachers encounters a hurdle due to the misconception that teaching appears simple despite its intricate nature.
with experience from observing classroom activities as parents and policymakers, individuals have had chances to witness teaching firsthand.
additionally, fulfilling roles like parents, volunteers in religious education, scout leaders, or managers often involves elements of instructing others.
hence, highlighting the intricacy of classroom teaching demands a comparison between everyday informal teaching practices and the structured instructional approach found in classrooms.
this article puts forward the perspective that teacher educators must focus on the practical elements of teaching and explore effective ways to assist beginners in acquiring expertise.
emphasizing the significance of clinical practice demands the incorporation of enactment strategies alongside the current methods of reflection and investigation.
to successfully implement this transition, it is essential to address longstanding educational divisions such as the separation between basic knowledge and instructional techniques in teacher training, and the divide between academic institutions and schools.
additionally, the article advocates for restructuring teacher education by centering it around a fundamental set of teaching practices that novice educators can cultivate during their professional training.
rather than presenting a comprehensive model for teacher preparation programs, these ideas are proposed as innovative and thought-provoking concepts for revolutionizing the approach to training new teachers.
in order to transform teacher education towards emphasizing core practices rather than knowledge domains, two key changes are essential for teacher educators.
firstly, they must revamp programs to integrate foundation and methods courses that have traditionally been taught separately.
secondly, teacher educators need to prioritize guiding new teachers in mastering a set of essential teaching practices.
these shifts will necessitate adjustments at both the pedagogical and structural levels of teacher education.
for instance, when guiding beginners to establish structures for collaborative student work, educators could instruct student teachers to allocate and clarify specific roles for engagement in a science presentation.
they could then rehearse methods for stepping in to aid students in fulfilling these roles.
additional simulated practice could involve exercises focused on predicting student comprehension.
as an illustration, novice teachers might transcribe a class conversation, adding annotations with their analyses of student remarks and potential questions they could pose to prompt students into expressing their ideas more thoroughly, verifying or disproving these analyses.
after observing a pupil, student teachers may be tasked with documenting a memo or concise report detailing the student's grasp of concepts, areas of difficulty, and suggestions for future in-class assistance or interventions.
this approach integrates various elements commonly covered in teacher training, including an emphasis on reading for comprehension, awareness of children's phonological and phonemic development, and the cultivation of oral fluency and understanding.
by applying these principles to a specific strategy, this practice equips new teachers with actionable insights they can implement right away.
teacher educators need to engage in challenging discussions and make tough decisions about which elements of the existing course curriculum can be sacrificed to concentrate more on a specific set of agreed-upon practices.
this adjustment may not demand a complete overhaul of the course structure but will necessitate educator retraining to entertain the idea that less coursework could result in more effective learning for students.
collaboration among educators should extend beyond closed-door program meetings to also incorporate ongoing public dialogue within their teaching practices, including discussions with future teachers, on how various perspectives like multicultural education and mathematics methods can be integrated to assist novices in mastering the art of facilitating mathematical conversations.
if teaching is acknowledged as a multifaceted skill that cannot be easily acquired independently, then it is essential for teacher educators to innovate and create efficient methods to swiftly equip regular individuals with the necessary skills to tackle teaching challenges.
reorganizing professional training around essential teaching practices would disrupt traditional structures in teacher education.
for instance, educator roles would need to evolve into being clinical mentors, adept not just at discussing teaching theoretically but also adept at offering constructive feedback and guidance to help beginners progress.
this transition would entail shifting from a curriculum that segregates theory and practice via separate foundation and methodology courses to one that prioritizes practical application in all aspects of learning.
numerous studies have confirmed the beneficial impact of special needs education training on teachers' attitudes.
findings from these studies show that teachers who underwent such training exhibited more favorable attitudes towards inclusive education compared to those who had received less training.
moreover, research has shown that teachers are generally more apprehensive about including students with learning disabilities, behavioral issues, and cognitive impairments.
conversely, teachers express more positivity towards including students with physical disabilities and sensory impairments.
the uae's energy system is a critical component of its infrastructure and economy.
the country has been investing heavily in diversifying its energy resources to reduce its dependence on traditional fossil fuels.
these efforts include the development of solar power plants and the exploration of nuclear energy as cleaner alternatives.
additionally, the uae has been proactive in implementing energy efficiency measures and promoting sustainable practices to ensure long-term energy security and environmental sustainability.
wave and tidal energy sources are currently scarce, but there is potential for utilizing sea currents, particularly along the gulf of oman coast where strong currents have been reported anecdotally.
moreover, tapping into the deep cold layers of the gulf of oman waters to provide cooling for nearby cities is another promising avenue worth exploring.
the assumption is that people's thoughts about emotions eventually translate into actual feelings.
the stearnses demonstrated a keen awareness of sociological theories from the 1970s and 1980s.
they were drawing from the insights of sociologist arlie hochschild, who contended that society could regulate emotions and their outward expression through "feeling rules" or "emotion rules" that dictated how individuals should feel and display socially accepted emotions.
hochschild exemplified this by explaining how airline stewardesses were trained not only to smile but to genuinely feel pleasant even when faced with rude passengers, an idea she termed the "managed heart." the stearnses aimed to explore past instances of managing emotions, which they discovered to have a superficial history.
to examine a society's "emotional norms," the stearnses proposed studying popular advice manuals.
the stearnses have explicitly excluded courtly love literature from being regarded as an emotionology because they believe it did not have a significant enough impact on popular culture or institutional structures to qualify as a genuine emotionology.
they argue that if courtly love literature, which was composed in the vernacular and recited orally by troubadours in southern france and other poets elsewhere, is categorized as merely part of intellectual history, then very little from the premodern era can be classified as true emotionology.
in criticizing jean delumeau's work "sin and fear," peter stearns scrutinized the book for predominantly focusing on how christian preachers emphasized and exploited the fear of death, questioning the extent of their effectiveness.
he criticized this approach as being excessively top-down history and noted the limited representation of laypeople.
ultimately, he concluded that the study still primarily resided within the realm of intellectual history.
in the united states, the study of modern emotions history can generally be categorized into two main groups: research focusing on the development of the "affective family" and investigations into "honorbased" societies found in regions such as the deep south in the united states and mediterranean cultures in europe.
historians examining the affective family often argue that during the middle ages and early modern period, familial relationships were characterized by emotional detachment, with the emergence of the loving family unit not occurring until the eighteenth century.
this perspective does not necessarily oppose the idea of excessive emotional displays in the middle ages, as the love within the affective family unit was believed to be controlled, subdued, and steadfast.
according to this interpretation, pre-modern families were primarily viewed as pragmatic social structures for procreation or, at worst, as settings for turbulent emotional outbursts.
in contrast, the modern family is typically seen as more sentimental.
emotions history has also drawn inspiration from regions like the south, both in europe and the united states.
edward muir’s work "mad blood stirring" represents a sophisticated application of the elias paradigm in this context.
the grand narrative is rooted in a well-defined theoretical foundation that centers on a specific model of emotions.
this model, which was prominent during the era of huizinga, febvre, bloch, and elias and continues to influence contemporary language and popular perceptions of emotions, is known as the "hydraulic" model.
according to this perspective, emotions are likened to vast fluids within individuals, churning and bubbling, eager for release.
the origins of this model can be traced back to medieval medical beliefs about bodily humors and are also consistent with the energy theories that were prevalent during the times of darwin and freud.
these scholars, including darwin, proposed the existence of a "nerve-force" that manifests during intense sensations, such as emotions.
similarly, freud discussed impulses that could be redirected, suppressed, or transformed, emphasizing the necessity of providing them with an outlet to prevent ongoing pressure.
the hydraulic paradigm resonates with our personal experiences of emotions and their expressions in language, as seen in phrases like "he flipped his lid," "i couldn't shake off my sadness," and "he redirected his anger into a productive endeavor." the theory, whether academic or based in common belief, posits that emotions are universally experienced.
it operates on the premise of a historical context, promoting a "binary" perspective where emotions are either fully expressed or suppressed due to societal, moral, or personal constraints.
the hydraulic concept underpins a dominant narrative that seeks pivotal moments driven by restraint.
nevertheless, this paradigm has become obsolete, having been largely replaced in the scientific community during the 1960s by two newer non-hydraulic theories.
in the cognitive framework, emotions are regarded as integral to the stages of perception and evaluation rather than as forces seeking release.
cognitive psychologists reject the notion that emotions are irrational, viewing them as outcomes of assessments regarding potential benefits or drawbacks, pleasure or pain, as perceived by individuals.
in summary, the diverse perspectives of various theorists converge on the initial step of judgment or "appraisal" in this process.
i would like to express my gratitude to romagnoli, tom rosenwein, daniel smail, stephen d.
white, and the ahr board of editors for their invaluable feedback on this article during the drafting process.
additionally, i am grateful to allen frantzen for suggesting that i present a version of it as a lecture for the loyola medieval studies program, and i extend my thanks to him, theresa gross-diaz, and the other audience members.
lastly, i want to acknowledge and thank my graduate students kirstin devries, frances mitilineos, jilana ordman, david roufs, and sonya seifert for engaging in thoughtful discussions on the topic with me throughout a year-long course.
the legal system was disconcerted by the rapid growth of the internet, particularly the implications of a buyer being able to access a seller's website from a different location.
this raised fundamental issues of jurisdiction and federalism for the courts.
moreover, the emergence of the ability to share and modify software and digital assets raised new debates about ownership and control.
around the mid-1990s, legal scholars started the cyberlaw movement to tackle these complex issues and others like them.
cyberlaw focuses on the unique features of the internet that differentiate it from previous technologies like computers and phones, leading to essential tensions that need to be addressed.
each aspect of the internet, either on its own or combined with others, plays a critical role in shaping various central conflicts in cyberlaw.
the open dissemination of information fosters innovative modes of collaborative content creation and governance, yet it also brings about or worsens issues related to intellectual property rights and privacy concerns.
the internet serves as a connective thread for communities but often sparks disputes along its seams.
it creates a distinctive virtual environment with new opportunities and standards, while simultaneously paving the way for meticulous regulation by both private entities and governmental bodies.
the subsequent section provides a non-comprehensive overview of internet-specific legal matters, covering topics such as jurisdiction, intermediary responsibilities, digital asset ownership, copyright, freedom of expression, and data privacy, among other complex legal dilemmas.
intermediaries analyze the personal data they collect while offering services, often motivated by financial gains to potentially misuse the information.
furthermore, concerning is the government's extensive reach into digital spheres and the increasing trend among public entities to share and exploit data to the detriment of individuals or specific groups.
this evolving discourse delves into issues of power imbalances, with a range of approaches being utilized, including behavioral economics, constitutional theory, and postmodern perspectives.
my fundamental assumption is that a system interacts with its surroundings by directly altering that environment.
providing information in an understandable manner does not qualify a technology as a robot since it lacks the capability to physically act.
a true robot, in the most robust sense, exists as a tangible entity in the physical world with the ability to exert itself physically.
however, i am discussing this concept on a spectrum.
it may be suitable to classify certain virtual entities designed to exist in and impact the world as robots, especially if they fulfill other defining criteria.
consider a scenario where a room projects an image of a person seemingly moving around the room.
the software controlling this persona has access to various sensors and speakers, along with significant processing capabilities, enabling it to engage with visitors.
furthermore, envision that this room can access a credit line and arrange for takeout food delivery.
the ability to cause physical impact on the world is not a new concept in legal terms.
early tort cases focused on the physical outcomes of actions involving objects.
the fact that drones or other robots can inflict harm from a distance is also not a significant factor.
for instance, a bullet fired from land where one has permission to be can encroach onto neighboring land without authorization.
while the scenario of a drone flying over a backyard below regulated airspace potentially violating property boundaries may serve as an intriguing illustration for clarifying property rights, it does not introduce a new legal concept.
in general, people find it easy to classify most things in the world without confusion.
we naturally understand that a brick wall cannot communicate with us or have thoughts like a person could.
however, robots present a unique challenge.
given their position between being an agent and an object, contemporary psychology struggles to categorize robotics.
it is unsurprising then, that legal systems dealing with criminal and tort law may face similar challenges.
broadly speaking, the law typically distinguishes between individuals and objects.
for example, if a barrel falls out of the window, we apply the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, attributing fault to the warehouse owner for potential safety negligence.
conversely, if a person jumps out of the window, we consider factors like whether their actions were within the scope of their employment.
in brief, innovative technologies often possess intrinsic characteristics that shape the legal and policy discussions surrounding them.
for example, the internet's core values of connectivity, community, and control triggered debates concerning how commercial, creative, and civic interactions occur online, especially considering the significant role of intermediaries.
while these debates remain relevant, they have somewhat receded from the forefront due to their familiarity and ongoing scholarly and policymaker interventions.
in contrast, emerging technologies, like robotics, introduce fresh challenges such as integrating data, managing unpredictability, and distinguishing between individuals and tools.
in line with these moderate stances, i also propose a balanced view of legal exceptionalism when evaluating robotics.
a technology should not be considered exceptional solely because it brings about minor legal changes or exposes gaps in current legal interpretations.
similarly, a technology does not have to completely disrupt the legal system or introduce entirely new doctrines to be deemed exceptional.
instead, a technology is exceptional when its integration into everyday use necessitates a comprehensive adjustment to existing laws or legal structures to maintain, or possibly alter, the current equilibrium of values.
while advocating for the segregation of robotics as a distinct field, it is prudent to leverage insights from lessig and other cyberlaw experts.
the concepts of code governance and the significance of analogies continue to hold considerable relevance within the realm of robotics.
how much influence the government or businesses exert over the design of robots will significantly impact academic and policy assessments.
moreover, understanding the interactions between code and law may provide valuable guidance in developing strategies to address potential erratic and harmful software behavior.
the inquiry into how software limits human actions can broaden to encompass how legal frameworks and coding principles can restrict robotic conduct.
a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between robotics and the legal system requires drawing from the interdisciplinary pragmatism that has developed within cyberlaw.
the unique characteristics of robotics intertwine computer and social science disciplines even more intricately than the internet.
effective discourse among legally and technically knowledgeable individuals is vital, whether it occurs at conferences, hearings, through papers, or in the drafting of legislation.
this dynamic is already evidenced by collaborations emerging in the regulation of driverless cars and drones.
for instance, events like the annual robotics law and policy conference we robot witness a significant attendance from both roboticists and lawyers.
having observed these collaborative efforts firsthand, it is evident that the agility and coherence of such initiatives are greatly indebted to the foundations laid by cyberlaw.
in briefly examining the fundamental characteristics of robotics, it becomes evident that this field warrants a distinct academic investigation separate from cyberlaw.
this differentiation is crucial as it highlights the unique traits of each technology and the novel human interactions they facilitate.
exploring robotics is poised to yield valuable legal perspectives that can complement the innovative legal frameworks established by the internet.
drawing from decades of cyberlaw research, valuable lessons can be applied to the study of any new technology, particularly one that shares similarities with robotics.
these include the significance of using analogies in making legal decisions pertaining to technology, the tendency of scholars and courts to adopt specific metaphors, the impact of design on regulations, and notably, the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration.
present-day societal challenges often require a comprehensive approach that transcends the confines of law or any single field of study.
we propose considering both the adverse and beneficial impacts of nonnative species.
it is argued that a more comprehensive classification of an invasive species would be based on whether it predominantly causes negative effects.
embracing a dynamic outlook on nature acknowledges that species traits and human perceptions evolve over time, reflecting continuous evolutionary changes and allowing for a more fair and impartial strategy when dealing with non-native species.
even though there are practical obstacles, we remain optimistic that engaging in informed conversations between policymakers and the public regarding data and the potential of machine learning will result in well-thought-out development of initiatives and policies.
these should strike a balance between safeguarding privacy and promoting fairness, while also capitalizing on the advantages for scientific research, as well as individual and public health.
our unwavering dedication to privacy and fairness is constant, yet our policy decisions need to evolve to enhance them and embrace novel methodologies to enhance our understanding.
machine learning as an academic field is an interdisciplinary junction blending principles from computer science, statistics, and various other realms focused on continuous enhancement, uncertain decision-making, and inference processes.
interlinked domains encompass the psychology of human learning, evolutionary studies, adaptive control theory, educational methodologies, neuroscience, organizational dynamics, and economics.
while recent years have witnessed heightened collaboration among these disciplines, there is a vast untapped reservoir of potential synergies, alongside a broad spectrum of formalisms and research techniques utilized across these diverse fields for analyzing systems that evolve with practice.
mobile devices and embedded computing technologies enable the collection of extensive data on individuals, allowing machine-learning algorithms to tailor services according to each person's requirements and situations.
furthermore, by interconnecting these personalized services, an integrated service can be created that capitalizes on the vast and varied data from numerous individuals while still maintaining customization for each user.
this trend of utilizing big data for enhancing services and productivity is prevalent in various sectors such as commerce, science, and government.
the analysis of past medical records helps identify the most effective treatments for individual patients; historical traffic data aids in enhancing traffic management and alleviating congestion; past crime data assists in strategically deploying local law enforcement resources; and extensive experimental data collections are collected and organized to expedite advancements in fields such as biology, astronomy, and neuroscience.
it seems that we are entering a prolonged period of transitioning towards more data-driven, evidence-based decision-making across various domains including science, business, and governance.
just like any powerful technology, machine learning raises important considerations about which of its potential applications society should promote or discourage.
the recent trend towards gathering new types of personal data, driven by its economic value, presents clear privacy concerns as discussed earlier.
additionally, the growing value of data gives rise to a second ethical dilemma: determining who will have access to and ownership of online data, as well as who will benefit from it.
currently, many corporations collect data for specific purposes to boost profits, often without a willingness to share that data.
nevertheless, unlocking the potential benefits society could gain, even from existing online data, would be significant if such information were made accessible for public good.
the augmented neo-classical model expands on the traditional production function by incorporating human capital as an additional input.
by considering human capital externalities at the economy-wide level, it acknowledges their role in enhancing output levels.
the endogenous growth perspective posits that human capital exerts a dynamic impact on output levels beyond its static effect.
it suggests that boosting human capital can lead to higher rates of innovation in economies, thereby influencing productivity growth.
extensive evidence demonstrates the presence of variations in the growth regression parameters among different countries.
this prompts inquiry into the extent to which these regressions inform us about average parameters and the reliability of extending results from a diverse sample to offer policy recommendations for individual countries.
specifically, it is highly questionable to utilize an estimate obtained from a heterogeneous group of countries to draw conclusions about the effects of educational advancements in the uk.
the conversation has likely indicated that attempting to standardize all estimates on a common basis would not be very practical, if feasible at all.
therefore, table 2 compares different studies by emphasizing the dependent variable analyzed, the schooling regressor employed, whether the study focused on measuring human capital flow or level, the reported estimated coefficient, and an explanation of the inferred impact.
the analysis encompasses both developed and developing countries, unless otherwise stated.
if available in the studies, the average of the human capital proxy is included.
the economic performance indicated by output per worker seems to have a strong connection with the underlying driver of growth—social infrastructure.
this is reflected by a combination of government anti-corruption policies and a positive attitude towards international trade.
likewise, a robust social infrastructure is linked to the factors that contribute to economic performance, such as enhancing the accumulation of physical and human capital, and positively impacting residual productivity.
despite being relatively new, some recent notable advancements have been made using a fresh unified dataset for the oecd.
these advancements incorporate advanced methodologies that leverage the longitudinal aspect of the data, resulting in substantial and reliable findings within models that demonstrate strong explanatory capability.

both regionally and globally, these conflicts significantly influence industrial competition.
this network of widely used mechanisms transforms previously public knowledge into proprietary information.
pre-innovation agreements on intellectual property frequently extend beyond tangible assets, encompassing futuristic innovations not yet realized.
non-disclosure agreements go beyond conventional trade secrets and are consistently upheld by the legal system.
the breach of confidentiality obligations is increasingly seen as a criminal offense, which inhibits beneficial exchanges aligned with professional standards.
non-compete clauses are now commonplace across various sectors, hindering job mobility and information dissemination.
besides individual contracts between employers and employees, recent antitrust probes targeting tech giants in silicon valley like apple, google, intel, ebay, and pixar highlight collusive agreements that limit recruitment and entrepreneurial activities.
the prevalence of post-employment restrictions creates a dense intellectual property landscape that hinders effective hiring strategies and innovation.
ownership has evolved over time to encompass not only future innovations but also efforts to reclaim previous knowledge a staff member possessed upon joining a company.
this evolution entails a surge in pre-innovation contracts with clauses that extend ip ownership rights back to the company during the post-employment period, along with new legal principles like the assignor estoppel doctrine, which prohibits former employees from disputing a patent's validity.
this doctrine significantly constrains the defenses available to ex-employees aiming to enter the same industry, essentially making them legal liabilities for the firms that hire them.
furthermore, in recent years, the prevalence of non-compete agreements has skyrocketed, transitioning from personalized controls to broader meta-controls like cognitive cartels, exemplified by the antitrust lawsuit against high-tech giants in silicon valley over their anti-poaching agreements.
examining recent empirical studies on the relationship between innovation and human capital, section ii reveals the negative consequences of the emerging cognitive property by introducing a fresh classification of knowledge types in connection with human capital flows: tacit, relational, networked, motivational, and disruptive.
each form of knowledge elucidates the adverse impacts of the newfound cognitive property.
this section delves into the repercussions of contemporary human capital legislation by drawing from modern economic research on endogenous growth, labor market exploration, and innovation networks.
it highlights how markets can thrive through continuous investment in collective cognitive capital.
in section iii, the argument is made that the surge in cognitive controls should be recognized as the third enclosure movement, transforming human capital and intangible intellectual assets—such as knowledge, expertise, skills, creativity, and networks—into property, ultimately affecting the public domain negatively.
the section elaborates on these developments in light of the shift from perceiving intellectual property through an antitrust perspective to a property perspective.
sergey alyenikov, a prominent programmer at goldman sachs, was arrested by the fbi a month after he resigned from the company to join teza technologies.
he was subsequently prosecuted and found guilty under the economic espionage act for unlawfully taking proprietary technology.
allegations from goldman indicated that alyenikov had taken computer code and emailed himself 32 megabytes of source code.
upon detecting the unauthorized downloads, goldman promptly alerted the fbi, leading to alyenikov's swift arrest.
as a result, he received an eight-year federal prison sentence.
from a business standpoint, many potential employers are reluctant to take the risk of potential legal action by hiring an individual who is already under a non-compete agreement.
for instance, in a recent incident, a previous employer notified a competitor, who had hired an employee from their company, about the existence of a non-compete agreement.
consequently, the new employer promptly terminated the employee.
subsequently, the individual took legal action against their former employer, claiming interference with their new job.
however, the court ruled in favor of the former employer, stating that sending warning letters about non-compete agreements is within their rights and that the consequences of the termination did not raise any legal concerns.
in the subsequent sections, these worries are elaborated on through the creation of an innovative classification system that delineates the various dimensions of knowledge present in present-day talent reservoirs.
examining the fundamental elements of human knowledge and the milestones of advancement and creativity is crucial to comprehending the implications of this new cognitive asset.
human capital encompasses a diverse array of knowledge types crucial to enhancing productivity, ranging from knowledge that cannot be easily articulated to knowledge demonstrated through skills, expertise, interpersonal connections, inventive thinking, drive, and the capacity to innovate and inspire change.
the individuals who were requested to agree to human capital restrictions for future employment in our online job platform exhibited lower task performance and were more inclined to quit the experiment prematurely.
these results indicate that participants subject to other post-employment constraints show less dedication to task completion compared to those who are unrestricted.
recent field data further validates these experimental results, indicating that companies invest less in research and human capital development when non-compete agreements are strictly enforced.
this provides additional proof that investment choices are influenced by employees themselves, who assess their own potential for transitioning to a different organization.
this discovery suggests that the emerging concept of cognitive property, which deprives employees of their human capital ownership, not only hinders mobility and knowledge sharing but also diminishes incentives for innovation.
for well-established large companies, preventing employees from participating in certain innovative initiatives helps reduce the risks of intellectual property lawsuits.
however, new employers aiming to adhere to legal rules and avoid potential consequences of using intellectual property may need to endure ineffective processes that involve restricting employees from engaging in activities where they excel.
conversely, smaller and newer firms find these segregations, which are inefficient for any company, unfeasible.
lacking the legal and financial capabilities, small companies can be forced out of the market by larger corporations, even if their legal arguments are weak.
litigation becomes strategic when it capitalizes on the uncertainty of claims, high litigation costs, and imbalanced stakes between the company and former employees.
ultimately, even in cases where claims lack evidence, small businesses can still be displaced from the market.
modern human capital law is described as a complex entity that has evolved discreetly over time.
this emergence of cognitive property rights has led to the inclusion of not just the outcomes of innovation but also the essential elements required for it, such as skills, experience, implicit knowledge, professional relationships, drive, and inventive capability, into private ownership.
the increasing importance of human capital as a valuable asset, coupled with significant shifts in labor markets, has resulted in a surge in disputes and conflicts.
the article contends that the proliferation of cognitive property encloses crucial knowledge and creativity, limiting their availability.
in the present day, human capital law poses a critical collective challenge.
regulations like non-compete agreements, non-disclosure clauses, trailer clauses, and pre-innovation terms hinder the free flow of knowledge in the market, reducing both the motivation for efficient market participation and innovation.
regrettably, many individuals modify their behaviors solely due to what is identified in sdt as controlled motivation.
external regulation is a prevalent type of controlled motivation where individuals act in order to receive an external reward, evade a punishment, or conform to societal pressures.
health professionals often encourage external regulation by proposing incentives, setting conditions, or relying on their position of authority for motivation.
another category of controlled motivation is introjection, where patients may behave in hopes of gaining approval, praise, avoiding disapproval, or alleviating feelings of guilt.
practitioners may foster introjection as a means to urge patients into action by offering conditional approval.
according to sdt, both forms of introjected controlled regulation are essential for long-term adherence to a particular behavior.
contrastingly, change can stem from autonomous motivation, characterized by identified regulation - when an individual personally connects with the value or significance of a behavior or health practice.
this connection is fostered when professionals convey relevant information and meaningful reasons for change without imposing external constraints that diminish a person's sense of control or choice.
a higher level of autonomy is seen in integrated regulation, where a person not only values a behavior but also harmonizes it with other fundamental values and lifestyle patterns.
practitioners support this integration by helping individuals navigate obstacles to change and identify consistent paths to better health.
as per sdt, both identified and integrated regulations are autonomous forms of motivation linked to better sustainability and application of behavioral changes.
during the 19th century, scientists uncovered the concept of the "greenhouse effect," recognizing that gases in the atmosphere play a role in regulating the earth's temperature.
initially, their focus was on the correlation between lower levels of carbon dioxide and ancient ice ages.
at the turn of the 20th century, svante arrhenius theorized that human industrial activities could lead to global warming from emissions.
however, this hypothesis was met with skepticism by many of his peers.
callendar proposed that the rise in carbon dioxide levels was associated with an increase in global temperatures, but this idea faced criticism from the scientific community.
it wasn't until the 1950s that a few researchers stumbled upon evidence that validated the possibility of global warming.
keeling's measurements confirmed a rapid increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, sparking increased scientific interest in understanding past fluctuations and the complex interplay of chemical and biological factors influencing such changes.
the heated air emits a portion of the energy back towards the surface, aiding in maintaining its warmth.
this phenomenon was later termed the "greenhouse effect," a misnomer.
the scientific tools accessible to researchers in the 19th century were insufficient for precise calculations.
nevertheless, basic physics demonstrated that a planet devoid of an atmosphere, situated at earth's distance from the sun, should be considerably colder than our planet earth.
despite the fact that some individuals were aware of the inaccuracy, there were numerous other prominent rationales for dismissing the existence of any greenhouse effect in the near future.
these rationales stemmed from a widely held belief in the earth's inherent ability to self-regulate through a "balance of nature." in a more detailed analysis, scientists consistently put forth the convincing argument that any surplus gases introduced into the atmosphere would be absorbed by the oceans.
it was noted that the amount of carbon dissolved in sea water was significantly higher – fifty times more – than that found in the delicate atmosphere.
consequently, the equilibrium concentration of co2 was believed to be controlled by the oceans, leading to the conclusion that it would remain relatively stable and not deviate significantly from current levels.
research is conducted at the forefront of unknowns.
callendar, like many discussed in these essays, relied on both intuition and logic to make sense of the vague information and theories available.
similar to his contemporaries, his arguments combined truths with inaccuracies, awaiting further clarification by future researchers.
although he couldn't definitively demonstrate the existence of global warming, he presented grounds for deliberation.
callendar's boldness played a significant role, reviving the concept of global warming and presenting it for consideration within the scientific realm.
not all disregarded his assertions; their ambiguity intrigued scientific interest.
successive teams extracted ice core samples for two decades, but each attempt to assess the levels proved inconsistent and inconclusive.
eventually, reliable techniques were established, involving meticulous cleaning of ice samples, their crushing in a vacuum, and prompt measurement of the extracted content.
notably, in 1980, a team disclosed definitive, surprising, and groundbreaking findings stemming from these refined processes.
the latest ice core findings indicate a robust feedback loop that intensified variations in sunlight.
a crucial discovery was that even a slight increase in temperature would lead to a slight uptick in greenhouse gas levels.
firstly, warmer oceans would release more gas through evaporation.
additionally, as the extensive arctic tundras warmed, the bogs would emit higher amounts of co2 and methane.
this increase in greenhouse gases would further elevate temperatures, prompting a subsequent release of more gases, thus initiating a cascading effect that gradually shifted the planet into a warmer phase.
over millennia, this process would reverse as solar radiation waned in key latitudes.
the bogs and oceans would then absorb greenhouse gases, ice would accumulate, and the earth would transition back into an ice age.
this revelation finally clarified how minor alterations in earth's orbit could dictate the timing of the dramatic fluctuations in glacial cycles.
tyndall's inquiries into the fundamental physics and chemistry issues had been effectively addressed.
detailed computations were available regarding the impact of co2 on radiation, its dissolution in seawater, and various other physical processes.
future advancements would primarily focus on comprehending the intricate interplay within the global ecosystem, with a particular emphasis on the relationships with organisms.
among these, humans held significant importance.
the climate conditions projected for a hundred years later would predominantly hinge on the decisions they made concerning their emissions.
one instance of a private regulatory entity that maintains less affiliation with state or inter-state involvement is the world anti-doping agency, affiliated with the international olympic committee.
this agency meticulously adheres to due process standards when addressing athletes suspected of using banned substances, ultimately resorting to the private international court of arbitration for sport for review.
while challenges present themselves in extending administrative law principles to such organizations, these obstacles are contingent on specific contexts rather than universal.
examining these entities as components of global administration and discerning parallels and distinctions in accountability mechanisms crafted for public and private entities is deemed beneficial.
this concise overview of structures and examples illustrates that crucial regulatory functions are now not solely confined to domestic boundaries but have evolved to have a significant transnational or global influence.
this shift is particularly evident in the realm of rulemaking, where genuinely international efforts intersect with actions taken by national regulators within networks of global cooperation.
these collaborations serve to complement and often shape domestic initiatives, thereby deeply impacting domestic regulatory frameworks and choices.
furthermore, there is a growing trend where global determinations directly impact individuals or businesses, as seen in scenarios such as united nations security council rulings on sanctions and counterterrorism measures, unhcr operations, the clean development mechanism within the kyoto protocol, as well as the routine integration of financial action task force decisions into domestic legislation.
nevertheless, the integration of the two spheres is already extensive in various regulatory and administrative domains.
the emergence of global regulatory initiatives and their incorporation into domestic frameworks imply that decisions made by domestic administrators are increasingly bound by global-level norms, eroding the traditional autonomy of domestic entities from the international sphere.
simultaneously, some global administrative entities exercising these decisions exhibit significant de facto autonomy and discretion, dispelling the notion that they merely act as agents of states.
evaluating the implications and development of this interconnectedness requires nuanced analysis, with varying perspectives on its significance.
from our vantage point, international jurists can no longer feasibly claim that global administrative governance is devoid of democracy or legitimacy shortcomings, given that global regulatory bodies are accountable to states, and these states, in turn, are answerable to their electorates and judicial systems.
when considering a perspective based on practice rather than natural law, there is still a lack of clarity on how to establish the norms and legal standing.
the extensive agreement needed among legal systems for general principles of law highlights a dedication to inclusivity and avoiding dominance by specific state groups.
despite its appeal in global administrative law, the concept of ius gentium will also need to tackle this issue.
one final issue concerning sources pertains to the role of domestic law.
domestic law holds significant authority in overseeing domestic administration and consequently influencing national administrative agencies that either enforce global laws or participate in global administrative frameworks, or both.
furthermore, domestic courts can serve as a platform for seeking recourse in situations where global administrative bodies directly impact private entities.
this underscores the importance of domestic law in upholding accountability in global administration practices; and a nuanced framework of accountability rooted in domestic processes could serve as a way to acknowledge the diverse normative values of each nation and accommodate variations.
nonetheless, domestic procedures shaped by local preferences may not always align with the necessity for a level of global uniformity in principles and mechanisms, as well as the need to adapt to the specifics of certain global administrative structures.
conflicts between domestic law, especially constitutional law, and these global requirements may pose challenges in finding resolutions, potentially necessitating short-term pragmatic solutions.
while potentially pinpointing the origins of global administrative law could be agreed upon, whether through traditional international law or a renewed ius gentium perspective, the development of a precise and comprehensive set of regulations and principles governing global administration seems improbable at the moment, even within official intergovernmental frameworks.
existing written intergovernmental agreements concerning these standards are scattered and scarce, global administrative bodies operate with fragmented practices, and formal domestic regulations widely differ, despite some trend towards convergence.
moreover, hybrid and private global regulatory systems are not directly bound by many of these regulations, and the aligning administrative principles and practices with these hybrid and private systems remain ambiguous.
additionally, following an ius gentium standpoint, dissension is expected regarding whose practices are considered influential for rule formation and the extent of consistent practices required to establish firm support for compliance.
in a traditional context, national courts have examined rulings made by global private administrative entities.
they adhere to the regulations of private international law, which encompass provisions concerning local public policy.
consequently, national courts are generally inclined to assume jurisdiction.
for instance, the ioc's international sports system and its associated international court of arbitration for sport have had to persuade national courts that their determinations regarding anti-doping issues comply with due process requirements to gain recognition under local legislation.
it is not only the courts that play a role in enhancing the accountability of global administration in domestic settings.
in the united states, for instance, certain federal regulatory authorities engage in international standard-setting and provide notice and comment.
this allows interested individuals to participate in administrative processes during a preparatory phase, ensuring their input can influence international negotiations that may impact domestic regulatory laws.
similarly, some parliaments are expanding their oversight to include the involvement of national officials in global administrative networks.
for instance, the u.s. congress mandates reports from regulatory agencies before endorsing recommendations from financial regulatory bodies like the basle committee.
however, these efforts are currently sporadic and disjointed, often arising from specific issues and leaving some problems unaddressed while extensively focusing on others.
global administrative law not only encompasses a variety of institutional mechanisms but also includes fundamental legal principles and requirements that are both procedural and substantive in nature.
due to the fragmented nature of global administrative practices and the lack of comprehensive knowledge surrounding it, making definitive claims about the doctrinal elements governing this field in its entirety is not possible at this point.
however, some potential elements can be tentatively identified, though their current applicability may be limited.
future research will play a crucial role in determining the extent to which these elements, along with others, are reflected in global administrative practices and their potential application or adaptation to areas of international or transnational regulation where administrative law is currently underdeveloped or nonexistent.
participation in international administrative processes is not limited to individuals or states directly impacted by decisions.
in the realm of establishing standards and regulations, various organizations, like the codex alimentarius commission, have made efforts to involve non-governmental organizations that represent affected social and economic interests.
additionally, national regulatory bodies now also inform the public about proposed standards under discussion in global discussions they are engaged in.
despite these advancements, opportunities for participation in rulemaking have been limited to certain specific instances and sectors.
the extent to which a right of review is acknowledged in various governance domains, along with the accompanying limitations and institutional mechanisms involved, remains a topic of unresolved inquiry.
despite widespread demands for robust review procedures in critical sectors, their implementation has been lacking.
for instance, the security council's failure to establish an impartial body to assess its sanctions rulings is a notable example.
similarly, the unhcr has thus far restricted itself to internal oversight mechanisms.
even in transitional administrations of regions like bosnia, kosovo, or east timor, international bodies have been hesitant to grant individuals the right to seek review of intergovernmental agency actions through formal judicial processes or by external bodies with greater authority than ombudspersons.
the english school of international relations introduces three distinct patterns of international ordering: pluralism, solidarism, and cosmopolitanism.
inter-state pluralism reflects the conventional international law model, where treaties, international institutions, and administration are confined to areas of mutual agreement among states.
this approach doesn't typically resolve major value conflicts, and states usually retain implementation powers without centralization.
inter-state solidarism suggests enhancing the authority of international institutions and global administration based on shared values.
while cooperation remains rooted in interstate negotiations, states are obligated to support the global administration system and its decisions, even if they clash with immediate self-interests.
on the other hand, cosmopolitanism envisions global governance not only arising from inter-state negotiations but also integrating civil society networks, private regulators, media bodies, and markets.
these three patterns serve as simplified ideal categories.
generally, in various issue areas, one model tends to be perceived by participants as dominant and influential.
for instance, arms control and disarmament typically operate under a pluralist framework, the international criminal court is commonly viewed as a solidarist endeavor, and the management of global sports matters is largely seen as cosmopolitan in nature.
these organizational structures within the international sphere are more reflections of the perceptions of the participants rather than objective realities.
their attitudes and behaviors are guided by their interpretations of the prevailing dynamics.
the second normative perspective in administrative law is centered on liberalism and rights protection.
it emphasizes safeguarding the rights of individuals and other members of civil society by enabling their involvement in administrative processes and by offering avenues for legal review to confirm the legitimacy of decisions.
this approach can also encompass the safeguarding of state rights.
the third perspective highlights the role of global administrative law in fostering democracy.
many national administrative laws incorporate a democratic element by ensuring that administrators are accountable to parliament and by guaranteeing their adherence to laws, as well as involving the broader public in administrative decision-making procedures.
these three viewpoints are presented here as a broad overview in the ongoing discourse.
a comprehensive examination of normative considerations would necessitate a more detailed exploration of a wide array of intricate and varied perspectives that may not neatly align with these basic prototypes.
the initial concept of global administrative law is considered the least demanding in terms of norms among the three perspectives.
it assumes an existing order and focuses on ensuring that all elements and actors within this system fulfill their designated roles and adhere to the internal regulations of the regime.
in this context, the rationale behind administrative law is primarily functional: it serves as a tool to maintain and safeguard the unity and effective operation of an institutional framework that has its own independent justification.
the functionality of any worldwide administrative system heavily relies on the coordinated efforts of various components and actors, whether they are international, transnational, or domestic.
as a result, it necessitates the establishment of mechanisms to ensure that each entity carries out its designated roles in alignment with the regulatory standards of the system.
typically, these mechanisms involve monitoring the boundaries of authorization and verifying adherence to the regulations laid down by the governing body.
for instance, the world bank inspection panel can be interpreted as a tool through which the board supervises the management, and in turn, the central administration oversees operational managers.
similarly, the wto dispute settlement body serves as a mechanism to maintain and enforce the regulations of the global system on dispersed domestic administrations.
likewise, the introduction of european regulations regarding member-state administrative processes, which include provisions for participation in and legal review of administrative decisions made by member states, has facilitated the more effective imposition and enforcement of european legislation on resistant domestic regulators.
this aspect of global administration to some degree parallels domestic oversight mechanisms like those implemented in the u.s. the second category of normative objectives in global administrative law, which is focused on safeguarding rights, is more assertive in its normative assumptions.
this aspect is adaptable to various interpretations of international order, especially when rights are broadly defined.
in all perspectives of administrative law, the rights being discussed typically belong to those directly subject to regulation, such as states, individuals, businesses, or at times, non-governmental organizations.
similar to domestic administrative law, there is also a consideration for third-party rights that may belong to individuals or groups who are indirectly impacted by regulatory choices.
advocates highlight the role of domestic administrative law in upholding democracy by ensuring that administrative actions comply with parliamentary laws and facilitate transparency and the involvement of the public in the rulemaking process.
the specifics of how these goals are achieved can differ based on the legal framework in place.
for example, u.s. administrative law focuses on courts enforcing agencies' obligations to thoroughly consider the social and economic impacts of their decisions.
agencies must also provide well-founded justifications for their policy choices, taking into account feedback from stakeholders expressed through public participation channels.
while this model of judicial oversight of public engagement is prevalent in the u.s., it is not as widely adopted in various other national systems.
democratic systems across different nations employ diverse methods to implement democratic oversight and manage the necessary discretion for effective administration.
these mechanisms range from parliamentary and executive controls to centralized systems with cost-benefit analysis, expert input, administrative law procedures, and judicial review.
the foundation of the domestic model of administrative law lies in a specific institutional framework centered around a core democratic legislative body and the laws it enacts.
while some advocate for a comparable global democratic system, it is commonly seen as impractical or risky.
unlike domestic administrative law, the global level lacks independent judicial review mechanisms.
consequently, the development of global administrative law would necessitate a different approach: either by democratizing international lawmaking to enhance democratic oversight of administrative actions, or by establishing administrative processes capable of bearing the democratic responsibility independently.
however, both approaches currently face a challenge due to the absence of persuasive democratic theories tailored for the global context.
however, a perspective advocating for the advancement of global administrative law to promote democracy may not necessarily rely on a comprehensive democratic framework at the global level.
anne-marie slaughter has proposed a solution to the challenges of democratic accountability by suggesting that global administration could function effectively through government networks.
in this model, national officials participating in these networks would be accountable to their respective publics through their own domestic institutions.
slaughter asserts that ensuring domestic public accountability is more achievable within networks than within formal international organizations established through treaties, which tend to have greater operational independence.
upholding this accountability requires reinforcing domestic mechanisms, such as expanding and refining domestic administrative law structures to regulate the involvement of national officials in global administrative decision-making processes.
while this approach could enhance a particular form of democratic legitimacy, its effectiveness may be constrained by the practical dynamics of decision-making within intergovernmental networks.
moreover, as global governance involves various significant institutions besides intergovernmental networks, relying solely on this approach would offer merely a partial resolution.
lastly, although this strategy aligns well with a pluralist model of global organization by linking responsibility for worldwide decision-making to the distinct legal and political bodies of each involved country, it could hinder the advancement of solidarist or cosmopolitan visions of international governance for similar reasons.
therefore, it could be suggested that global administrative law take a more practical and less ambitious approach.
given the current circumstances, it may be acknowledged that there is no fully democratic foundation for global administration.
however, global administrative structures are essential to address issues that national democracies cannot resolve independently.
in this imperfect scenario, a pragmatic global administrative law could strive to enhance the involvement of affected social and economic interests.
this could be achieved by fostering participation and oversight mechanisms that are accessible to non-governmental organizations, businesses, civil society groups, as well as states and international bodies.
nevertheless, this approach falls short of ensuring public representation comparable to local electoral systems, and thus cannot entirely validate the exercise of administrative power based on democratic principles.
at each stage, the development of global administrative law with democratic aspirations would need to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of broad participation, thus incorporating practical insights into the progressive advancement of public accountability.
this situation brings to mind the age-old and complex discussions between reformers and revolutionaries, acknowledging that both perspectives hold valid points.
it also underscores the importance of considering issues related to fair distribution and enhancing the accountability of global governance to marginalized groups.
many current proposals aim to enhance accountability primarily towards the populations in the northern hemisphere, market players, social concerns, and governments.
however, prioritizing the ability of these entities to enforce accountability on global governance could widen existing global disparities and weaken institutions that are critical for supporting disadvantaged communities.
to tackle accountability challenges effectively, global administrative law may need to develop strategies to empower and involve individuals and their representatives from the global south.
thus, prioritizing the enhanced participation of developing nations in global administrative frameworks could be more pressing than introducing further avenues of influence for wealthier regions.
nevertheless, this concept is not universally applicable.
the identification of suitable global decision-making frameworks for the establishment of participatory rights and determining the scope of reviewable actions in the absence of binding agreements can often be ambiguous.
implementing a comprehensive system of mandatory, top-down governance at the global scale is not a feasible solution in the foreseeable future, as it would necessitate granting global institutions a level of authority beyond current practicality.
by contrast, in a decentralized system of governance, these issues are mitigated as global administrative law standards can be enforced upon established national regulatory bodies.
global governance often involves collaboration between domestic regulatory bodies, which can play a vital role in its effectiveness alongside domestic implementation efforts.
this bottom-up approach has the potential to enhance accountability and bridge global governance with democratic processes.
however, this strategy encounters significant challenges, particularly in applying it to formal international organizations, hybrid governance structures, or private governance systems.
implementing this approach for global decision-making within intergovernmental networks may be more feasible than for other types of administrative bodies.
moreover, harmonizing the diverse approaches adopted by different countries to influence global governance could present a significant hurdle.
additionally, critics argue that powerful nations wield undue influence over global governance compared to weaker states, posing a barrier to the successful implementation of the bottom-up approach.
individuals wishing to put the approach into practice will need to address the issue of the appropriate constituency: to whom should global administration answer—what public or publics?
if the relevant public is global or transboundary in nature and distinct from the combined national publics, conventional domestic methods may fall short.
the same challenge might apply to implementing domestic administrative regulations on a global scale: additional mechanisms may be needed to encompass a wider range of interests beyond the national public.
ruth grant and robert keohane highlight the inadequate checks and balances in global governance, the non-delegated power of key actors, and the absence of a well-defined global public.
their analysis prompts the consideration of developing alternative accountability mechanisms that extend beyond conventional domestic administrative law.
these mechanisms would encompass various forms of hierarchical, supervisory, and legal accountability, bolstered by market forces, peer pressure, financial regulations, and public perceptions.
such a shift would not only widen the scope of covered entities but also enable the application of these mechanisms to private actors like ngos or corporations, as well as to states, the primary power players in global relations.
this concept is not limited to just public entities but can also encompass various private organizations involved in global governance.
an additional proposed model involves mutual challenge and reinforcement, where different tiers of participation and oversight maintain an ambiguous relationship, enabling each to question others based on their respective normative principles and standards.
instances could involve national courts challenging international bodies like the un security council, or disputes over domestic administrative procedures with entities like the wto appellate body.
this dynamic process could result in advancing and adjusting accountability mechanisms across different levels of global governance.
while considered a transitional approach, it could evolve into a lasting element of the global administrative framework, characterized by ongoing debates and discrepancies surrounding legitimacy and justice.
to explore these inquiries, researchers at the nyu research project on global administrative law and similar endeavors are examining a diverse array of instances where administrative law or similar mechanisms, rules, and procedures akin to administrative law are utilized to enhance transparency, engagement, and answerability in informal, cooperative, and hybrid frameworks along with in multi-level systems with shared decision-making responsibilities.
articulating the concept of global administrative law could facilitate linking various specialized areas of theory and practice, thus uncovering similarities and inconsistencies that may have gone unnoticed before.
by delving into a broad range of case studies focusing on specific domains, alongside endeavors to create comparative and integrated conceptual frameworks and normative theories, it becomes possible to delve deeper into questions surrounding the formulation and necessity of mechanisms promoting transparency, engagement, scrutiny, and legality in global governance.
furthermore, conducting a more thorough examination of doctrinal characteristics and disparities paves the way for developing and testing hypotheses derived from positive political theory.
engaging with normative issues has the potential to enhance both transnational and global democratic theory, while also prompting critical examinations of how these principles can be practically applied to distinct administrative systems and the broader realm of global administrative law.
exploring normative questions will further advance practical interpretations regarding the significance of diversity, equality, and equity within global administrative law.
the imperative for alternative frameworks beyond prevailing global governance and administrative law models is urgent, yet the discourse on this topic is still nascent.
the roberts court has issued two significant tax-related rulings that empower tax law with remarkable legal authority to surpass constitutional restrictions.
by these decisions, the justices have indicated a strong stance to lawmakers, allowing them to leverage tax legislation as a tool to actively pursue public goals beyond its conventional revenue collection role.
moreover, the court emphasizes its commitment to endorsing initiatives executed through tax laws, even if those initiatives would be deemed unconstitutional if implemented through direct regulation or traditional government spending methods.
the recent developments in tax law pose significant challenges not only to the tax system but also to constitutional principles.
these cases highlight a deepening divide between economic and legal perspectives on taxation, creating a rift in how tax law is approached.
by reclassifying tax expenditures as private spending rather than state action, the court has effectively removed them from constitutional scrutiny, eroding the protections afforded to individuals.
this shift not only hampers tax reform initiatives and fiscal accountability but also undermines established legal principles and hinders transparent and fair governance.
the acs case provides a motivation for congress and state legislatures to introduce tax credits for activities that could be deemed unconstitutional under the bill of rights.
by structuring tax incentives to favor religious practices, lawmakers can essentially shield them from judicial scrutiny.
many tax articles mainly delve into the economic aspects without adequately considering the legal complexities inherent in tax laws.
however, this particular article stands out by addressing the inherent conflict between economic principles and legal reasoning within taxation.
it delves into why legal outcomes do not always align with economic realities.
this conflict is exemplified by the contrasting opinions in the two cases scrutinized in the article, where justices who supported the majority decision in one case dissented in the other.
in the nfib case, the article highlights how economic equivalence triumphed, leading the majority to uphold a mandate using the taxing power, despite its legal distinctions from a potentially equivalent taxing scheme.
before the american constitutional society (acs) decision, the handling of tax expenditures was subtle: while economic equivalence didn't always align with legal equivalence, it still held importance.
it was seen as an indication of government backing, a factor that influenced legal ramifications.
however, following the acs ruling, tax benefits for religious entities via a credit are now shielded from legal challenges.
this protection stands even when similar provisions would typically face judicial scrutiny and possibly be deemed unconstitutional.
the recent acs decision regarding tax has resulted in a scenario where tax expenditures are shielded similar to direct spending equivalents, essentially giving tax expenditures a constitutional status and protecting them from judicial scrutiny.
this decision could empower legislatures to potentially infringe upon the bill of rights without repercussions, as they can argue they are reducing taxes.
with tax expenditures now being on par with tax cuts legally, legislatures may be inclined to expand the number of programs administered through tax laws, all the while promoting their benevolence by enacting tax cuts that are politically favorable.
during the analysis of the establishment clause, it is highlighted that the government's message of endorsing religion carries more weight than the aspect of providing economic support.
therefore, the intended purposes outlined in the statute may hold more significance than the economic implications of its execution.
additionally, it is noted that financial assistance based on taxes is often less intertwined with religion compared to direct aid, thereby helping to sidestep issues related to the establishment clause.
assessing the acs case through this substantive criterion, it favors the state due to specific reasons.
the statute maintains neutrality between religious and non-religious schools without any references to religious entities within the law.
moreover, the involvement of stos acts as a buffer between the state and religious institutions, ensuring that funds do not flow directly from state funds to these organizations.
these distinctions play a crucial role in the constitutional assessment concerning establishment clause claims.
hence, the majority in the acs case did not find it necessary to label tax expenditures as tax reductions or personal spending to validate the sto credit.
consequently, had the supreme court addressed the matter, the plaintiffs would likely have been unsuccessful based on the substance of the case, despite the financial equality aspect.
the argument about revenue generated from growth applies specifically to business credits and not personal credits like the one involved in acs.
this is because for the tax reduction to be effective, it should lead to economic growth resulting in higher taxable income.
the majority in acs referenced a previous ruling related to business tax credits to support this claim, despite the earlier case not entirely aligning with the economic stance taken in the recent decision.
surprisingly, the supreme court took a controversial stance on the economic impact of tax credits, even though there was no discussion in acs about whether the sto credits yielded revenues to offset their costs.
instead, the court argued that plaintiffs could be harmed because stos, supporting private schools, undermine public education, and that funding private education lessens public expenditures by reducing the need to educate children in public schools.
the purpose of the tax expenditure budget aims to bring clarity to the concepts within tax laws.
by categorizing certain statutory provisions as integral to the tax system and others as ancillary, it distinguishes between elements crucial for income measurement, such as business expense deductions, and those that incentivize and subsidize specific activities.
while the tax system could function for revenue collection without tax expenditures, their removal would eliminate the ability to encourage and support certain behaviors, a key role of the federal tax system.
the federal income tax, though imperfect, functions with a degree of consistency due to established rules.
the majority opinion in the acs case fails to grasp the fundamental difference between tax reduction and spending within tax laws.
tax reductions alleviate individual burdens, whereas tax spending directs government resources toward specific goals.
three key factors help determine if a decrease in tax obligations constitutes a genuine tax reduction.
first, the focus should be on adjusting taxes for individuals rather than specific activities or investments to qualify as a tax cut.
second, the level of specificity in a tax provision can blur the line between tax cuts and government spending.
and third, tax cuts typically result in a decrease in government scope, while spending embedded in tax laws tends to expand it.
despite not meeting the criteria for a tax cut based on these factors, the court still interprets the acs provision as a tax cut.
a paradigmatic tax cut involves reducing tax rates, a move that is widely accepted as not equivalent to government spending.
lowering rates lightens the tax load without modifying what is subject to taxation.
decreases in rates maintain the parity among various funding sources and do not promote specific activities but rather spread tax responsibilities across diverse segments of society.
conversely, targeted tax incentives serve to change the appeal of specific funding sources, encourage certain behaviors, and adjust tax obligations within income brackets.
similarly, abolishing an entire tax system, like a state sales tax or the federal estate tax, qualifies as a tax cut.
in these instances, the tax burden is eradicated without changing the underlying basis on which the tax system relies.
budgeting is a challenging aspect of political governance, and legislative bodies often face difficult decisions and trade-offs.
many states are mandated by their constitutions to maintain balanced budgets.
it is common for individual taxpayers to not fully understand the intricate relationships between different spending priorities and how specific choices can impact other public objectives.
allowing taxpayers to allocate government funds in small increments can weaken overall fiscal discipline and disproportionately support a select few programs.
tax credits may deplete public funds without legislators thoroughly evaluating and prioritizing funding decisions, a fundamental duty of a representative government.
the acs ruling is criticized for enabling irresponsible legislative practices by legitimizing simplistic budgeting tactics.
the acs ruling could pose a significant challenge to revenue collection by potentially shrinking the tax base.
treating tax benefits as exemptions from tax review might worsen an existing bias in evaluating tax laws, which could harm government revenue.
the current imbalance in reviewing tax laws is compounded by standing rules that mainly apply to taxpayer lawsuits.
governments implement taxes through a system that includes both provisions for raising revenue and provisions for reducing it.
challenges are regularly brought against revenue-raising provisions.
tax expenditures, which are targeted reductions benefitting some without clear losers, are also contentious.
these targeted tax benefits typically disadvantage the general public and the government's finances.
taxpayers can sue to lessen their tax liability if they feel overtaxed, and their success in these suits can vary.
it could be argued that natural law judges operating within the common law system have praised international law not only by acknowledging its status as law but also by regarding it as fundamental to their interpretation of the rule of law or legality.
this implies that adherence to international law is essential for public officials to uphold the rule of law.
therefore, it becomes essential for international organizations responsible for making decisions impacting individuals under their legal purview to reciprocate this acknowledgment.
such organizations are advised to establish mechanisms ensuring that their officials adhere to the array of rule-of-law regulations.
consequently, domestic courts should approach judgments from international bodies with caution, questioning their validity if they do not align with these regulations.
furthermore, a third argument challenges a refined form of legal positivism that aims to acknowledge judicial decisions as a foundation of positive law: the evolution of a common law system of judicial review by judges over time is viewed as the fundamental legal basis for their grasp of the rule of law.
it is posited that advocates of the common-law constitution view judicial decisions as proof of the rule of law necessities rather than their origin.
the executive must operate within the bounds of its legal authority, as defined by the enabling statute.
judges ensure compliance by overseeing these boundaries.
judicial review, known as the doctrine of ultra vires, dictates that restrictions on executive discretion in executing a statutory mandate are confined to those set by the statute or by another authoritative source such as a law laying down general regulations for all administrative entities or a written constitution.
this discussion suggests that while officials should consider policy and political factors, they must also acknowledge the humanity of those affected by decisions and how these decisions impact them.
essentially, viewing individuals as holders of human rights emphasizes that anyone under official authority should be treated with dignity as a fellow human being.
consequently, it is not unexpected that the evolving international human rights discourse is applied to further define the principles of humanitarianism.
the inability to stretch the device so far, as asserted by the dissenters in teoh and baker, may be viewed as a hint that judges have reached the limits of their authority in reviews.
however, a more accurate interpretation is that one of the benefits of judicial infusion of international human rights law is to expose the inadequacy of the ultra vires doctrine as a basis for judicial review.
this integration by the judiciary illustrates that the original rationale was not rooted in a concept of legislative consent based on the separation of powers, but rather in upholding legality.
this approach holds both the legislature and the executive equally responsible to the constitutional principles.
in essence, resolving the dualism between international standards can help steer us away from the internal dualism perpetuated by legal formalist explanations of the judicial function in maintaining the rule of law.
shortly after the adoption of resolution 1373 by the security council, the governor in council enacted the united nations suppression of terrorism regulations.
these specific regulations are designed to disrupt the financial resources of terrorists by forbidding any financial transactions with specified entities and criminalizing the act of supplying or gathering funds for individuals on the list.
additionally, they mandate that canadian financial institutions, residents of canada, and all other canadian individuals must report any assets they suspect are possessed or controlled by a listed individual, along with details of transactions connected to these assets.
to sidestep the legal battle, the canadian government opted to revise the terrorism regulations to exclude hussein instead.
after consulting with u.s. authorities, canadian officials determined that hussein lacked ties to any terrorist actions and should not be included on the list.
while this move led to canada violating its security council duties and exposed hussein to potential sanctions from other countries, it successfully removed him from the security council roster, ensuring canada's adherence to international regulations.
the common law of judicial review places a significant emphasis on the concepts of legality and legitimacy, as public acts of authority must adhere to these values and principles to be considered lawful.
it is essential to note that the scope of public power extends beyond executive actions authorized by statutes, encompassing the legislature in legal systems without a formal constitution.
when a domestic court declines to recognize an extradition order linked to the 1267 committee's listing mechanism for rule-of-law reasons, it signifies a breach of legality that the security council must address to gain respect for its legislation.
moreover, if such listing is deemed unlawful, individuals affected by it could potentially seek compensation from the entities involved in the process.
it is not asserted that international law can be best interpreted as a kantian order of right.
rather, when it comes to the rule of law, the rationale behind the need for a division of powers is deemed more crucial than the specific distribution of powers.
in other words, breaches of the rule of law should be assessed by considering the fundamental values intended to be safeguarded by the division of powers rather than simply whether a particular power structure within a legal system has been disrupted.
individuals who could initiate reform face the challenge of deciding whether they prioritize upholding the rule of law.
if no solution can be found, it indicates a breakdown of the rule of law.
those responsible for initiating remedial reform should prioritize the fundamental values of the rule of law when establishing institutions to enable legal authorities to apply their power in alignment with these values.
as highlighted by the u.s. supreme court in rasul and hamdi, there needs to be a governmental body with oversight that allows individuals impacted by public decisions to have their grievances heard in a fair and just manner.
from one perspective, the international legal system can be regarded as having achieved a level of moral advancement that surpasses that of domestic legal systems, which may appear less developed in comparison.
specifically, i am referring to the evolution of international human rights law, which, alongside longstanding conventions such as the geneva convention, often serves as the primary framework for morally critiquing the actions of nation-states, whether for their failure to adhere to these standards or for falling short of their obligations.
nonetheless, just as it is deemed appropriate to censure countries for not aligning with or violating the principles of the moral community that upholds human rights, international organizations should also be subject to scrutiny if they establish norms without establishing the institutional mechanisms that more sophisticated domestic systems inherently possess.
within the realm of international human rights law, the fundamental issue may revolve around how to ensure the full participation of all nations in the normative moral framework.
in legal systems following common law traditions, the increasing control of prerogative powers by both legislation and common law can be seen as a reflection of optimism in legal practice.
similarly, recognizing international law as equally valid as domestic law and aiming to reconcile the norms of both to form a cohesive unity represents a significant advancement from the chaos of the state of nature.
despite this progress, kelsen’s failure lies in his rejection of the idea of enlightenment as a two-way process.
according to kelsen, international law is seen as the primary system, and domestic law must always align with its norms, excluding any consideration of natural laws or the moral principles underlying the rule of law.
in part i, it was evident that international bodies, similar to their domestic counterparts, can establish norms that may conflict with the rule of law.
i did not claim that judges always have the ability to resolve such conflicts or that they are the best positioned to devise solutions.
instead, i contended that what is crucial is a dedication to developing solutions and that a broader interpretation of the rule of law than that presented by legal positivism is necessary.
furthermore, as discussed in part ii, this more comprehensive view of the rule of law endorses the notion of international law and order but necessitates the maturation of the international legal system institutionally.
in the context of my examination of the 1267 committee, this requirement entails creating suitable due process standards before designating any individual as a suspected terrorist.
advancing knowledge in this cross-disciplinary area is enabling the creation of increasingly advanced second-generation technologies that incorporate bioresponsive components, specific ligands, and complex three-dimensional structures.
there is genuine optimism that, once perfected, these biomimetic nanostructures will offer enhanced therapies urgently needed for severe and disabling illnesses.
microbial infection remains a significant concern across various sectors, including medical devices, drugs, healthcare, water purification systems, textiles, and food handling.
antimicrobials have captured the attention of researchers and industry professionals due to their potential to enhance the quality and safety of diverse materials.
however, traditional low molecular weight antimicrobial agents pose challenges like environmental toxicity and limited effectiveness.
to address these issues, incorporating antimicrobial functional groups into polymer molecules has emerged as a promising solution.
antimicrobial polymers hold the potential to improve the effectiveness and longevity of existing antimicrobial agents while reducing environmental risks associated with their use.
the development of antimicrobial polymers presents a notable challenge for both the academic and industrial communities.
the potential of antimicrobial polymers lies in their ability to bolster the effectiveness of existing antimicrobial agents while addressing environmental concerns associated with traditional agents.
this is achieved by reducing residual toxicity, enhancing efficiency and selectivity, and extending the lifespan of the agents.
notably, polymeric antimicrobial agents possess advantages such as being nonvolatile, chemically stable, and non-permeable through the skin.
consequently, they can curtail losses linked to volatilization, photolytic decomposition, and transportation.
in the realm of biomedical polymers, infections related to biomaterials present a significant hurdle to the broader use of medical implants.
in modern medicine, infection stands as a primary cause of biomaterial implant failure.
through their role in decreasing the incidence of such failures, antimicrobial polymers are crucial.
for instance, catheters crafted from polymers that gradually release antibiotics could be a lifeline for numerous hospital patients vulnerable to infections annually.
furthermore, antimicrobial polymers show promise in combatting infections around more permanent implants like pacemakers.
an alternative technique involves imparting a biocidal function to the polymer post-processing.
to create polymers with antimicrobial properties, one can utilize polymerizable monomers containing biocide groups, which are then polymerized or copolymerized with additional monomers.
additionally, grafting antimicrobial agents onto naturally occurring or synthetic polymers presents another strategy for developing bioactive materials applicable across a range of uses.
this review focuses on recent advancements within the realm of antimicrobial polymers in the past decade, building upon earlier work by worley and sun.
it is structured to explore fundamental prerequisites, factors influencing the antimicrobial efficacy of polymers, and diverse methods and key applications of antimicrobial polymers.
observed that the antimicrobial efficacy of the quaternary ammonium dendrimers they synthesized was influenced by the type of counterion present.
specifically, they noted that biocides containing bromide anions exhibited greater potency compared to those with chloride anions.
in contrast, panarin and colleagues conducted research on homopolymers of vinylamine and methyl methacrylate with attached quaternary ammonium groups and found that the antibacterial properties were unaffected by the counter anions, whether chloride, bromide, or iodide.
the precise reason for the varying impact of counterions on antimicrobial activity remains unclear, except in cases where they may modify the solubility of the respective polymers.
the shake-flask method was employed to investigate the antibacterial properties of the monomer mq against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
this method is widely utilized for assessing the biocidal efficacy of substances.
the findings revealed that mq exhibited antibacterial effects after a 24-hour exposure.
the antimicrobial capability of the polymer pq, which was produced through the polymerization of mq, was also assessed, demonstrating its effectiveness as a potent antimicrobial compound.
furthermore, the polymer has the potential to serve as a drug delivery system, releasing norfloxacin, a known inhibitor of bacterial dna gyrase and cell proliferation.
the amount of ampicillin bound to the matrix was spectroscopically characterized, and its in vitro release rate in a weak basic medium was investigated along with assessing its antimicrobial activity.
the study revealed that the drug release rate could be modulated by the quantity of the integrated anhydride.
in order to explore the antimicrobial activity of the produced polymers, patel et al.
conducted a control experiment involving only culture without the drug, which exhibited a higher growth rate compared to the drug-present experiment.
initially, the presence of the drug alone decreased the growth rate, with the bound drug showing no effect initially.
however, after a delay of 8-16 hours, bacterial growth was inhibited, possibly due to the drug release.
this suggests that the system functions as a controlled drug release mechanism, enabling ampicillin to act following its established antibiotic action post-release.
the copolymer beads containing 2-chloro-3-hydroxypropyl were synthesized through the treatment of glycidyl methacrylate-1,4-divinylbenzene copolymer beads with hydrogen chloride.
subsequently, the resulting modified beads underwent additional treatment with triethylphosphine, tributylphosphine, and trioctylphosphine.
to determine their antibacterial efficacy, tests were conducted against e.
aureus by assessing the reduction in viable bacterial cells in suspension following exposure to the resin for a specified duration.
notably, beads treated with trioctylphosphine demonstrated pronounced antibacterial activity against both e.
aureus in water, while those treated with triethylphosphine and tributylphosphine did not exhibit the same level of effectiveness.
as an illustration, self-sterilizing packaging has the potential to remove the necessity for peroxide treatment in aseptic packaging.
this innovation could lead to self-sterilizing food products, particularly liquids, which could be beneficial for items like fruit juices with high acidity levels.
additionally, antimicrobial polymers could be applied to surfaces of food processing equipment to enable self-sanitization while in operation.
these antimicrobial surfaces could include filler gaskets, conveyors, gloves, apparel, and other personal hygiene tools.
it is crucial to take into account the specific target microorganism and food composition when designing antimicrobial packaging.
when selecting antimicrobial agents for integration into polymers, factors such as their activity spectrum, mode of action, chemical composition, and compatibility with the targeted microorganisms' growth rate and physiological state must be considered.
antimicrobial components bound to the polymer should retain their effectiveness while attached.
the effectiveness is linked to their mode of action; for instance, if they target the cell wall or membrane of microorganisms, they are more likely to remain active.
on the other hand, if penetration into the cytoplasm is required, their efficacy may be compromised.
the use of polymers in the medical field has significantly alleviated human suffering and provided a more promising outlook for a better quality of life.
its versatile applications now extend across various sectors including artificial organs, pharmaceuticals, healthcare items, implants, bone substitutes, prosthetics, wound care, food production, textiles, water treatment, and more.
the realm of antimicrobial polymers, though previously progressing slowly, is now on the brink of substantial growth, evident from the wide array of new compound classes researched in recent years.
one noteworthy advancement is the innovative technique developed by wynne and colleagues to incorporate biocidal components onto polymer surfaces.
this progression may be attributed to the increasing awareness surrounding the transmission of viruses like hiv and hepatitis through surface contact, prompting stricter health and medical guidelines mandating the use of microbiocides on most materials.
the modification of polymers and fibrous surfaces, altering characteristics like porosity and wettability of polymeric substrates, is crucial for creating implants and biomedical devices with enhanced resistance to microbial adhesion and biofilm formation.
innovative polymers can be integrated into materials like cellulose, marking a significant advancement in various fields including food packaging, textiles, wound dressing, coating of catheter tubes, and maintaining sterile surfaces.
the growing demand for infection-fighting materials will drive the exploration and utilization of antimicrobial polymers.
it is essential to ensure that newly developed biocidal polymers meet the criteria outlined in section 2 of this review.
for instance, biocidal polymers that demand contact times of hours to achieve considerable reductions in viable pathogens, while mentioned in the review, lack practical value; the desirable contact time for real-life applications should ideally be seconds or, at most, minutes.
future research should concentrate on innovating new polymeric antimicrobial substances suitable for sterilizing soil, aiming to substitute the hazardous materials, for example, methyl bromide, that are presently employed.
various intriguing concepts emerged from the assessment.
notably fascinating were utilizing dendrimers as antimicrobial agents and leveraging n-halamine polymers as biocides.
a potentially promising advancement could arise from merging these two concepts by crafting the dendrimer on an immobile base and then adapting it to create n-halamines.
the research has revealed that activities linked to power generation and energy consumption produce emissions that can impact greenhouse gases, the primary contributor to imminent global warming.
in fact, human-induced greenhouse gas emissions from energy-related activities surpass those from other human endeavors.
the study emphasized the importance of strategically addressing greenhouse gas reductions to preserve the integrity of the global environment for sustainable development and biodiversity.
additionally, it underscored the necessity of enhancing renewable energy utilization to address issues such as energy security, management, and associated health concerns.
you remember purchasing bananas, as they are a favorite, a staple in your shopping.
the decision to buy detergent was influenced by the need to clean the two shirts.
the sight of freshly cleaned floors in the supermarket may have also contributed to this choice.
while not a usual purchase, seeing a young boy dashing through the aisles reminded you of your peanut butter-loving 5-year-old nephew.
opting for a large container of ice cream was swayed by observing another shopper doing the same.
your excessive grocery shopping was likely influenced by hunger, yet the oversight of buying coffee could be attributed to thoughts of a birthday gift for your grandmother, distracting you while in the coffee aisle.
regrettably, the mere contemplation of your grandmother led to forgetfulness.

rachel granger is an accomplished associate professor at middlesex business school, specializing in economic geography and urban economies.
her recent research delves into the resurgence of high-growth metropolitan areas due to poorly executed revitalization efforts.
she conducts thorough analyses of creative, digital, and consumption economies by employing various novel research methodologies.
her international projects encompass areas such as creative and digital economies, foreign investments in cities recovering from recessions, sharing and consumption economies, innovative approaches to preserving cultural heritage and the arts, live-work initiatives in global cities, and problem-driven learning in regeneration studies.
furthermore, rachel holds the role of south east policy chair at the institute of economic development and sits on the board of three regeneration initiatives in london and the west midlands.
in the initial edition of this book, it was noted that urban regeneration is a widely recognized yet inadequately comprehended concept.
despite subsequent efforts to address this knowledge gap, there remains a necessity for further advancement in providing comprehensive insights and motivation derived from advancements in both theory and practice.
just as in the past, it is crucial to underline that urban regeneration practices do not adhere to a singular model, nor can a uniform theoretical framework be universally applied to analyze all urban challenges and craft suitable solutions.
in the significantly altered landscape of the twenty-first century, the significance of time and place cannot be overlooked, and urban regeneration must be tailored to reflect the unique local factors that shape it.
it is crucial to recognize that urban regeneration goes beyond merely reacting to changed conditions.
at times, regeneration initiatives are proactive and aim to prevent potential issues, like the impact of declining industries, or enhance the development of specific neighborhoods.
it is important to note from the beginning that there will be significant diversity within urban areas; even in affluent cities, some communities may face challenges related to poor physical conditions, environmental issues, and socio-economic disparities, while less affluent towns may have affluent districts.
urban areas have historically fulfilled various essential functions including providing shelter, security, facilitating social and political interactions, as well as enabling the sale and exchange of goods and services.
the significance of these roles has evolved over time and varied across different locations, prompting the need for land, infrastructure, and supporting amenities to adapt.
consequently, certain traditional urban areas or specific districts within them may find that their previous functions or specialized sectors are obsolete, leading to redundant facilities.
furthermore, beyond serving as a backdrop for human activities like residence, employment, and leisure, the physical infrastructure of towns and cities holds substantial economic value.
while the principles of environmentally sustainable development have not completely influenced urban areas, it is widely accepted that they will significantly shape urban regeneration and management in the future.
currently, the aftermath of the economic crisis that occurred in the early 2000s has played a predominant role in policy and practices, especially in countries like the united kingdom and other developed nations.
in looking back at the evolution of urban regeneration policy, particularly in england, it becomes evident that significant differences in policies have arisen over the last decade when comparing regeneration strategies in england with those formulated in the devolved administrations of wales, scotland, and northern ireland.
this increasing trend of divergence is anticipated to persist, particularly in times of financial constraint and a growing focus on local initiatives, leading to further distinctions in policies and approaches in the future.
by engaging in dialogue and discussion, the partners collaborate to establish mutual understanding and progress towards reaching a consensus on a vision and mission statement for the initiative.
initially, the core group of partners may recognize the importance of broadening involvement to include more individuals and organizations in the initiative.
together, the partners create methods to evaluate needs and determine the scale of the proposed undertaking.
the initiative integrates insights from the needs assessment process, along with the vision and mission statement, to formulate a plan of action.
for individual projects to thrive effectively, it is crucial to establish clear priorities within the broader scope of a strategic plan.
this involves acknowledging what can feasibly be accomplished with the available resources.
by implementing a strategic framework, various community revitalization projects can define their unique visions for enhancing the overall area.
this methodology enables a thorough examination of the strengths and weaknesses of a specific region, empowering the planning and execution of focused local initiatives in alignment with the overarching strategy.
investments in infrastructure are crucial on the supply side, requiring the construction of new roads or enhancing the current road network and other communication channels.
simultaneously, the land use planning and development system needs to adapt to deindustrialization and evolving demand trends by freeing up land for redevelopment.
an illustration of this evolution is the bolstering of the knowledge-based economy by fostering collaborations between universities, the government, and developers to establish science, technology, and business parks.
in northern ireland, the coalisland regeneration project showcases successful revitalization efforts in the heart of a once-struggling industrial town.
this initiative, spearheaded by a collaboration among the local community, public entities, and businesses, has brought about significant positive changes.
the project entailed transforming the historic cornmill into a bustling community hub, complete with amenities like parking, a water feature, and lush landscaped spaces.
additionally, disused factory buildings and vacant sites were repurposed for new economic activities.
by actively engaging the local community as equal partners throughout the project, a sense of shared ownership has deepened.
the project's effectiveness can be attributed to the community's remarkable enthusiasm and their commitment to a collaborative partnership approach.
introduced in 1987, urban regeneration grants (urgs) expanded the reach and inclusivity of the urban development grant (udg) scheme by allowing developers to engage with the government without involving local authorities.
projects eligible for urgs had to occupy more than 8 hectares.
eventually, the urg and udg schemes were combined into the city grant, a key element of the action for cities program.
this new initiative prioritized private sector leadership by providing grants directly to developers.
cardiff bay in south wales exemplifies a significant revitalization initiative, showcasing a comprehensive effort to transform a predominantly desolate area that suffered a sharp decline in the latter part of the twentieth century.
in its heyday during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, cardiff bay thrived as a crucial port and bustling commercial hub dedicated to coal exports and industries like steel manufacturing.
by 1987, the region supported around 15,000 job opportunities.
however, following the wane of these traditional sectors, the area succumbed to neglect and abandonment.
the 1990s marked a significant shift in urban regeneration practices, as highlighted earlier in this chapter.
this transition saw a move away from directing grants solely to areas believed to be most in need, towards a more competitive approach that involved bidding, forming joint ventures, and establishing partnerships that were open to all regions.
simultaneously, the significance of european regional and social funding grew.
this change underscored the importance of collaborative efforts among partners at the local level to establish strategic frameworks for driving economic development, as well as honing skills in proposal writing to access funds at various levels - local, regional, national, and european.
consequently, this evolution brought about heightened responsibility for the transparent and effective utilization of public funds for local economic development.
upon reviewing the history of financing for economic development in the uk, it becomes apparent that numerous schemes, programs, and initiatives have surfaced and faded over the last forty years.
while some have shown greater success than others, many have been too short-term to create a lasting and sustainable impact on targeted communities and regions.
often, physical regeneration has taken place without improving the quality of life in these areas.
additionally, the recent shift towards emphasizing the private sector's leadership role, amidst economic uncertainty and cutbacks, has increased the vulnerability of economic development funding to wider economic fluctuations, potentially exacerbating spatial inequalities.
nonetheless, despite these challenges, the collaborative spirit cultivated through a partnership approach to regeneration and economic development in the uk since the mid-1980s has left a legacy of continued cross-boundary and cross-agency cooperation.
in-depth consideration of utilizing open water for rejuvenation purposes may necessitate significant efforts in improving and upholding water quality, similar to the approach taken at salford quays.
conversely, obstacles such as air pollution stemming from inadequately regulated factories, as previously witnessed in specific areas of the black country due to foundry emissions, could impede new development initiatives.
addressing these challenges can prove to be costly; however, their resolution is paramount to the viability of a project and hence demands early attention in the formulation of the regeneration strategy.
furthermore, it is crucial to consider the increasingly significant elements of environmental sustainability, as well as being prepared for peak oil and transitioning towards a post-carbon future.
it is imperative that we acknowledge and adapt to the escalating demand for sustainable practices across various aspects of life, such as food production, employment, housing, energy consumption, and transportation.
achieving sustainability in all these areas will require significant shifts in workplace environments, job structures, residential preferences, and urban planning strategies.
these evolving dynamics will not only prompt extensive regeneration initiatives but will also play a pivotal role in shaping future developmental strategies and decision-making processes concerning urban renewal projects.
the evolution of local economies and individual lives can be permanently influenced by broader transformational processes that change their course.
events like the great depression of the 1930s and the deindustrialization of western economies in the late 20th century brought about profound shocks affecting finances, social structures, and physical well-being for many.
the lingering impact of the global financial crisis still affects some parts of europe today and carries significant implications.
while interim periods have seen some individuals and communities benefiting from increased income and prosperity, there are also signs of growing losses.
such losses manifest in economic slowdowns, rising unemployment rates, escalating social challenges, and the marginalization of a larger segment of society, exacerbated by certain income-redistribution policies.
the revitalization initiative featured the conversion of a historic grade ii listed watchmaking factory into the focal point of a significant housing development designed to offer specialized care to the elderly and vulnerable.
championed by the first ark group through a collaborative effort, the comprehensive regeneration strategy integrates housing, healthcare services, and social assistance.
in partnership with the local government, healthcare providers, and various organizations, the project has yielded 70 residential accommodations along with accompanying healthcare and social support amenities.
this endeavor facilitates aging and vulnerable individuals to continue residing within their community, lessening their reliance on hospitalization while also freeing up essential housing inventory.
within this framework, the right to the city concept emerges as a reaction to the increasing disparities in urban regions, driven by gentrification and the privatization of public spaces.
it advocates for increased community involvement in development efforts and policy adjustments to promote the creation of inclusive and vibrant communities that avoid marginalization.
it is important to note that not all urban revitalization efforts result in negative outcomes like gentrification and subsequent social exclusion.
emphasizing the need for urban renewal to be approached with sensitivity, it should be part of a comprehensive sustainable regeneration strategy that takes into account the needs of established communities.
this chapter delves into the intricate issues of poverty, which are closely linked to social exclusion, as a significant area of social concern.
the escalating levels of poverty represent the most pressing social challenge currently confronted by the uk.
despite the persistent efforts of regeneration experts spanning two decades or more, statistical evidence indicates a worsening climate of poverty.
empirical studies, exemplified by research conducted by the joseph rowntree foundation, highlight a range of complex issues such as displacement, insecurity, various forms of deprivation, inter-group conflicts, conflicting allegiances, and marked social disparities that surpass conventional metrics of income insufficiency.
this calls for a more sophisticated approach in regeneration initiatives.
presently, the primary focus is on addressing social disparities among ethnic communities, individuals with disabilities, children, elderly individuals, migrants, and marginalized social groups that are harder to reach.
this chapter examines the employment challenges that uk cities are encountering, along with the corresponding local and national policy measures in the framework of sustainable revitalization.
it culminates with reflections on the prospective trends in our urban labor markets.
the economic and employment situations of cities are largely shaped by their susceptibility to the widespread sectoral transformations that have occurred across the economy.
a noticeable trend has been the decrease in job opportunities within production industries, contrasted with a surge in service-related employment.
the examination presented in chapter 12, regarding the deindustrialization of american cities, revealed that those most adversely affected were reliant on manufacturing sectors and struggled to broaden their economic base.
conversely, thriving cities have managed to attract a new wave of service-based jobs, notably in professional services, leading to their prosperity.
several of these factors are well-established but can still be subject to local influences, such as initiatives supporting innovation or training programs.
however, it is essential for any local efforts to be grounded in a comprehensive knowledge of specific local conditions.
this entails that local individuals and organizations must, at the very least, acquaint themselves with fundamental ideas and data concerning the local job market.
one crucial aspect to consider is determining the nature of the job market in question.
it is commonly emphasized that the need for investment bankers transcends borders, while the need for janitors in their workplaces is restricted to the local level.
additionally, the act of commuting introduces further intricacies when it comes to determining the geographical scope for examination and intervention.
the significance of planning policy in the housing market as a form of state intervention with implications for housing supply, affordability, and the broader economy is widely recognized.
discussions surrounding the quantity and location of housing often spark strong and differing opinions.
key elements of the planning system encompass urban containment to curb urban sprawl, safeguarding of the greenbelt, and the alignment of diverse urban developments like housing, employment, and transportation.
planning processes and regulations directly influence housing prices and affordability while funds for affordable housing and infrastructure are frequently derived from new housing projects.
the primary aim of this chapter was to offer practitioners and students a comprehensive overview of key dynamics influencing housing, including the inherent tension between supply and demand, well-being, sustainability, and political ideologies.
besides discussing the evolution of housing within public policy frameworks, the goal was to provoke reflections on the placement of housing along a spectrum ranging from welfare-focused to market-oriented economic perspectives.
while traditionally emphasizing homeownership, housing provision had a significant presence in welfare state policies for many years, notably through council housing and more recently, housing associations.
the legal authority held by the involved parties is instrumental in determining the choice of delivery vehicle.
for instance, a local authority's decision to engage in a special purpose vehicle (spv) arrangement is typically based on the powers assigned under the local government act 2000, emphasizing the advancement of social, economic, and environmental well-being.
the local authority must ensure that the selected project implementation approach aligns with its goals.
following the implementation of the localism act 2011, section 1 grants local authorities broader powers equivalent to those of individuals, which may serve as a primary rationale for future participation in spv structures.
the agreement being discussed is a pre-emption agreement, which grants the developer the first opportunity to purchase the property if the seller chooses to sell.
developers may find this provision unappealing, particularly for crucial site components.
nevertheless, a developer might utilize a pre-emption agreement for land that could potentially be utilized for a future expansion of a proposed development project.
the development of a site may lead to potential conflicts with third-party rights.
if the proposed development infringes upon these rights, it could result in legal action such as an injunction to halt the development or a claim for damages.
it is crucial to conduct a thorough investigation of the site's title at an early stage.
for registered titles, this can be partially done without the landowner's cooperation by accessing information at district land registries.
however, in the case of unregistered titles, developers will need the landowner's cooperation to review the relevant title deeds and documents.
restrictive covenants refer to limitations imposed on a property title that regulate activities allowed on the premises.
to determine the enforceability of a covenant and identify the party authorized to enforce it, it is essential to understand the guidelines governing covenants.
the party benefitting from a restrictive covenant may not always be apparent, as opposed to the party burdened by it.
in many cases, the entitlement to a covenant is not recorded on the property title.
particularly with older covenants, developers might speculate that certain covenants will not be upheld.
developers should be prepared to persuade potential tenants, financial backers, and buyers that a covenant is unenforceable.
the environment act 1995 presents the statutory definition of contaminated land, which is crucial in determining whether land is considered contaminated.
according to this definition, the mere presence of harmful substances does not classify land as contaminated unless there is a potential for harm or actual harm to occur.
land is deemed contaminated only when there is a significant risk of harm to the surrounding environment or a possibility of water pollution.
consequently, it is likely that the legislation will primarily impact heavily contaminated sites.
typically, the local planning authority is granted a period of eight weeks to review and decide on a planning permission application.
this period extends to thirteen weeks for major developments and sixteen weeks if an environmental assessment is necessary.
however, timelines may surpass these limits if the case involves intricate matters, and the deadlines are often seen as flexible goals.
in situations where the local planning authority rejects the planning permission, attaches unreasonable conditions to it, or fails to make a decision within the designated timeframe, an appeal can be made.
the appeal process might entail a public inquiry, and the final decisions resulting from it can take several months to be reached.
therefore, it is crucial to begin by obtaining a practical planning evaluation of the proposed project.
certain types of development must receive approval from the secretary of state before being granted permission by the local planning authority.
for instance, developments planned for the green belt may fall under this category.
the secretary of state reserves the right to review these applications, potentially leading to a public inquiry and causing considerable delays in the planning process.
hence, it is crucial to promptly recognize any applications requiring referral to the secretary of state.
section 106 agreements are commonly utilized to enable the granting of planning permission.
these agreements entail commitments or promises made by the developer to execute what is termed as planning gain.
this may involve constraints on land usage or development, specific activities to be carried out, or monetary contributions.
such obligations are enforceable on future landowners.
a common obligation within such agreements is the provision of a percentage of affordable housing within a residential project.
as of april 2015, local planning authorities are restricted from aggregating more than five section 106 contributions towards a singular infrastructure project or purpose.
listed building consent is required if the proposed development includes alterations that impact the heritage value of a listed building.
in addition to securing planning permission, obtaining listed building consent is essential.
information on whether a property is listed can be acquired through the local council.
it is crucial to assess early on if listed building consent will be needed, as the process mirrors that of planning permission, often proceeding simultaneously with similar time frames and appeal rights.
when considering the demolition of a building located in a conservation area, a local authority search can determine if the site falls within such a designated zone.
if it is confirmed to be within a conservation area, obtaining planning permission may be necessary for the demolition.
furthermore, any planning application submitted for approval within a conservation area will face closer scrutiny, particularly regarding the proposed design of the project or scheme.
additionally, trees situated in a conservation area are also afforded special protection under the regulations.
to carry out a development as per planning permission, it might be required to close or redirect a public highway.
the town and country planning act 1990 and highways act 1980 provide specific procedures for shutting down or rerouting public pathways when necessary.
it is important to allocate extra time and budget for these processes in the development schedule and seek professional legal guidance as needed.
this chapter offers an overview of the key legal aspects relevant to planning and executing an urban revitalization plan or project.
it highlights the various specific circumstances and contexts where unique legal considerations come into play.
overall, the primary emphasis is on the importance of seeking expert legal counsel early in the process of an urban revitalization initiative.
by doing so, potential challenges and barriers can be proactively addressed, necessary approvals and agreements can be secured promptly, thus mitigating unnecessary delays and cost overruns.
being proactive and taking early steps can effectively avert complications and prevent them from escalating into major issues.
assessing, tracking, and appraising urban revitalization projects is a crucial responsibility for policymakers.
typically, securing funding and assistance for these initiatives is contingent upon establishing a robust monitoring and evaluation system.
furthermore, with numerous stakeholders and entities engaged in urban regeneration efforts, it is essential to showcase the advantages of these endeavors and analyze the root causes and repercussions of encountered challenges.
fundamentally, monitoring and evaluation aim to determine the activities carried out, as well as the resultant outcomes and effects of these endeavors.
revising goals
an important reason for measuring and monitoring progress is to facilitate the evaluation and adjustment of a revitalization plan or strategy while also addressing any emerging challenges.
should an unanticipated change occur, it might become necessary to reassess the projected objectives.
in such scenarios, additional tactics may need to be implemented to attract more businesses to the area, support existing companies to expand, or modify the overall strategy.
such reviews and adjustments are routine and should not be seen as a sign of the failure of the initial strategy or its execution.
nevertheless, it could be that the original target was overly ambitious or unforeseen issues have arisen that could have been predicted.
therefore, the assessment process serves as valuable feedback for policy refinement or ensuring its alignment with objectives.
market failure in the commercial property sector can lead to a lack of appropriate space for current businesses to expand, hindering inward investment and the establishment of new enterprises.
consequently, this situation might diminish opportunities for unemployed individuals in the area to secure employment, worsening market failure in the local job market due to prolonged joblessness and declining skills among the jobless workforce.
therefore, tackling these challenges requires a comprehensive and coordinated approach, encompassing various issues, with policy focus determined by the priority level of each problem.
this information lacks details on inner-city unemployment characteristics, such as the average duration of joblessness, the demographics and skill levels of the unemployed individuals, and the concentration of unemployment geographically.
it also does not cover individuals looking for work but not officially registered, offer insights into potential future worsening of the issue, or delve into underemployment, skills shortages, recruitment challenges, and mismatches between labor demand and supply.
a crucial aspect of defining a problem is specifying the target groups and geographical areas that the policy aims to impact.
to ensure maximum cost-effectiveness, it is imperative that policy outcomes benefit the intended groups.
for instance, a policy geared towards generating employment opportunities for unemployed residents in inner-city areas may not achieve its goals if commuters from outside the area secure the jobs created, leaving the intended beneficiaries without access to these opportunities.
similarly, subsidies provided to businesses may lead to increased profits rather than delivering substantial benefits to the local urban economy and residents.
these instances underscore the risk of policies missing their mark in the absence of evaluation or impact models to guide policymakers.
additionally, considerations of cost-effectiveness prompt inquiries into how various groups respond to policy interventions.
when setting strategy objectives, it is crucial to ensure they directly address identified problems and their root causes, align with the strategy's agreed priorities, and are both realistic and attainable within the existing constraints.
defining objectives for urban regeneration policy interventions involves establishing a hierarchy of objectives, starting with an overarching aim followed by strategic objectives specific to a program or project, such as property and physical infrastructure development.
by delineating clear program or project objectives, it becomes feasible to outline operational objectives and goals tied to individual targets and milestones.
measuring and monitoring the level of participation and uptake in a program or project is crucial, especially in economic and social initiatives that rely on voluntary involvement, such as business support programs and community-focused projects.
effective management of a project hinges on having precise and prompt data about the targeted participation, which is especially vital in pioneering schemes where modifications may be needed if the uptake does not meet expectations.
biases in participation and coverage can arise due to self-selection, disparities in information access among various demographic groups, and individuals choosing not to participate in the program.
the main concern here is the challenging task of determining and quantifying the potential outcomes if a policy or program had not been implemented, known as the counterfactual or deadweight.
proving effectiveness involves demonstrating causation, and additionality is present when there is a deviation from the expected outcome in the absence of the policy intervention, in other words, a departure from the counterfactual.
therefore, additionality occurs when the results or advantages of the policy would not have occurred without the policy in place.
the issue of additionality can be relevant to both intermediate results and the ultimate outcomes of the policy.
furthermore, increased property investments in the area following the demonstration effects of the ez can lead to broader spillover effects.
such effects may include the concentration of businesses in key sectors due to inward investments, the dissemination of technology from innovative businesses enhancing their performance, enhancements in the area's reputation, and favorable outcomes for disadvantaged groups and the unemployed as job prospects increase and spread more evenly, thereby resulting in social advantages for local communities.
analyzing and quantifying the expenses linked to an urban renewal plan is crucial when creating metrics to assess the effectiveness of a program or project, determining if additional resources should be allocated, and enhancing the efficiency of resource distribution among various projects within the scheme.
consequently, decision-makers, administrators, and sponsors are consistently challenged with determining the most efficient allocation of limited resources to meet the goals of the regeneration strategy.
the purpose of this methodology is to evaluate various geographically targeted programs and projects.
challenges arise when assessing the cost-effectiveness of initiatives focused on enhancing job opportunities for specific groups like ethnic minorities or the long-term unemployed, rather than just generating new jobs within a particular location.
in such cases, the evaluation needs to focus on determining the unique advantages for the targeted groups in that area.
the chapter delves into an in-depth discussion outlining various concepts, procedures, and methods essential for measuring, monitoring, and evaluating urban regeneration.
regardless of the urban regeneration's objectives or the evolving landscape of organizations, partnerships, and policy interventions, it remains vital for partners to clearly articulate their rationale, goals, strategies for goal-setting and achievement, as well as their approach to measuring, monitoring, and evaluating their interventions.
this section underscores that the fundamental rules and procedures governing measurement, monitoring, and evaluation remain largely consistent over time.
while terminology may vary between entities such as the treasury, government departments, agencies, the european commission, and private funding institutions, the core principles endure.
the following section summarizes the key issues and steps pertaining to measurement, monitoring, and evaluation.
past regeneration approaches offer valuable lessons.
margaret thatcher's focus on property-led regeneration favored business interests over local residents in need.
while the srb aimed to pool financial resources from various local authority departments, its proposals often failed to thoroughly assess underlying problem causes and effective delivery methods.
consequently, the actual root issues were overlooked, as well as the efficacy of suggested interventions.
furthermore, assigning the implementation of certain srb projects to external contractors lacked the holistic approach necessary for successful outcomes.
comprehending the problem an efficient revitalization plan hinges on a comprehensive understanding of the existing issues, the root causes of the current circumstances, and the individuals or entities impacted by them.
degeneration typically evolves through intricate and prolonged processes influenced by various interconnected factors, some originating externally such as wars or the global economy, and mostly stemming from internal shifts in housing policies, services, and economic ventures.
identifying these factors is crucial for a successful regeneration initiative.
in the uk, a noticeable similarity exists in the landscape.
the deindustrialization of the industrial heartlands in regions like the midlands, northeast, and northwest started in the early 1970s and persisted throughout the 1980s, causing significant damage to cities such as glasgow, newcastle, leeds, manchester, liverpool, sheffield, nottingham, and birmingham.
this resulted in substantial alterations to the economic and demographic foundations of numerous industrial areas.
while urban renewal initiatives have been implemented in both the uk and the us, real estate developments and the growth of service sector employment were strategies used to counter the effects of deindustrialization in the period leading up to and following the turn of the millennium.
however, these efforts were severely impacted by the global financial crisis, affecting cities in both the uk and the us before spiraling into a full-blown crisis and a global recession.
rapidly increasing rates of new housing development resulted in the addition of 2,500 condominiums to the downtown area within the five-year period leading up to 2006, specifically targeting young professionals due to their proximity to arts and cultural institutions as well as entertainment districts.
however, in hindsight, neither approach proved sustainable.
the association of renovated housing with problematic lending practices of financial institutions collaborating with low-income demographics, notably tied to foreclosures and contributing to the banking crisis, became evident.
simultaneously, the new condominium projects faced significant challenges, including high vacancy rates.
as the crisis unfolded and service industry employment declined, the city witnessed the departure of these same mobile professionals and tourists who were initially attracted to the city for its revitalization efforts.
ilex is an urban regeneration company in northern ireland dedicated to driving sustainable economic, physical, and social rejuvenation in derry-londonderry.
the company has played a vital role in overseeing the successful completion of significant projects like the peace bridge and the city of culture in 2013, as well as spearheading the ongoing rebirth of the ebrington barracks in the city's heart.
similarly, the town centre partnership fund in wales aims to bolster town center collaborations.
initiatives in newport, neath port talbot, blaenau gwent, rhondda cynon taff, vale of glamorgan, and wrexham are working towards varying goals, such as reducing fuel poverty and empty properties, diversifying land usage to include residential and recreational facilities, and expanding wifi coverage.
this array of urban development initiatives underscores the unique compositions and requirements of individual local communities.
in northern ireland, the review of public administration's phased introduction, rearrangement of local authority borders, and strengthening of local government will result in planning, community planning, well-being, and regeneration becoming local government duties.
notably, in alignment with a recurring theme in northern ireland, regeneration remains closely intertwined with community development.
the shift of regeneration authority to local councils following over four decades of centralized control will subject local government to scrutiny, necessitating strong leadership, foresight, and self-assurance to meet community expectations and engage effectively with its varied populace.
urban areas across europe are facing the common challenge of urban regeneration.
the prevailing trend over the last 25 years has been the adoption of integrated urban regeneration as the primary approach, albeit with variations in its implementation across different countries and cities.
evaluating the effectiveness of integrated urban regeneration is crucial, and there is now a well-established history of assessing urban regeneration initiatives and ventures to determine good or best practices.
the acknowledgment of an urban dimension in different eu policies has grown, with particular emphasis placed on urban matters by the directorate-general for regional policy of the european commission.
this directorate-general oversees regional policy and cohesion and prioritizes projects aimed at enhancing the economic performance and quality of life in urban areas, as well as fostering the overall development of the regions they are situated in.
while the d-g regio plays a key role in urban issues, various other commission services are also engaged in a wide array of urban-related activities.
brownfields are typically deserted industrial or commercial areas linked to previous economic activities.
these sites commonly involve old docklands that used to support sea trade before containerization, outdated high-rise commercial buildings, neglected manufacturing facilities, parts of railways, empty gas stations, once-thriving retail locations, and so on.
they are usually owned by a single entity, often the government or private industry; they are of a scale comparable to greenfield sites for development; they may be contaminated to varying degrees based on their past use; and they are uninhabited, eliminating the necessity for community involvement to the extent needed for greyfields.
the steelworks, a former waterfront site, became outdated by the latter part of the twentieth century.
the evolution of global shipping necessitated deeper draughts for larger vessels and the demand for sophisticated container terminals and efficient freight-forwarding infrastructure, rendering the original facilities inadequate.
as many heavy industries sought more favorable conditions for production and access to global markets, they relocated to countries with more advantageous factors.
this shift mirrors a common trend observed in cities across various developed nations.
due to the implementation of the better cities program, brownfield sites in docklands, melbourne have gained appeal to the property development and finance sectors.
this has led to the successful creation of a development framework for carrying out significant projects like southbank, docklands, and federation square in melbourne, as well as darling harbour and barangaroo in sydney, newport quays in port adelaide, and southbank in brisbane.
these projects play a crucial role in revitalizing neglected urban areas and contributing to the increasing housing supply in expanding cities.
however, their contribution is not expected to fully meet the overall demand for new infill housing in metropolitan areas.
the authors acknowledge the risks involved in trying to condense the broad spectrum of current experiences into a single summary of existing challenges or in projecting a definitive vision of future possibilities.
they emphasize that the insights provided reflect their personal perspectives on the current landscape and potential future developments, recognizing the limitations inherent in these endeavors.
urban planning is essentially a strategic endeavor that revolves around formulating and attaining a well-defined vision for necessary actions.
it encompasses the entirety of the urban environment and involves seeking short-term fixes for immediate challenges while embracing long-term strategies to forecast and prevent potential issues.
it adopts an interventionist stance without being overly prescriptive, often most successfully carried out through collaborative efforts.
urban planning focuses on establishing priorities and facilitating their accomplishment, aiming to benefit a variety of organizations, entities, and communities.
it draws support from diverse expertise and financial sources and can be quantified, assessed, and revised as needed.
it is tailored to the distinct requirements and possibilities within a specific region, city, town, or neighborhood and is interlinked with other pertinent policy realms and initiatives.
the conversation raises the question of the most suitable scale for urban regeneration efforts, and finding a definitive answer proves challenging.
in the past three decades of the twentieth century, the focus on defining urban issues and crafting urban policies has oscillated between very local levels, city-regions, neighborhoods or districts, regions, and now back to neighborhoods, with a growing emphasis on city-region perspectives.
the combination of partnership, strategy, and sustainable development plays a crucial role in shaping and propelling successful urban regeneration.
these elements are essential for ensuring that urban renewal goes beyond its individual components and sets the stage for cohesive and holistic initiatives.
throughout this book, these key roles and attributes have been prominently featured as fundamental principles underpinning the broader impact of urban regeneration on the establishment of sustainable communities.
each of these factors serves a distinct purpose and contributes in its own unique way to the overall advancement of urban renewal efforts.
frequent users of healthcare services often experience unexplained symptoms, with as many as two-thirds of them showing signs of psychiatric comorbidity and some even revealing suicidal thoughts if prompted.
neurologists must not only identify functional symptoms but also effectively engage with and treat patients for whom no definite organic cause has been identified.
this article aims to tackle the typical queries that neurologists encounter when treating patients with functional symptoms.
antidepressants can be beneficial in treating patients experiencing functional symptoms and have shown effectiveness even in individuals without a depressive syndrome.
they have been proven to alleviate emotional dysregulation, a trait linked to functional symptoms.
inadequate dosage and treatment duration are frequent causes of non-response to antidepressants.
it is worth noting that a significant proportion of neurological outpatients believe antidepressants are addictive and can cause physical harm.
patients who understand the purpose of medication are more inclined to adhere to the treatment regimen.
we introduce a novel r software package called lawstat, which encompasses a wide array of statistical tests and methodologies commonly used in diverse legal fields such as securities law, antitrust law, equal employment, and discrimination.
additionally, these statistical tools find applications in public policy and biostatistics.
in addition to classical tests like the bartels test, runs test, homogeneity tests for multiple sample proportions, brunner-munzel tests, lorenz curve, cochran-mantel-haenszel test, and others, the package offers innovative distribution-free robust tests for symmetry, robust normality tests designed to be more sensitive to heavy-tailed deviations, measures of relative variability, levene-type tests for detecting trends in variances, among others.
each test and methodology is accompanied by simulations and practical examples drawn from legal cases, economics, and biostatistics.
despite the name lawstat, the package goes beyond legal statistics and explores statistical procedures with application across various fields like biostatistics, environmental studies, social sciences, and beyond.
therefore, the name of the package should not be interpreted as limiting its use to legal statistics exclusively.
a cohesive series of community research projects is essential to create and assess interventions across different environments, accompanied by policy and macroeconomic investigations at the national level.
these should include strategies like fuel pricing incentives to enhance access for underprivileged individuals to cleaner fuel sources.
additionally, implementing a systematic, standardized method for monitoring exposure levels and patterns within diverse impoverished rural and urban communities is crucial.
increased demand, rising energy costs, and decreased production have inadvertently resulted in heightened food prices.
furthermore, agricultural policies, such as those implemented by the eu, prioritize safeguarding local farmers and markets.
however, these protectionist measures can create challenges for rural farmers in developing nations to sustain or enhance their output, thereby fueling widespread urbanization.
this scenario highlights the intricate global interdependence between production and consumption.
the key takeaway from this narrative is the necessity of a comprehensive approach that considers the interconnectedness of different social spheres.
in other words, a systemic viewpoint is crucial for addressing both the myriad issues at hand and their viable resolutions.
in the dynamic landscape, new alternatives may emerge to challenge existing options, leading to increased pressures on dominant choices and heightened tensions among diverse actors, strategies, powers, and institutions.
given the high uncertainties surrounding these changes, various actors may have different views on the urgency of the problem and the preferred direction forward.
a comprehensive understanding of past, present, and potential future dynamics necessitates a long-term perspective that takes into account interactions across various scales, actors, and domains, as well as encourages interdisciplinary research.
the transition approach, highlighted in this book, serves as a central framework that offers this encompassing viewpoint.
the historical context of energy systems plays a crucial role in determining the feasibility of transitioning to sustainable energy systems.
as highlighted in chapters 2 and 4 of this book, it is essential to consider longer time horizons beyond traditional policy frameworks.
to effectively navigate the shift towards sustainable energy, there is a need to find a balance between incremental changes within existing systems and the swift adoption of successful alternatives.
this requires the development of forward-thinking and flexible strategies that go beyond conventional policy approaches.
it suggests the necessity for innovative governance structures capable of fostering new technologies, institutions, behaviors, and mindsets while also preparing for potential systemic disruptions.
essentially, the goal is to create governance frameworks that can break the current inertia of established energy systems and pave the way for transformative changes.
chapter 2 of this volume delves into the historical transitions in fuel consumption by humans as outlined by vincent lagendijk and geert verbong.
it traces the shift from societies reliant on organic resources and manpower for energy to industrialized societies powered by fossil fuels, notably coal initially, and later in the twentieth century, an increasing dependence on oil and natural gas.
these fossil fuels formed the cornerstone of the expanding energy infrastructure, encompassing electrical grids, gas networks, and to a lesser extent, heating systems.
the authors highlight key landscape changes post-second world war that significantly shaped the evolution of energy systems, and discuss how governments, notably the eu, responded to energy crises, fluctuating prices, geopolitical influences, and the escalating concerns about the unsustainable nature of current energy practices.
in chapter 9 of this book, geert verbong and frank geels utilize the transition pathway typology originally proposed by geels and schot to investigate potential future scenarios for the electricity system.
these scenarios range from the establishment of a super grid connecting large-scale renewable energy sources across europe and north africa to a shift towards local and regional self-sufficient electricity systems.
this examination illustrates that there are multiple pathways towards achieving a more sustainable electricity system.
while discussions around energy transitions often emphasize technological advancements, it is highlighted that technological feasibility is not the sole determining factor; economic, socio-cultural, and institutional dynamics will also play crucial roles in shaping future transitions.
environmental considerations, such as addressing climate change, are among the various factors influencing the evolution of energy systems, alongside cost-effectiveness, reliability, reduced dependency, and social aspects.
therefore, it is essential not to assume that we are automatically progressing towards a more sustainable future.
to tackle these challenges effectively, we must consider how various components of a system move and interact, and how their mobility influences the possibility of convergence.
furthermore, it is essential to explore how the influence or supremacy of individual components within the system's structure, collectively shape its dynamics.
when viewed in this context, it becomes less clear that nation-states are always the most suitable units for reference or examination.
in reaching a conclusion, i aim to revisit the initial discussion and explore the connection between supply and consumption and its significance in the analysis of energy transitions.
writers focusing on emerging energy sources, such as the promotion and spread of sustainable or renewable alternatives, often emphasize the potential for substitution.
the underlying belief is that less harmful supply options have the capacity to replace those that contribute to co2 emissions and other associated damages.
this chapter delves into the ongoing research.
drawing from the multi-level perspective on sustainability transitions discussed in this book, the focus is on investigating how incumbent energy regimes experience both stability and change.
by examining the factors influencing the resistance to change within these regimes, the chapter makes theoretical and empirical contributions.
it begins by defining the concept of a regime as the primary unit of analysis and suggests modifications to current regime analysis methods.
specifically, it advocates for an equal emphasis on analyzing both stability and change within regimes, encourages a global perspective on transitions and regime dynamics, and explores how interactions between landscapes and regimes can shape negotiations surrounding transnational regime stability and change.
nevertheless, numerous attributes of the traditional governance system persist in reality.
specifically, when new transnational pipelines are constructed, they still rely on extensive long-term contractual agreements, just as they did in the past, due to similar rationales.
ccs holds the promise of reducing co2 emissions from fossil fuel power plants and other co2 point sources, offering a solution to maintain current energy provision practices while addressing climate change.
engineers worldwide are actively exploring methods to capture and store co2 deep underground.
two primary approaches to capturing co2 from the air include utilizing organisms for photosynthesis and isolating co2 from concentrated waste streams.
carbon sequestration through growing biomass, such as trees, plants, or algae, presents a viable method for capturing co2 from the atmosphere.
by employing biomass as a power plant feedstock, it creates a nearly closed-loop system with a limited atmospheric retention duration.
the study also found that 70 percent of the population was not familiar with ccs, making their views more of a pseudo-opinion that could easily shift with new information.
researchers argue that the public lacks understanding of the link between coal power plant electricity production, co2 emissions, and global warming.
when provided with comprehensive information on the technology, there is lukewarm support ranging from 60 to 65 percent.
however, this data might change if other mitigation alternatives like conservation or renewables are considered.
although not without challenges, the deliberate establishment of a worldwide market segment via a policy initiative faced opposition from grassroots groups and involved scientists.
the transition from decentralized biogas production to a centralized model was contested by local energy advocates, like the folkecenter for renewable energy, who initially lacked backing from policy measures.
nevertheless, they served as a small faction safeguarding ongoing local experimental projects for decentralized plants.
this safeguarding eventually led to a resurgence of decentralized biogas facilities at the farm level in denmark during the latter part of the 1990s.
the second discussion centered around environmental issues, ranging from local concerns like smog to broader global challenges such as climate change.
due to the government's skepticism towards the environmental benefits of biofuels derived from agricultural crops, projects were primarily backed to aid farmers' livelihoods rather than their ecological impact.
support was provided on a case-by-case basis, typically as a result of advocacy from local politicians and biofuel proponents affiliated with national political parties.
it was not until 2003, following pressure from the eu's biofuel directive, that a formal policy on biofuels was established by the dutch government.
nevertheless, previous bioenergy trials primarily relied on local and uniform biomass sources like waste resources from timber processing sectors, whereas utilities required larger quantities.
to address this challenge, they began experimenting with a wider range of organic waste materials including sewage sludge and demolition wood, in addition to importing biomass from developing nations.
the shift towards diversifying biomass sources was seen as a positive step away from coal by some, although it stirred controversy.
local communities and environmental ngos contended that incinerating materials like demolition wood in coal plants led to a rise in harmful emissions.
furthermore, importing biomass from developing countries raised concerns about monoculture practices, exploitation of indigenous communities, and increased emissions related to global transportation.
the importance of private end-users is often overlooked by both governments and industries when examining the adoption of energy technology, which can hinder progress.
the swift adoption of a groundbreaking technology can catch many stakeholders off guard due to its potentially disruptive impacts.
the spread of new technology in the market is likely to be met with resistance from those who were not previously involved.
in reaction to the integration of this new technology into the existing energy system, entities within that system may try to confine the emerging technology to maintain control over its disruptive capabilities.
consequently, new players find themselves out of the technological innovation system (tis), limiting their ability to capitalize on potential opportunities.
a useful analogy is to think of the stages of ecosystem development.
initially, a developing ecosystem may have poor soil conditions that only support basic vegetation.
these pioneer plants play a crucial role in modifying their environment, leading to improved conditions that can then support more diverse and demanding species.
ecosystems can progress into more intricate systems or face a decline over time.
although predicting the precise dynamics may be challenging, the concept of succession is valuable in unraveling the mechanisms that drive ecosystem development.
the event history analysis method offers a robust approach to conducting case studies that are comparable.
when executed effectively, a set of case studies has the potential to yield theoretical understandings of the dynamics of emerging technologies.
given the insights gained thus far, there is a compelling interest in constructing a framework that links different forms of cumulative causation, such as innovation drivers.
the prospect of these drivers building upon one another presents valuable opportunities for intervention strategies.
given the significant impact that socio-technical transitions bring about, it is essential to carefully examine the involvement of civil society in these transitions, both through empirical study and theoretical perspectives.
it is crucial to understand the aspirations held by civil associations and the roles they fulfill in the transition processes.
it is important to determine when and where their actions are significant and why they matter.
exploring the type of policy backing that could enhance the effectiveness and credibility of civil associations in shaping new and sustainable energy systems is also crucial.
in addition to perceiving transitions as events that happen to communities, it is essential to analyze the transition processes that originate from civil society and how civil society reacts to the disruptions brought by the transition.
it is essential to deliberate on the implications of these findings for policy-making, businesses, and civil associations.
the objective of this chapter is to establish a connection between civil society activities in sustainable energy and socio-technical transitions theory.
examining all these procedures collectively might lead some to regard civil society engagements as potentially playing a role in systematic transition management.
however, this perspective would overstep its bounds.
undoubtedly, the varied viewpoints and initiatives within civil society could and should become more involved in public discussions regarding energy transition strategies.
regardless of participation in these discussions, developments within civil society groups consistently introduce new values, standards, and opportunities to socio-technical systems.
nonetheless, despite civil society always being a significant factor in socio-technical systems and their changes, it's crucial to acknowledge that it's not a singular or controllable entity.
if it were, it would no longer maintain its essence as civil society.
in this field of study, significant and often divergent changes in the landscape exert immense pressure on the existing regime.
consequently, the regime encounters substantial internal challenges, leading to its breakdown, erosion, and disarray.
confidence among regime actors in the sustainability of the current system diminishes.
the destabilization of the regime introduces uncertainty regarding the areas in which innovation efforts should be focused.
as the regime begins to disintegrate, a stable niche innovation is not yet established, but eventually, one alternative will emerge as dominant.
the prolonged period of uncertainty due to the absence of a clear substitute is marked by the coexistence of various niche innovations and widespread experimentation.
this may prompt a substantial restructuring of the system, culminating in its realignment and reinstitutionalization into a new regime, with the involvement of new actors, guiding principles, beliefs, and practices.
we view the etp as an emerging specialized area of policy within the existing dominant energy policy framework.
initially led by a small group of civil servants, this initiative evolved into fostering a diverse social network and transition agenda.
our analysis indicates that the etp has successfully evolved into the primary framework for energy innovation policies in the dutch energy policy sector.
although now a well-established niche, it has not managed to shift the prevailing energy regime, as the netherlands still struggles with inadequate sustainable energy production, heavy reliance on fossil fuels, and rising energy consumption.
the lack of a successful transition prompts reflection on how transition management unfolded at the national level, the actual outcomes of these efforts, and how they should be evaluated.
while the previous sections have demonstrated the etp's success in creating various innovative initiatives, strategies, and projects, it is evident that a significant societal and policy change towards energy transition has not taken place in the netherlands.
the nation is now moving towards a phase where the competition between the etp and the existing energy policy framework will grow stronger.
as the etp has progressed and alternative options have grown, established interests are becoming more defensive.
simply relying on innovation and vision-based strategies is no longer adequate to expand the etp further.
subsequently, the platforms sought out visionary individuals, specifically those from leading companies or pioneering segments within larger corporations, to participate as individuals rather than company representatives.
while intentionally limiting their size, each platform established methods to consistently engage with a broader range of stakeholders.
this allowed for discussions on platform-developed plans and ensured that valuable innovative concepts present in the market were adopted by the platform.
a significant challenge facing the energy transition platform (etp) is the necessity for a widespread adoption and expansion of innovative advancements, which would require a fundamental shift in the current energy system and therefore a direct confrontation with the existing energy establishment.
the etp aims to drive this transformation through coordinated efforts involving its platforms and the et-board.
however, the effective realization of this transition demands the formulation and implementation of new strategies and tools, raising doubts as to their feasibility within the present policy framework.
notably, a surge in energy transition activities is observed at the regional and local levels, where municipalities are striving to construct energy-efficient buildings surpassing current standards and establish local renewable energy sources.
meanwhile, numerous small innovative enterprises are advocating for the execution of their pioneering concepts.
environmental factions within political entities have successfully pushed for the inclusion of energy transition in parliamentary discussions.
furthermore, many local communities are independently developing their energy generation methods.
it is arguable that the momentum of energy transition is shifting towards decentralization, with regional, local, and grassroots initiatives increasingly dictating the course and pace of this transition.
the next challenge is to enhance and expand the focus on sustainability within the etp.
it is important to engage a wider range of societal stakeholders and consumers in this effort.
the etp has put forth clear and ambitious perspectives and transition pathways that are now available.
the goal is to encourage alignment among consumers and stakeholders around these guiding principles, transforming them into shared societal objectives to achieve significant political influence.
leaders in various sectors, such as business, local and regional initiatives, as well as political and social organizations, should be given more opportunities for innovative projects and better support.
one key consideration is the role that national policy can play, given the complexities associated with decentralized and diverse bottom-up processes.
once innovative advancements are ready for market implementation, they may be incorporated into regulatory frameworks.
instances of this include the energy-label requirement, which homeowners must comply with when selling their homes, the phase-out of traditional light bulbs, the introduction of feed-in tariffs, and the enforcement of energy standards for new constructions.
while these changes represent incremental progress, they signify a growing consensus and willingness to address these issues.
nevertheless, there is doubt about whether policymakers will be capable of making more radical and large-scale decisions in this arena, given the rising uncertainties and societal divisions.
this dimension encompasses the easily observable inputs, activities, outputs, and outcomes of projects, transition dynamics, and developments in the program portfolio.
the third dimension revolves around normative sustainability, which involves assessing real changes and guiding scenarios based on sustainability criteria and their effectiveness.
effective program management entails aligning these dimensions to facilitate changes in practices, culture, and structure in line with a sustainable guiding scenario.
the association of a hub with negative implications as a collector of detrimental emissions and waste contrasts with the positive, environmentally-friendly image of a green gas hub.
following a series of conversations, the platform explored the linkages between various hubs.
several months down the line, the gas hub took center stage on the etp front page as a key initiative endorsed by the etp.
the platform further focused on establishing local green gas hubs where diverse digesters collaborate to extract, gather, and treat biogas and integrate it into the existing gas distribution system.
the introduction of micro-chp involves encouraging an adaptation-absorption pattern that has gained wide support from the current installation sector, energy companies, boiler manufacturers, and established networks for coordination and advocacy.
however, there is concern about the potential drawbacks of this consensus-based approach, particularly in transitioning towards distributed electricity supply systems.
it raises the question of whether this strategy could lead to early entrenchment.
key players in the installation and boiler manufacturing sectors might believe they have made sufficient contributions and resist other innovative technologies like fuel cells and smart grids, which could pose a challenge to their interests and expertise in micro-chp.
these criteria suggest the emergence of an international epistemic community focused on sustainability transitions.
this community consists of experts from various disciplines who embrace norms promoting sustainability transitions, share beliefs on transition mechanisms, and engage in collaborative policy efforts.
by leveraging this network, there is potential to expand the integration of transition management concepts into policymaking worldwide beyond the netherlands.
this community has the capacity to adapt key transition management principles to diverse institutional settings, positioning itself as a key player in facilitating policy development and knowledge exchange.
the chapter contended that although the success of the energy transition policy (etp) was not clearly evaluated, its appeal suggested that transition management ideas could potentially be influential in other countries.
the following sections explored how the dissemination of these ideas might occur.
the text introduced discourse analysis as a method to examine the function of the science-policy interface, which was pivotal in implementing transition management in the netherlands.
a comparison was made with a case study in the uk, where a policy process aimed to facilitate the shift to a low carbon economy.
distinctions in the roles of the science-policy interfaces in these cases were highlighted.
while researchers played a significant part in integrating transition management ideas into dutch energy policy, their contribution to framing the energy transition policy challenge was limited in the uk study.
this evaluation has raised concerns regarding the potential involvement of researchers in transferring transition management ideas into uk policy.
the system requirements for an energy transition indicate the desired outcomes required from the governance frameworks.
these include refraining from new investments in high-carbon production, upholding elevated energy costs and a consistent co2 pricing structure, enforcing rigorous building codes and efficiency standards for products and processes, coordinating the infrastructure of grids and power system operations, advocating for smart grid initiatives and implementing access regulations at a local level, providing financial backing for large-scale technologies like grids, ccs, and district heating, and backing smaller-scale technologies such as heat pumps.
the subsequent section will assess the extent to which the european union's policy agendas align with these frameworks.
eu innovation governance has historically leaned heavily on voluntary mechanisms due to the complex nature of regulating innovation.
however, eu policymakers have increasingly realized the effectiveness of employing strict regulations and prohibitions as stimuli for innovation within industries.
notable instances include regulations concerning co2 emissions for cars and the prohibition of incandescent light bulbs.
throughout various energy system sectors, we have witnessed the initiation of rather ambitious policies, regulations, and directives at either the eu level or within individual member states.
despite these efforts, inconsistencies persist within the policy frameworks, leading to delays in their execution.
the effectiveness of implementing changes relies heavily on the governance of institutional and political conditions.
it is evident that the institutional and political factors shaping policies act as both an impediment to and a consequence of the energy transition.
the key question remains: what forms of governance will harmonize with and propel policies geared towards transitioning?
while i can only offer some insights into potential solutions, i aim to delve into ongoing governance trends and issues, evaluating their significance and impacts concerning the envisioned shift towards low carbon energy.
this suggests the need for more advanced development in the governance and management of transitions from a meta-governance perspective, encompassing both analysis and practical guidance.
from an analytical standpoint, the book has highlighted several transition governance challenges, emphasizing the importance of comprehending the roles played by regime actors' agency, civil society organizations, and citizens, as well as the co-evolution between niche and regime actors, institutional and cognitive transformations, and the interplay among different advocacy coalitions promoting diverse transition scenarios.
from a prescriptive angle, the insights provided in this book seem to underscore the imperative of enhancing strategies for governance and management to address the evolving dynamics in transitions.
as pressures mount on existing regimes and niches mature, the focus of energy transition governance naturally shifts from fostering networks, innovations, and alternative visions to grappling with issues such as power dynamics, resistance, institutional changes, and more.
the decision about which energy system to adopt will ultimately be made through political decision-making processes.
a key difference from previous transitions is the current politicized debate surrounding the future sustainability of energy systems.
in this scenario, a dominant regime not only favors incremental change but also wields the power to dictate the pace and direction of changes.
however, analyses from a transition perspective and studies on climate impact and resource availability underscore the urgent need to rapidly develop viable alternatives.
this underscores the importance of a normative shift towards transition management, focusing on expediting and directing sustainability transitions that either counter, override, or co-evolve with incremental optimizations.
the primary challenge lies in creating conditions that allow for the emergence of sustainable pathways and speeding up the transformation within energy systems.
transition management should address three critical challenges: changes in infrastructure, institutions, and policy tools as we progress into the next phase of energy transitions.
on smaller scales, these global challenges present themselves in various forms, such as regions lacking access to energy resources or facing severe social and ecological consequences from the extraction of fossil fuels.
it is important to also acknowledge the diverse ways in which climate change affects local communities, including through droughts, water scarcity, and shifts in ecosystems.
consequently, there is a demand for localized institutions capable of bridging the gap between global problems and their local repercussions, as well as between worldwide solutions and their practical applications at the local level.
moreover, there is a necessity for intermediary organizations that can facilitate connections across different scales in terms of overall objectives, sharing of knowledge, and broadening the reach of successful innovations.
the conclusions drawn in this final chapter suggest a critical necessity to reassess the foundational principles and underlying assumptions of transition management.
although the principles outlined in chapter 1 of this volume have served as a strong basis for governance experiments in the past decade, they may not be entirely sufficient for all stages of transitions.
with researchers recognizing the chaotic nature, non-linearity, and structural uncertainties inherent in systemic changes, it is evident that more than just accommodating frontrunners and conducting experiments is required.
undoubtedly, the focal point of the class was the collaborative small group effort focused on crafting a prototype for an online course.

they were tasked with defining student engagement aspects, outlining content delivery methods, planning technology integration to meet course objectives, and ensuring the course website's design aligned seamlessly with user-friendliness and mirrored the course's content and teaching methods.
following closely after the events in the drc, a summit of the great lakes region convened in nairobi in mid-december 2006.
the summit gathered 11 heads of state and government to endorse a significant regional agreement focusing on peace, security, and development.
the pact's key objectives include the disarmament of rebel groups, the establishment of a non-aggression and mutual defense agreement among regional leaders, and the implementation of various governance, humanitarian, and economic initiatives.
notably, the conference resulted in governments pledging to assume the responsibility of safeguarding their populations against genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity, and severe human rights violations occurring within or by a state.
a major obstacle to achieving justice and reconciliation through the gacaca trials is the persistent intimidation faced by genocide survivors and witnesses.
some individuals have resorted to extreme measures such as burning down the homes of witnesses, physically assaulting them, and even resorting to murder in an effort to destroy crucial evidence.
an alarming incident took place in gikongoro in december 2003, prompting the senate to establish an ad hoc commission to investigate these atrocities prior to the commencement of the gacaca trials.
the killing methods employed mirrored those of the genocide, raising concerns about the potential threat this posed to the upcoming gacaca courts set to begin the following year.
since the gacaca trials commenced in march 2005, there have been intermittent reports of witness and survivor murders.
it appears that as the momentum of the gacaca process grows, the frequency of these violent acts is also on the rise.
it is evident that these challenges are hindering the attainment of justice, leading to the frightening acts of intimidation and violence against survivors and witnesses in an effort to cover up evidence against the guilty parties.
if this pattern persists, the pursuit of justice may give way to fear of retaliation and a fight for mere survival, hindering the effectiveness of the gacaca process.
despite its considerable hurdles, this process remains rwanda's best chance to tackle the cycle of violence that has caused immense suffering and destruction in society.
in eritrea, despite initially gaining independence following the war, female heroes and iconic women soon found their newfound freedom compromised.
conversely, in rwanda, while occasional instances of resistance persist, the government has recognized and celebrated the remarkable strength and endurance displayed by women who courageously shouldered the hardships of the genocide.
these women have demonstrated boldness and unwavering resolve in rebuilding their families, communities, and nation.
consequently, the government has implemented measures to safeguard the advances made for women during this challenging period.

a chatbot is specialized software designed to interact with people in a conversational manner.
many chatbots connect with various messaging platforms to engage with users, while others operate independently as standalone applications.
there are two main types of chatbots based on how they process input and generate responses.
certain chatbots operate by handling user queries as directives, utilizing predefined commands or rules set during their creation.
they respond to users by examining incoming queries based on these established rules and providing relevant information in return.
even though these robots work fast and effectively, they are not capable of understanding casual language questions.
as a result, they are limited in their ability to engage in in-depth discussions with humans.
chatbots powered by nlp algorithms analyze keywords extracted from predefined libraries to facilitate communication.
the effectiveness of this interaction relies on the quality of these libraries and the underlying chatbot software.
indeed, the majority of chatbots operate using three distinct classification methods that enhance their underlying structure.
however, algorithms play a crucial role in helping the program obtain answers for queries that don't fit into established patterns.
they achieve this by simplifying classifiers and establishing a structured framework.
entity: an entity is the fundamental concept of a chatbot that a business selects.
for example, a chatbot designed for an online store might incorporate entities such as payment systems or order tracking systems.
dependency parsing: the system examines the text to identify nouns, verbs, subjects, objects, and phrases in order to detect information that is dependent on the user's input.
once the purpose is determined, the chatbot accesses the database to retrieve information needed for its reply.
the knowledge base acts as the central hub for providing information regarding products, services, or the company.
it contains responses to frequently asked questions, instructional guides, and any other relevant information that customers may want to access.
another important element of a chatbot structure is the database storage integrated into the platform during its creation.
this database is responsible for storing all chat logs and analytical data.
the basic workflow and structure of a chatbot program generally remain consistent, whether the architecture is simple or complex.
complexity typically arises when extra components are added to enhance the bot's ability to communicate naturally.
the diagram below shows the basic structure of a chatbot system and how it handles user requests.
the flowchart below illustrates the process through which a chatbot's nlu engine analyzes a query and retrieves a suitable response.
chatbots can be easily integrated with different texting platforms.
you can select a communication channel based on your business requirements, customer accessibility, and the availability of the necessary api for your chosen chatbot.
for example, you have the option to create a chatbot for your business website or mobile application.
similarly, you can connect your chatbot with various platforms such as facebook messenger, skype, other messaging apps, and even sms services.
taking into account the needs of your business and the volume of customer inquiries, it is important to tailor the chatbot's dialogue.
a basic chatbot can effectively offer quick support to customers by using straightforward faq-style responses.
it is essential to create a conversational approach that addresses a wide range of potential customer questions.
the last stage in developing a chatbot involves creating classifiers to map out the dialogue flow.
these classifiers help the chatbot understand and respond to user queries by analyzing context, fetching responses, and generating suitable replies based on the conversational structure.
irrespective of the development method used, the effectiveness of the dialogue flow is crucial for a seamless conversation with users.
before deciding to invest in a development platform, it is important to assess its suitability for your business based on the following factors.
the amount of time needed to successfully develop and deploy a chatbot can fluctuate depending on the process involved.
for example, using online platforms that provide pre-built chatbots allows you to have a chatbot up and running in under an hour.
these platforms enable you to select a chatbot that best fits your industry, customize its dialogue, and quickly implement it for use.
similarly, creating a chatbot using self-service tools like chatfuel can be time-consuming.
customizing your chatbot on these platforms may require several hours to a few days for deployment, varying based on the complexity of the setup.
connecting the chatbot to a single chat platform may require 40-56 hours depending on the level of complexity.
designing a command language ui typically requires 40-56 hours, while building a chatbot with a natural language ui could take approximately 120-160 hours.
customizing business logic: if you are incorporating business logic into your websites or mobile apps using an existing api, it typically requires around 120-160 hours.
however, if you are starting from square one and developing the business logic entirely by yourself, the process may take closer to 192 hours.
however, when opting to create a chatbot through a software development company, the process typically requires a longer timeframe.
specifically, it can take approximately 4 to 6 weeks to develop and launch a tailored chatbot successfully.
originally seen as a special feature for businesses, chatbots have now become essential for success.
they play a crucial role in maintaining customer satisfaction through ongoing support.
additionally, they assist employees with various tasks, leading to improved efficiency.
chatbots offer advantages to companies of all sizes, whether they are large-scale, mid-level, or startup.
success in terms of increased sales, revenue, and customer base can be achieved by developing a chatbot tailored to the company's needs, easily maintained, and adaptable to changing business requirements.
by investing in chatbots, companies can increase their chances of growth and enhance their appeal to customers.
setting goals with consciousness involves reflecting on past experiences and future aspirations, considering personal definitions of success, learning from past lessons, and identifying areas for improvement.
the next step in setting conscious goals is to write down your new year's goals with purpose.
you can do this in a journal, collaborate with a group of women to make vision boards, or create a digital vision board where you select the ideas and items you wish to manifest in your life.
platforms like canva or pinterest can assist you in compiling inspiring images and words.
limiting beliefs are inaccurate thoughts, typically received from family or society, that hinder us from achieving our objectives and realizing our complete capabilities.
you might have consciously adopted notions, such as never being able to make a substantial income or being undeserving of advancement.
these beliefs can act as obstacles when pursuing your conscious goals.
this is why setting goals consciously has its limitations, and we highly suggest making a physical vision board using paper instead of a digital version.
a digital vision board can double as a to-do list for items you can act on immediately.
by evaluating your desires and selecting corresponding images or words, you make your goals more tangible.
practicing intuitive visualization and making a tangible vision board can help you overcome your limiting beliefs and connect with guidance from your subconscious and intuition.
by involving the universe in your aspirations, you tap into its wisdom as we are all connected to it.
often, we spend our time suppressing these messages and allowing our logical mind to rule.
embracing this practice gives you the opportunity to release some of that control that might be hindering you from achieving your genuine aspirations.
physical vision boards are tangible and provide a hands-on experience, making them feel more concrete and present in your life.
you can place them in prominent locations like your desk or bedroom door to serve as a daily reminder and inspiration.
take one magazine and look through it page by page.
tear out any images or words that catch your eye and put them off to the side.
sort through your magazines and gather a collection of images and cutouts.
begin arranging them on the board by selecting the ones you like and adhering them with the help of scissors.
currently, there are numerous online articles about copywriting that can benefit newcomers to the field.
additionally, these resources are valuable for experienced professionals as they offer a wealth of new information and insights into evolving industry standards worldwide.
firstly, it is important to note that there are various specializations within the field of copywriting.
some focus on technical innovations, others on educational content, while another group may specialize in writing about cosmetics, among other topics.
however, certain resources can benefit any copywriter by providing general guidelines on managing their work effectively and helping them avoid certain pitfalls.
if an employee is interested in pursuing business copywriting, it is beneficial to gain skills in developing marketing plans, creating csi reports, and other commonly used documents.
the internet offers a plethora of excellent resources that showcase exemplary copywriting samples.
there is a job known as a travel copywriter, where individuals travel and write blog articles to make a living while exploring the world.
alternatively, there are professionals in this field who work for airlines or travel agencies.
these employees choose to read a variety of professional and classical materials in order to enhance their skills.
it is worth noting that becoming a creative professional is more challenging than becoming merely a skilled content writer.
another important aspect to keep in mind when seeking employment is having experience in copywriting.
many individuals are drawn to this field due to its competitive salaries and favorable work environments.
nevertheless, they must adhere to specific standards set by contemporary businesses in order to support their financial success.
it is clear that all candidates need to have a good understanding of fundamental copywriting principles.
they are also required to practice their skills regularly through copywriting exercises on a weekly basis.
while there is an abundance of copywriting services accessible online and offline, not all deliver top-notch work.
it is important for individuals to identify providers who can fully accommodate their instructions and requirements without constraints.
in order to produce compelling and successful advertisements that resonate with consumers and influence their product choices, it is essential to educate oneself on the relevant subject matter.
a thorough understanding of marketing is crucial for aspiring advertising copywriters to thrive in their field.
however, it is possible to create good content even without expertise in the relevant industry.
a helpful article on a specialized website provides valuable insights for copywriters on how to create trustworthy and top-notch marketing content.
it is common knowledge that an online shopping copywriter influences people to make purchases over the internet.
it is worth noting that the practice of online commerce has grown significantly in the past ten years.
individuals carefully review product descriptions and guides in order to find the best deals.
unfortunately, it seems that some writers provide inaccurate information about electronic devices and other technical products they are discussing.
in summary, it is appropriate to say that copywriting is a challenging task that requires individuals to continuously improve and refine their professional abilities.
it is beneficial for people to acquire copywriting skills prior to entering the workforce in order to save time on further education.
clients seem to have more faith in experts who specialize in specific fields rather than general writers because of their in-depth understanding of professional terminology and other critical aspects.
regrettably, one out of every two documents found online contains plagiarized content, so copywriters must be careful to avoid copying when creating articles on the same subjects.
being a professional in copywriting does not mean creating entirely new material.
instead, employees need to be able to collect reliable information, extract the key points, and synthesize those ideas into a unique document that will provide specific advantages to its audience.
typically, copywriting is considered a straightforward task for individuals with expertise or experience in a particular area.
they should focus solely on subjects they know well.
additionally, effective copywriters should have a refined writing style to captivate their audience.
recent studies indicate that 50% of americans are not organized, and 20% of tasks are not completed on time.
if you find yourself in this situation, would you like to learn how to better manage missed deadlines and improve your organization skills?
keep in mind a few basic guidelines that can assist you in setting deadlines and ensuring timely completion of tasks, enabling you to work effectively whether you work independently or within a larger group.
once you take responsibility for missing the deadline, you can pinpoint the errors that led to it and prevent them from occurring again in the future.
if you identify any of the errors mentioned above, make an effort to prevent them from happening again in the future.
mastering the skill of handling missed deadlines starts with the initial steps taken for a task.
this involves creating a detailed action plan that serves as the basis for managing all future assignments and projects.
it is important to be flexible with your plans and make adjustments as needed, especially when dealing with missed deadlines.
for instance, using automated reminders may not be effective for urgent projects, while setting smart goals is consistently reliable for meeting deadlines.
now that you are familiar with managing a missed deadline, take the necessary time to create a plan that is tailored to your work environment and the tasks assigned to you.
it is important to keep in mind that the tips provided are not one-size-fits-all solutions for success.
instead, customize and adjust them to create a personalized strategy that will enhance your productivity.
when discussing mental health in the workplace, many managers struggle to effectively communicate and address the topic with their employees.
they often feel uncertain and lacking in confidence about the appropriate ways to handle such conversations.
instead, our decision was to offer personalized sessions to our two clients, allowing me to address their unique needs and tailor the content accordingly.
these sessions combined aspects of coaching with the sharing of tools and techniques relevant to their development goals.
the clients also had the flexibility to choose different session lengths, with one opting for a single 2-hour session and the other selecting two 1-hour sessions scheduled a month apart.
although both clients signed up for the same workshop on workplace credibility, it was notable that their needs differed significantly.
during individual coaching sessions, i helped them identify the root of their challenges and then introduced distinct models that they could implement in their specific situations.
one individual focused on learning to express their true desires and overcoming their tendency to please others, while the other concentrated on establishing a dialogue that is emotionally secure.
we want our clients to know that we are receptive to new ideas and open to alternative approaches.
as a result, we have included this learning option in our offerings to inspire individuals to explore it at the beginning of the year.
his message conveyed a sense of joy and festivity, which highlights the significance of exploring our identity, culture, and how they impact our behavior.
this work is deemed crucial and meaningful.
releasing these beliefs and intentions allows for more meaningful connections and solid relationships.
it is also essential for constructive dialogues.
not long after meeting this colleague, i participated in a workshop about cross-cultural communication where i discovered that in her culture, people tend to use emotional expression and directness in their communication.
i realized that being emotionally reserved could be seen as impolite or distant in her culture.
this insight was enlightening, and it prompted me to reflect on my own communication style and cultural background.
i found ways to communicate effectively with her and others without feeling judged.
if you want to know more about effective ways of communicating with people from diverse backgrounds, happy provides a great workshop called communicating across differences: equality, diversity and inclusion in the workplace.
this workshop is designed to address these challenges and offer advice on how to improve communication.
the covid-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of organizations becoming more resilient.
one proven way to enhance resilience is by aligning with the urgent societal and global challenges of today.
forward-thinking companies achieve this by leveraging their core strengths to address these challenges, leading to the creation of new business models and revenue sources.
this shift in mindset requires organizations to go beyond serving only shareholders and stakeholders, and instead focus on generating value that addresses larger societal and environmental issues.
the key question then becomes: how can your organization, with its existing competencies, resources, and capabilities, contribute to tackling the significant societal and environmental problems that exist today?
i started to have doubts about my assumptions regarding my role in relationships and reevaluated what i had sacrificed and how i had disadvantaged others by adhering to a certain pattern.
i remembered feeling resentment when neglecting my own needs to avoid conflicts or maintain the status quo in relationships, which eventually led to their deterioration.
it's possible that this resentment was palpable to others, making the relationships superficial and unfulfilling because i didn't communicate my emotions and needs.
it could be that my constant yielding also caused my fatigue and anger, leading to the breakdown of relationships over time.
i recognized that my actions could be seen as self-righteous and belittling to others, prompting me to realize the need for change.
in keeping with the theme of ongoing genuine communication started in my previous blog post, i want to discuss my thoughts on the most important skill that i found to be crucial in the last two months: the ability to listen.
paying attention to both my own thoughts and the thoughts of others has been augmented by my newfound focus on actively listening to the environment around me in both urban areas and natural settings.
this heightened form of listening is helping me to slow down, become more centered, and establish an immediate profound connection to the fundamental energy that binds us all together, which is evident through its vibrations and pulses if we are attentive enough to perceive it.
developing superpowers requires courage as it involves recognizing and understanding how our strengths, when pushed too far, can become limitations.
an illustration of this is the author's pride in their convictions and values, which may morph into close-mindedness and rigidity if taken to extremes.
to enhance our abilities, we need to acknowledge the adverse aspects of our strengths and be prepared to refine how we wield them to prevent undermining our effectiveness.
some individuals who do not hold official leadership roles may feel discouraged from pursuing personal growth and development.
they may mistakenly believe that only those in high-ranking positions, such as elected officials or ceos, have the capacity to create significant change.
it is important to challenge this mindset and recognize that leadership goes beyond formal titles.
it is essential to avoid feeling like victims and understand that leadership does not always come with a designation.
instead of using the absence of a title as a reason for inaction, we should embrace the idea that everyone has the potential to lead and make a positive impact.
being a leader requires courage and a readiness to take risks.
it involves acknowledging and appreciating diverse viewpoints, working with others to address complex problems, balancing our strengths, and pursuing personal growth.
leaders must be prepared to learn continuously and face challenges with grace and bravery.
what sets change makers apart and makes them so influential?
what lessons can we derive from them?
how does resilience transform into a powerful attribute that, when combined with other strengths, becomes a formidable asset?
as i finalize my upcoming book that explores successful co-creation, i want to offer a valuable insight that could benefit you.
for me, possessing a superpower means being able to overcome a pair of opposing strengths to unlock extraordinary abilities and strength.
the transformation from weaknesses to abilities and from abilities to extraordinary powers is the journey of growth for the heroes known as change makers.
i believe you have combined your innate abilities with other talents to cultivate your unique personal superpowers.
i encourage you to review the strengths outlined in our research in figure 2 and reflect on where you stand regarding these strengths and the challenges they may pose.
consider the constraints you face when pushing a strength too far and use this insight to guide your path back to a balanced and impactful demonstration of that strength.
ceos and hr directors have consistently identified adaptability, authenticity, and values as essential leadership qualities for individuals across all levels of an organization.
these qualities are also crucial for building resilience.
resilience, in my view, refers to the ability to effectively respond to external challenges by quickly adjusting and recovering, ultimately establishing a new balance.
navigating networking at an event with exclusive access and encountering unexpected weather conditions proved to be a unique learning experience.
due to heavy snow and rain disrupting the schedule, improvising and assisting other attendees with tasks such as registration and queuing for badges turned out to be the most effective way to build connections.
the shared challenge of overcoming unexpected obstacles fostered a stronger bond among participants than a usual social gathering would.
in fact, one incident even led to potentially recruiting a new mba student to bsl.
the three key takeaways i gained at davos align well with what ceos believe are essential for resilience: being able to adapt, staying true to oneself, and upholding values.
i hope you find these reflections useful as you navigate your role in driving change within your organization and exploring new territories!
as i write this blog post, it is the end of 2017.
over the past year, my blogging colleague, katrin muff, and i have dedicated many discussions to corporate culture.
it is notable that the media has also shown a keen interest in this topic, with numerous articles on corporate culture making headlines in prominent newspapers and magazines.
to collect some examples of these stories, i quickly searched the web.
leaders have a significant impact on shaping the culture of an organization, yet they may not always be aware of all the implications of their decisions.
they can benefit from actively seeking feedback and insights from their employees to better understand the inner workings of the organization and make necessary adjustments to enhance the organizational culture.
thinking ahead to 2018, i ponder the potential for preventing disasters next year if leaders of all companies dedicated themselves to evaluating their organizational cultures.
most likely, they would discover a combination of strong points to enhance and weaknesses to rectify.
in certain instances, they might uncover signs of harmful elements that could lead to grave repercussions for their employees and organizations if not addressed.
let us collectively commit to being proactive in the coming year by eliminating the negative aspects of our cultures while bolstering the positive aspects.
in the previous session, ceos discussed pressing societal issues that concerned them and identified opportunities for integrating these issues into future business endeavors.
the highlighted challenges align with the key societal concerns identified by the gapframe in switzerland, including excessive co2 emissions, equal opportunities, sustainable consumption, social inclusion, and clean energy.
the audience was encouraged to reflect on these discussions and commit to taking a specific action within three days to address a gap between current conditions and desired outcomes in an area of personal importance.
an online tool was provided for participants interested in sharing their proposed actions.
i would have liked more time for the final reflection at the end, as it ended a minute earlier than expected when our 30 minutes were up.
however, i was pleased to see the personal commitments being shared.
i have grouped them into categories for a more organized review, as shown in figure 2.
a considerable amount of time is typically dedicated to work for many individuals in the united states, with estimates showing that adults spend around one-third of their time at their jobs.
this often exceeds the time spent on other activities like spending time with loved ones.
the focus is not on whether this is an ideal lifestyle, but rather on the significance of work in people's lives.
it prompts reflection on whether work is solely pursued for financial gain or if there are deeper meanings and motivations behind it.
from my personal discussions with employees, it is evident that a majority prefer to work for organizations that have a clear mission and defined principles.
support for this view comes from a study i mentioned in my blog last august, which revealed that employees of all age groups are seeking meaning in their professional activities, not just millennials.
given that we often see our identity tied to our job, it is common for us to desire our work to have significance.
each year, it is commonly reported that a significant number of employed individuals globally lack enthusiasm for their jobs and feel disconnected from their organizations and tasks.
this lack of engagement often leads to adverse effects on our physical and mental health.
motivation can be triggered by both external and internal sources.
it can stem from your surroundings as well as from your own inner drive.
when faced with challenging situations, the desire for improvement often spurs action and prompts individuals to take steps toward a better future.
observing successful individuals around you can provide valuable insights.
by identifying their disciplined habits, goals, and coping strategies, you can adopt these practices into your own routine.
don't hesitate to seek advice from them, as doing so can benefit you in countless ways in the long run.

maybe what you require is a change in surroundings.
redesign your living space in a manner that sparks creativity.
everything ultimately comes down to mindset.
having the correct mindset is crucial, even if you are skilled in planning and setting goals.
without the right mindset, your progress may be limited.
proactivity entails being proactive in the workplace by taking the initiative to fulfill your duties and responsibilities diligently.
discovering motivation in the workplace is closely associated with recognizing your own diligence.
being more proactive will increase the chances of your colleagues valuing your efforts.
the recognition and praise you receive can serve as a strong motivator to persist in your work.
avoid going to your workplace to criticize the system or environment.
refrain from complaining about your job and instead concentrate on what value you can bring.
by taking this action, you are drawing inspiration towards you.
you possess the motivation to contribute to the company's progress and are therefore willing to make the extra effort to achieve it.
if you desire growth, it is important to be receptive to feedback, especially when it is constructive.
constructive criticism can help us advance and can serve as a source of inspiration.

being isolated in your room can drain your creativity and lead to monotony.
therefore, it is advised to switch up your environment and spend time at a local cafe to appreciate its unique ambiance and surroundings.
taking a break and going on a vacation can be beneficial in sparking creativity.
whether you decide to relax on the beach or go camping, stepping away from your regular routine is important to let new ideas and inspiration flow.
i communicate it verbally or jot it down.
i prefer to write it down so that my children can reflect on it in the future, once i am gone, after completing the work i have accomplished.
this method promotes a shift in perspective and encourages you to concentrate on the present moment.
visit promptly journals to purchase gratitude books or self-love journals.
understanding yourself is essential before you can lead a fulfilling life and achieve your goals.
self-discovery is important because it helps you realize your incredible skills, talents, and abilities.
the only perspectives that should influence your life are what you believe in your heart and what god thinks about you.
it's important to understand that self-discovery is a process that can vary in length for different people.
while some may have a quick journey, others may take longer.
the beneficial part of self-discovery is that the insights gained can motivate you to pursue your goals and fulfill your true potential.
believing in yourself as a winner rather than a loser will lead to success.
your mindset plays a crucial role in determining the outcome.
a unhappy individual can be a powerful force and may try to influence others negatively if left unchecked.
you have the power to reject any negative energy that unhappy individuals may try to bring into your life.
instead, choose to be around individuals who will encourage and uplift you rather than those who consistently bring negativity into your life.
for something to be considered valuable, it is essential that individuals have confidence in its worth and its ability to retain value over time, ensuring that it can be redeemed in the future.
paper money became prominent in society for its practicality and convenience.
with macro-economic shifts over time, the connection between the paper currency and the gold backing it was severed.
a detailed explanation of the factors that caused us to move away from the gold standard could be quite intricate and go beyond the focus of this article.
however, the overall monetary worth of a government's assets remains constant.
you are essentially relinquishing full control of your finances to governments or central banks.
governments have the authority to freeze your account and prevent you from accessing your funds.
even if you solely rely on physical cash, like in the case of india a few years ago, the government may invalidate the legal status of the currency.
the whitepaper proposed a method for establishing a system for a decentralized cryptocurrency named bitcoin.
this system aimed to offer a solution to the issue of double-spending in digital currency without relying on a central entity.
laszlo posted in 2010 seeking to purchase 2 pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins.
a seller accepted the offer, and today the value of those pizzas exceeds 100 million dollars.
basically, if you wanted information, you could obtain it from prominent sources such as the new york times, the washington post, and other media outlets.
no governmental authority or financial institution can choose to enact a freeze on your account or seize your assets.
bitcoin reduces the need for intermediaries when transferring money.
these individuals do not have access to traditional banking services due to their geographic location or the socioeconomic circumstances they were born into.
there are also bitcoin debit cards available that enable you to make purchases at a wide range of stores using your bitcoin funds.
the evolution of currency started in 2009, and now we are witnessing its transformation of traditional financial systems.
avoid activities that hinder your progress towards your goals, such as excessive movie watching, spending too much time on social media, oversleeping, and associating with negative influences.
prioritize your goals in order of importance as a reference for setting and achieving them effectively.
living a healthy lifestyle offers numerous advantages for both the body and mind.
by adopting healthy habits, you can decrease the likelihood of developing various serious conditions such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and osteoporosis.
overall, there are several benefits to maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including improvements in social and personal well-being, enhanced family relationships, and a longer life expectancy compared to individuals who do not prioritize their health.
how to accomplish this: choose carefully which aspects of your life you are willing to compromise for your career.
while putting in extra effort to excel at work can be beneficial, it should never come at the expense of your personal relationships and social activities.
having experienced the pain of losing a loved one myself, i resonated with corina quinn's touching and optimistic writing about grief.
her piece highlighted the transformative power of travel, showing how it can help shift our outlook on life, even during the darkest times.
it emphasized the importance of not underestimating the healing potential that travel holds, bringing us back from the depths of despair.
while exploring armenia, i purposely changed my route to visit tatev, a monastery constructed on the edge of a cliff, accessible via a lengthy aerial tramway.
on that day, i dressed modestly by wearing loose pants covering my legs, a loose top with long sleeves, and a headscarf.
i followed the posted rules by keeping my camera and phone inside my purse.
to show respect for the worshipers, i chose to sit quietly at the back of the monastery.
meanwhile, other groups of local tourists were disruptive, taking photos with flashes, wearing revealing clothing like miniskirts, and behaving noisily.
i was incredibly surprised when a nun unexpectedly walked by and firmly slapped my arm.
feeling surprised, i quickly moved my legs out of her reach and unintentionally uncrossed them in the process.
it was revealed that the spider above me was a rain spider, and i had unknowingly been sitting under its nest.
the spider had emerged to greet me.
in the evening, i strolled through sky avenue in genting highlands enjoying a quick meal of instant noodles before catching the cable car back to kuala lumpur.
all of a sudden, i heard loud and uncontrollable laughter coming from behind a pillar near a subway kiosk.
curious, i moved closer to investigate, only to be shocked by the sight of a huge dinosaur charging around the corner, jaws snapping.
nevertheless, my heart started racing, and i felt a surge of instinct.
i quickly turned and ran, accidentally spilling the noodles i was eating all over the street.
strangely, i found myself unable to stop laughing.
a more contemporary impulse replaced the primal instinct.
the idea of capturing a selfie with the dinosaur seemed appealing.
despite the creature looming nearby with its mouth agape, as though ready to devour, i bravely posed for the selfie with a forced smile.
immediately upon hearing the camera shutter, i fled the scene without pausing to glance back.
we were on our honeymoon in the galapagos islands, enjoying a leisurely week sailing, snorkeling with sea lions, and encountering marine iguanas.
this marked the end of a month-long journey through peru and ecuador, and we felt reluctant to leave and return home.
when we reached the small, quaint airport and placed our backpacks on the scanner, chaos erupted.
a group of armed guards unexpectedly arrived and escorted hubbie away without offering any explanation.
panicked, i followed behind, believing there must have been a mistake.
however, as they led him behind a temporary partition, i noticed his bag discarded on the floor, encircled by suspicious officials.
despite the effort put into bringing it home, the salt remains untouched in our kitchen cupboard even after 13 years.
it serves as another memento that appeared promising at the moment of purchase.
i dedicated one year of my college education to malaysia, and to conclude my time there, i traveled with some friends to an island for a weekend getaway.
upon arriving at our seemingly empty apartment, my initial intention was to go to the bathroom.
to my shock, i discovered that we were not the only ones present.
when i opened the door, i was met with the surprising sight of a one-meter long monitor lizard leisurely hanging out on the toilet.
i went to the front desk and tried to clarify the situation.
their expressions were priceless when i signaled for them to follow me to the restroom.
the staff had a thorough conversation and contacted several people to join, each arriving with various tools and equipment.
the hotel staff instructed us that when she returned, we needed to quickly retrieve the lasso from the toilet and escort her to the reception area.
this seemed like a straightforward task that was just a standard part of the agreement between the hotel and its guests.
after spending roughly ten minutes in the water, i glanced back at the shore only to find a group of baboons going through my belongings eagerly, similar to a child exploring its first taste of jelly.
when i arrived at the scene of destruction where my possessions once were, there was barely anything remaining, including my clothing.
following the huge success of the korean drama boys over flowers in asia, my interest in macau was piqued.
given the opportunity for an all-expenses-paid vacation as a reward from my previous employer for successfully completing our most significant campaign to date, i decided to visit macau.
these were some of the thoughts i had in addition to considering cakes, photographers, and venues for our upcoming wedding.
all my thoughts vanished instantly when a coworker called out to me in distress, surrounded by intimidating individuals.
because of the difficulty in communicating due to different languages, he mistakenly perceived the situation as resistance.
consequently, he signaled to his team members to detain us.
the majority of the swat team members appeared confused and perplexed as they stood idle in their heavy protective gear.
they seemed to question the purpose of their presence, as they surrounded a group of young women in their twenties who appeared fragile and incapable of defending themselves.
it was evident that these women were not a threat, especially given the situation involving a growing crowd of about 30 people.
with a sense of safety and increased assurance, we accompanied them to the police station where we ended up being held for over 4 hours, causing us to come close to missing our flight back home.
on my birthday, january 8th, 2020, we aimed to travel from chefchaouen in morocco to fes.
we bought two tickets for a budget bus departing at 10am.
after being cheated by the baggage handler before, i didn't have any cash for the restroom.
i had to ask for change from another traveler and barely made it back to the bus on time.
i remain puzzled by the situation, as my official name is estella gold and the american airlines staff member used the name from my passport.
i returned to the same employee, who then issued an apology and provided me with a new ticket.
i inquired about reclaiming my initial position on the standby list and was denied.
a group of people had congregated around, and i recognized that there was no need to carry on with the discussion.
the situation was slightly uncomfortable as there was no privacy, and i had to request the group members to avert their eyes while i went to the bathroom.
wearing a wetsuit meant i had to completely undress to relieve myself.
as i was in the middle of something, i suddenly noticed a cruise ship approaching with around 50 people on board, peering over the side with cameras ready.
feeling embarrassed by the unwanted attention, my only reaction was to smile and wave awkwardly as eyes turned towards me.
i was staying in my camper van and accidentally left the window open at night.
upon my return, i discovered a large huntsman spider perched on the steering wheel.
these spiders, while not dangerous to humans, are remarkably big and have a striking appearance that can make even a great white shark seem adorable.
i was getting ready to spend the night camping by the car when the spider returned after a half hour.
with the help of a selfie stick, my boyfriend managed to guide the spider out of the car window and back into the outdoors of northern queensland.
it appeared to be a residential area, had an industrial smell, and had very few bus stops.
we were feeling extremely hot, had almost lost hope of making it through, and wished we had relied on google maps for directions.
ultimately, we opted for a taxi to portimao and spent the remainder of the day relaxing at the harbor and discovering the stunning praia da rocha beach.
the next day, we decided to catch the bus to lagos and sought guidance from the hotel receptionist to ensure we found our way.
we gathered essential items like cider, an inflatable bed, and a compact two-person tent, and set off on our journey.
upon reaching the camping site, we encountered strong winds that even a seasoned meteorologist like michael fish would have concerns about.
despite the challenging conditions, we, as experienced campers, were confident in our abilities and attempted to set up the tent.
after 20 minutes of struggling against the elements, the tent pole unfortunately broke in half.
we compensate for our lack of expertise by being determined, so we went to the nearby camping store to find a solution.
you mean those who are skilled and well-prepared campers with elaborate camping equipment.
the journey during which the solution was to drink a lot of cider each evening to distract ourselves from the fact that we were essentially camping.
the palace of versailles is famous for its lavish decorations, luxurious rooms, and the scandalous behavior of the french court.

review marketing is essential for the ongoing prosperity of all businesses.
customer reviews serve as important social evidence that potential customers rely on to make informed purchasing choices, drawing on the experiences of past customers.
a large number of reviews ultimately contribute to a summary rating that quickly indicates whether your brand is a good investment or if customers should instead choose a competing brand.
for numerous individuals, gathering a large number of customer reviews can be challenging, making the process of requesting reviews and developing an effective review marketing plan highly desirable.
in the long run, these favorable reviews can serve as valuable marketing resources that are free and effective in bolstering social proof and convincing people to buy from you.
before requesting feedback from customers, it's important to verify that your brand is listed and managed on popular review platforms.
apart from google and facebook, there are numerous other platforms for business reviews that you might consider listing on.
however, it is essential to conduct research to determine if these sites are valuable for your business, and in some instances, may require an investment.
by creating and regularly checking your listings, you can gain valuable insights into how your brand is perceived.
there are various strategies to request reviews, but they all share the common goal of making the review-writing and submission process simple.
in essence, the aim is to minimize any obstacles or steps necessary for leaving a review.
when giving a physical card to customers at checkout, it's important to use a short link in text rather than a long url.
similarly, when requesting reviews through sms, make sure the link leads directly to your online listing instead of providing instructions on how to leave a review step by step.
those who send review requests via email can enhance their approach by incorporating an attractive email image or design that also functions as a direct link for users to easily access the review platform.
for instance, gathering feedback from users on a particular update can be done using a tool such as beamer.
users can provide reactions to each announcement by using emoticons and also share detailed comments.
review management platforms such as reviewtrackers offer functionalities that enable users to quickly generate and personalize various templates for review requests, allowing for swift distribution to customers.
increasing the number of reviews requires showcasing your best current reviews in strategic places.
along with your listings, you can promote positive reviews on your social media platforms and business website.
before proceeding, it is important to consider general guidelines when it comes to displaying reviews.
is it possible to utilize the review to entice more individuals to experience a particular product or service?
if feasible, consider incorporating the user who provided the review as well.
individuals tend to appreciate attention, particularly when it originates from a brand they endorse and admire.
make sure to interact with individuals who are liking, sharing, and commenting on your post.
they could be potential customers looking for more information before deciding to buy from you.
engaging with people who interact with your posts is a good way to begin community management.
this can enhance your online reputation, build trust, and potentially increase the number of customers who will provide reviews for your business.
nevertheless, make sure to also explore other areas of your website that could potentially improve with input from customers.
displaying your top reviews within a specific star rating bracket can help demonstrate to customers why they should select your business instead of others, leading to quicker buying decisions and increased conversions.
yet, the true difficulty is in establishing a cycle where requests for reviews generate more reviews, ultimately drawing in additional customers who are also inclined to share their feedback.
the fundamental steps mentioned above are essential elements for that process.
by actively listening to customers, acting on their feedback, and interacting with them, you can enhance your brand's reputation and make it simpler to attract and keep loyal customers.
i have discovered that utilizing video tutorials is an effective method for educating my students, and using free tools has elevated my video production abilities.
this article will detail how to begin incorporating artistic and innovative elements into your video tutorial endeavors.
instructing individuals on video production can boost engagement in open source software communities.
allowing users to document their software usage facilitates knowledge sharing.
demonstrating basic screen capture techniques can simplify the process of submitting bug reports for open source software.
capturing the screen is commonly the initial step for producing materials such as software video tutorials, but obs is versatile for tutorials involving physical items like electronics or woodworking.
it can be utilized to record presentations and supports webcams, allowing for the combination of various webcam perspectives and screen captures.
furthermore, it is possible to integrate a presentation with a tutorial, where the presentation slides serve as a framework for the tutorial content.
this instance showcases a configuration comprising three scenes: one displaying the webcam, another showing a full desktop capture, and the third incorporating a display capture with a video inset from the webcam.
if your obs installation is new, you will notice a sole empty scene named "scene" at the bottom-left of the screen without any elements.
for those with a pre-existing obs setup, initiating a clean slate is possible by generating a fresh scene collection through the scene collection menu.
with the completion of the screen capture setup, you are ready to begin creating a simple software tutorial.
to start, click on start recording located in the lower-right corner under controls.
you can record the content you wish to demonstrate in your tutorial and utilize the scene selector to manage the source you are capturing.
transitioning between scenes in obs is akin to video editing cuts, but it occurs in real time during your tutorial session.
the real-time aspect of scene transitions in obs makes it a more efficient method compared to editing post-recording.
hence, it is advisable to conduct most of the scene transitions directly in obs.
after you have finished recording, click on the stop recording button.
to locate the video you just recorded, go to the file menu and choose the option for show recordings.
obs is a robust tool with various features beyond what was mentioned.
to further explore capabilities like adding text labels and streaming in real-time linux video editing using obs studio, refer to resources such as "how to livestream games like the pros with obs." for specific inquiries and technical support, the online obs user forum is a helpful resource.
if errors occur during screen capture or if you need to condense the video, you will have to make edits.
additionally, enhancing your video with artistic touches can make it more engaging.
injecting creativity can be an enjoyable process that plays a significant role in maintaining motivation in the long run.
b-roll footage is employed to construct shot sequences, similar to how software engineers create design patterns using individual statements, functions, and classes.
videographers use individual shots or clips to create shot sequences, boosting the quality and creativity of the video.
displaying images of oneself engaged in the activity can improve others' ability to envision themselves doing it.
studies on mirror neurons suggest they are activated when observing someone else's actions, particularly hand gestures.
the five-shot sequence is commonly employed by experienced video journalists, lending a sense of expertise to your video if utilized.
apart from capturing these five b-roll shots, you might consider filming a brief introduction to the video featuring yourself.
while this can be accomplished using obs and a webcam, using a smartphone camera offers flexibility in terms of angles and backgrounds.
a smartphone camera can be utilized to record b-roll footage for the five-shot sequence.
smartphones are widely available and their connectivity allows for easy transfer of video files to your editing software on a computer.
i utilize openshot, which is a video editing software that is open source.
similar to obs, it is developed using qt programming language, enabling it to be compatible with multiple operating systems.
a key element in openshot is the concept of tracks, which are composed of clips from various project files such as videos, audio, and images.
once you have uploaded the five clips to the project files section, move the first clip to the upper track by dragging and dropping it.
in this setup, the tracks act as layers, where the tracks with higher numbers are positioned in front of those with lower numbers.
therefore, the first clip should be placed on either track four or five.
it is recommended that each shot in the sequence of five shots lasts around two to three seconds.
if any shots are longer, you can remove the unwanted parts.
you have the ability to expand your capabilities with openshot transitions, and the comprehensive user guide is there to assist you in exploring the various options available.
in this demonstration, obs was utilized to record footage from two sources - the webcam and screen capture - using a single device, the computer.
if additional video sources, such as a separate camera, are involved, employing two concurrent tracks to blend the camera footage with the screen capture may be necessary.
alternatively, due to obs's ability to capture multiple sources simultaneously in real time, utilizing a second webcam instead of an external video camera could be a viable option.
by conducting all recording within obs and transitioning between scenes during the screen capture, the need for post-recording editing can be minimized.
your computer's built-in microphone may suffice for recording audio, which is a convenient and cost-effective choice.
however, if the quality is not up to standard, you might consider purchasing a separate microphone for better results.
one might assume that it is best to record without any background noise.
however, while this is ideal for music recording, capturing some ambient room noise can help to create consistency among clips recorded in various acoustic settings.
to achieve this, it is recommended to record approximately a minute of ambient sound in the location where you intend to record.
while you may not ultimately use this background noise, preparing a short audio snippet at the beginning can be beneficial if you expect to record in diverse environments.
audio compression is a method that can assist in addressing volume inconsistencies.
it works by decreasing the variation between quiet and loud sounds in audio files and can be set to avoid amplifying background noise.
audacity, a valuable open-source audio tool, incorporates compression features.
a clapper can be a useful tool when editing multiple audio recordings simultaneously.
the distinct peak in audio volume from the clapper can be utilized to synchronize different tracks by aligning the clapping noise and making it simpler to match up the various recordings.
estimating the time and effort needed to complete tasks and projects can be a challenging task due to various reasons.
however, there are some general guidelines that can assist in estimating the duration of a video production project.
initially, utilizing obs scene transitions during recording is more convenient compared to adding transitions in post-production.
implementing transitions while recording decreases the editing workload by eliminating the need to include them later.
as the volume of recorded content grows, the time and effort required tend to increase.
this is because recording more material is time-consuming and managing and editing a larger amount of content adds to the workload.
surprisingly, a shorter final project can actually require more time and effort compared to a longer one when starting with the same amount of raw material.
it is often more challenging to condense content into a shorter project than to work with a longer one, as constraints on the project's length can complicate the editing process.
it is crucial to protect and enhance mental well-being through suitable methods, given the significant impact it has on various aspects of one's life.
the subsequent elements outlined may impact emotional wellness and potentially raise the likelihood of experiencing mental health conditions.
experiencing physical assault, sexual violence, emotional abuse, or neglect during childhood can result in significant psychological and emotional suffering.
experiencing abuse raises the likelihood of developing mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and personality disorders.
your genetic composition may influence your overall health.
several mental health conditions have been identified to have a hereditary link and could be inherited within families.
regardless of age, mental health is crucial for overall well-being.
any deterioration in psychological well-being can lead to harmful behaviors that not only impact individual health but also damage relationships with others.
when mental and emotional well-being is strong, it becomes easier to face and overcome life's challenges.
one's mental well-being is closely tied to one's self-perception.
self-esteem is influenced by one's overall mental health, and confidence can serve as a strong indication of a positive mental state.
when you are mentally well, you are better equipped to offer your loved ones quality time, care, and assistance.
being in a positive emotional state allows you to be more present and supportive for those important to you.
coping with depression and other mental health conditions can have an effect on how productive you are.
when you are in a good mental state, you are more likely to work effectively and deliver better quality work.
improved mental health can lead to a better quality of life and increased engagement in community activities, such as volunteering at soup kitchens, food drives, shelters, and other initiatives.
another effective method for enhancing and sustaining mental health is seeking support from a mental health professional.
counseling can help individuals learn more constructive ways to engage with others and provide strategies for managing challenging situations.
therapy can assist individuals in identifying and addressing their negative behaviors, as well as equipping them with the necessary tools to implement positive changes in their lives.
your well-being can greatly influence every aspect of your life.
if you are struggling to manage your mental health alone, do not hesitate to reach out to a qualified therapist for support.
identifying which passenger characteristics are closely tied to the decrease in ridership is a crucial step in comprehending the reasons behind changes in behavior.
if certain demographic groups are experiencing a higher rate of ridership loss, it enables the identification of factors causing this behavioral shift.
conversely, if the decline is spread across all groups, there may be a generalized factor at play.
by making this distinction, transit agencies can predict future trends in bus ridership and devise strategies to counteract the decline.
this might involve enticing lost riders back through enhanced services or targeting alternative lucrative market segments.
this study has three key contributions.
the first is to confirm findings from previous studies on the socio-demographic factors linked to bus ridership at a specific time.
the second, which is the most significant, is to analyze changes in travel behavior among different socio-demographic groups to better comprehend the current decline in ridership.
the focus is on investigating how certain factors such as race, vehicle ownership, and education, which are associated with high ridership at a given moment, influence the changes in ridership over time.
the third contribution is to assess how socio-demographic factors related to bus services have evolved over time and whether local urban migration could be a factor in the decline in ridership.
to understand the relationship between the drop in national bus ridership and shifting demographics, it is crucial to quantify the extent of this trend.
table 5 presents the network-wide shifts in the proportion of white residents.
the initial row displays the percentage change in white residents across the complete service region.
individuals relocating from transit-centric areas to suburban locales may remain near a bus stop, but are less inclined to utilize it.
to account for the time factor in transit accessibility, the subsequent row of table 5 demonstrates variations in the percentage of white residents across the network, weighted by the frequency of service at adjacent segments.
essentially, individuals residing near high-frequency routes have a more significant impact on the calculation than those in areas with limited service.
there has been a shift in demographics in portland and minneapolis with a decrease in the white population but an increase in miami and atlanta.
in portland and minneapolis, the decrease in the white population is more pronounced in areas with limited services.
in atlanta, the overall increase in white residents is balanced by a decrease in service-rich areas.
when considering frequency, there is an overall decrease in the white population.
miami stands out as the only city where areas with bus service have seen an increase in white residents.
the rise in telecommuting and use of ridehailing services is happening at the same time as a decrease in ridership, particularly in miami and atlanta, across various neighborhoods and socio-demographic groups.
in minneapolis, however, while the decline in ridership is linked to the percentage of white residents and the increase is tied to the number of college-educated residents, these factors may not be the primary reasons behind the changes.
the authors express their sincere appreciation to the staff members of trimet, miami-dade transit, metro transit, and marta for providing data and insights regarding their transit systems.
special thanks are extended to individuals such as nathan banks of trimet, eric lind, janet hopper, john levin of metro transit, esther frometa-spring of miami-dade transit, and nazma akhter, lekha mukherjee, ivelisse matos, robert goodwin of marta.
additionally, gratitude is extended to rashad strickland of clever devices and thomas kowalsky of urban transportation associates for their assistance in interpreting the data and technology.
economists are becoming more interested in incorporating text data into their economic research.
the fgf demonstrates how online data can be used to develop a welfare measure that is not reliant on market-based economic indicators like gdp.
in informal online content, users express their feelings in a manner similar to how consumer demand theory explains revealed preferences.
examining online media content has more benefits compared to traditional methods like surveys when evaluating sentiments or well-being.
real-time analysis is possible with online media, avoiding delays inherent in survey methods.
moreover, conducting online media analysis is much more cost-effective.
the fgf monitors and tracks the real-time sentiment of the greater london population by analyzing social media, specifically focusing on twitter.
the national accounts were created in the 1930s to address the urgent demand from policymakers for information on output trends.
at the time, there was a noticeable decline in output across numerous economies, but a consistent method for measuring output in market-based economies was lacking.
thus, the primary objective behind establishing the gdp measurement was to accurately track and understand economic output.
these sets of data may or may not be helpful for comprehending or forecasting data in the conventional national accounts.
however, the primary focus should not be on their utility in this regard.
rather, they provide extra information beyond what is found in the national accounts.
section 2 introduces the fundamental principles of our strategy.
section 3 explains the process of converting text into numerical data for machine learning classification analysis.
section 4 discusses selecting machine learning algorithms.
section 5 presents the technical findings.
section 6 illustrates the london feel good factor results and provides a brief discussion on this topic.
to begin with, it is important to note that our method of estimating sentiment in greater london is not considered to be entirely conclusive.
it is evident that subjective judgment is needed at various critical junctures.
our findings demonstrate the type of measurement that can be conducted using information from text sources.
similar to national accounts, there will be a gradual agreement on the methods used in the process over time.
examining text on social media provides three clear benefits compared to traditional methods.
one benefit is based on economic theory, which relies on revealed preference to understand behavior.
actions taken by individuals better reflect their preferences than opinions provided in surveys or hypothetical scenarios.
similarly, social media discussions also reveal emotions and attitudes of individuals in a more direct way.
secondly, it can be conducted instantly instead of the delays associated with traditional survey methods.
significant effort has been dedicated to using traditional survey methods to make sure the sample mirrors the socio-economic diversity of the population.
however, this is currently not the situation with twitter.
despite their perceived complexity, survey methods may not always be successful in achieving their goals.
one common issue is the underestimation of support for right-wing parties in election polls, prompting survey companies to work on correcting this bias.
additionally, over time, social media platforms like twitter might become more reflective of the overall socio-economic diversity of the population.
evidence indicates that emotions and attitudes expressed on twitter may serve as an impartial reflection of the general population.
conventional socio-economic categorizations of samples may not be applicable in this context.
during the 2017 general election, we conducted a real-time study for a business client and discovered that the main political parties' share of the vote was expected to increase significantly, after years of decline.
our study revealed that online discussions primarily focused on brexit, contrary to mainstream media reports.
these findings were unexpected, as many analysts were surprised when the british election survey later confirmed that brexit was a central topic.
furthermore, in the final days of the election campaign, social media analysis suggested a slight decrease in support for the conservative party, which was not reflected in traditional survey polls.
these tweets cover a variety of topics such as football, holidays, work, and daily routines.
no filtering is done on the content of the tweets, as the goal is to capture a general overview of well-being.
this approach allows for a broad assessment but can also be tailored to focus on specific themes by curating tweets accordingly.
the algorithm does not just tally certain words from a predetermined list with emotions determined separately from the text.
instead, it directly learns the emotion from the text, as explained in the following section.
there are multiple ways to create this dataset, with this method focusing on using emojis found in tweets.
approximately 20% of tweets in greater london include emojis, resulting in about 13 million emoji-containing tweets from june 15, 2016, to the end of 2019.
to train the classifier, a subset of 10,000 positive tweets and 10,000 negative tweets from the dataset is randomly selected.
various sample sizes were tested, and findings indicate that once the sample size exceeds a few thousand for each category, the results remain consistent and unaffected by the sample size.
we do not include tweets that contain the emoji .
analysis of emoji clustering shows that this particular emoji is frequently used on its own.
after examining a small set of tweets with this emoji, it was found to be used in positive and negative contexts.
after choosing the tweets, we remove the emojis used for categorization.
this strategy compels the machine learning classifiers to evaluate the emotional tone of the tweets based solely on the text content.
certainly, alternative emojis can be employed.
tech companies like apple continue to introduce new emojis to represent a range of feelings.
emojis are becoming a crucial form of communication online.
the emojis we have chosen appear to be a suitable initial selection for our purposes.
we conducted a small study to determine the effectiveness of a machine learning analysis on tweets.
we randomly chose 50 positive and 50 negative tweets from london's twitter population, utilizing emojis to classify their sentiment.
next, we rearranged the tweets and inserted them into an excel spreadsheet.
once more, we removed all emojis, retaining only the tweet text.
we distributed the document to 11 staff members from a consulting firm in london and requested them to indicate if the tweets were positive or negative by assigning a 1 or 0 to each tweet based solely on the text.
everyone in the group works in london and is well-versed in the city's social and cultural landscape.
with the exception of one individual, all members have backgrounds in economics or psychology.
the majority of the group are in their twenties and are therefore proficient in using online media platforms.
it is likely that this specific group would excel at evaluating the emotional tone of a tweet compared to a randomly selected sample from the uk population.
additionally, the tweets provided contain emojis, indicating that they likely convey specific emotional content.
it would be more challenging to categorize a random sample of tweets from the entire population, rather than those with emojis.
we compiled the responses of 11 individuals for the 100 tweets.
tweets scoring 0, 1, or 2 were considered negative, while those scoring 9, 10, or 11 were considered positive.
we found 82 tweets falling into these clear categories, while the remaining 18 fell in the mid-range scores of 3 to 8, evenly distributed.
this indicates that in 18% of the tweets, there was disagreement among humans on the emotional tone being positive or negative.
in this part, we focus on transforming the text in tweets into a numerical format for analysis using common machine learning techniques.
we employ standard methods utilized in machine learning for this purpose.
the writers compile an extensive collection of words from various sources like twitter, wikipedia, and a web-crawling site.
they create a co-occurrence matrix that indicates the frequency of word pairs appearing together in the corpus.
we also explore a modified version of the glove approach.
it is important to note that the english word dataset used by glove may primarily consist of material from the united states and american english in a broader sense.
our goal is to create a live monitor that tracks the emotions conveyed in tweets from greater london, with the majority of the tweets expected to be in british english.
although the content of these tweets covers a broad range of topics, there is likely a focus on issues specific to londoners rather than global issues.
it is important to note that while there will be tweets from tourists in london, the resident population of the city is close to 9 million.
in this part, we discuss the algorithms to be utilized for categorizing tweets into either positive or negative groups.
to train a model based on an ensemble of decision trees, multiple trees are generated during training by selecting random subsets of data points with replacement.
each tree is created by randomly choosing a small set of features to split on at each node and determining the best split based on these features in the training data.
the predictions from the individual trees are then averaged.
this approach aims to strike a balance between bias and variance by combining many trees trained on different subsets of data, each with high variance but low bias.
this ensemble method helps reduce overall variance without significantly increasing bias.
a way to determine the confidence of a specific classification is to calculate the percentage of trees that classify the observation as the most frequent class.
the machine learning community values out-of-sample performance, which is similar to what econometricians call predicting results outside of the data used for training.
in section 2, the algorithms were trained using 10,000 tweets randomly chosen from those with positive emojis and another 10,000 tweets randomly chosen from those with negative emojis.
the outcomes described below are all derived from the performance of the models when tested outside of the original sample.
there is a vast array of options to consider when deciding on a model for the validation step discussed in the previous paragraph.
these include selecting the algorithm, choosing the hyperparameters for the algorithm, deciding between glove and word2vec word vector representations, and determining the dimension of the word vectors.
at first, we compared the effectiveness of the glove and word2vec methods and explored the optimal size of the word vectors for future analysis.
we evaluate the performance of different machine learning models, such as random forest, linear support vector machine (svm), and radial basis function svm, in python using default hyperparameter values.
we utilize the appropriate functions from the scikit-learn python package, specifically linearsvc for training and evaluating linear svm, svc for svm with rbf kernel, and randomforestclassifier for random forests.
we provide the accuracy rate of correctly classified tweets by averaging the out-of-sample performance in 10 separate data folds and calculating the variance of this value across the folds.
the average accuracy calculates the percentage of accurately classified tweets by computing the results from each fold of the 10-fold process.
the standard deviation of accuracy measures the variation in accuracy across the 10 different folds.
next, we proceeded to analyze how varying the values of the hyperparameters of the algorithms would impact the word2vec dataset containing 200 dimensions.
the initial stage involved analyzing the outcomes utilizing random forests and linear svms.
the findings from this analysis are presented in tables 2a and 2b.
these findings indicate that the sampling method has minimal impact on the results, whereas increasing the number of trees and depth enhances the accuracy of classification.
the outcomes achieved using the linear svm method appear to be somewhat superior to those produced by the random forest.
in the left table, we have the support vector machine (svm), while the right table displays the random forest model.
the svm shows a slightly higher accuracy in terms of correct classifications.
additionally, error distribution is more evenly spread in the svm results, whereas the random forest tends to misclassify positive tweets as negative more frequently.
as a result, the svm model was selected for the validation phase.
the confusion matrix in table 4 illustrates the model's performance when analyzing a new dataset comprising 10,000 positive and 10,000 negative tweets.
the power spectrum indicates significant values at extremely low frequencies, indicating the presence of seasonal patterns every three or six months.
however, due to the limited two and a half years of data available, the precise nature of these patterns cannot be conclusively determined.
the series demonstrates notable differences, but it can be validated through various common-sense checks.
for instance, every year during the christmas and new year period, there are significant shifts.
it shows an increase on december 24th and 25th, followed by a sharp decline on december 26th.
there are additional peaks on december 31st and january 1st, then a drop on january 2nd and 3rd.
on november 9, 2016, a significant downturn occurred when liberal london realized that president trump would be elected instead of president clinton.
starting from the spring of 2019, there has been a clear downward trend in the series, mirroring the pessimism felt in london about remaining in the european union as brexit draws near.
we are not implying that the series is a perfect indicator of london's economic future.
nevertheless, it does offer policymakers valuable real-time data that was previously unavailable.
for instance, the uk treasury had forecasted a rapid recession in late 2016 if britain opted to leave the eu in the june brexit referendum.
however, the fgf data indicated that there were no indications of a negative shift in attitudes in london.
in fact, it suggested that the population appeared to be more satisfied after the brexit vote.
it is mere conjecture, but politicians may potentially view series like this as more valuable than the highly esteemed national gdp.
while changes in economic output impact the well-being of the public, the sentiments and emotions of the voters could hold more significance for elected officials.

internet finance is a modern financial concept that has experienced rapid growth compared to other financial innovations in recent times.
unlike traditional finance, internet finance is not just a combination of traditional financial institutions and the internet, but is predominantly led by internet companies.
this type of financial innovation focuses on technology firms utilizing information technology to enhance the effectiveness and structure of financial services like financing, investment, and payment systems.
the entire internet industry uses this distinctive approach to bolster its position through ongoing funding and acquiring companies.
this model emphasizes that value is generated not just by creators, but also by customers and others in their value creation network.
by strategically investing and acquiring diverse businesses, a company in the internet sector can gain customers, expand its reach, and enhance its services, reinforcing its presence in the digital economy.
from this point of view, competitive advantages can be gained through various means, including resource availability and user engagement.
this idea has resulted in a high number of acquisitions and investments within the internet sector.
currently, there is limited literature available on the model, risks, or features of internet finance in significant economic systems.
this article aims to explore fluctuations in risks by analyzing disruptions in corporate value.
we recognize that certain internet companies possess strong risk management abilities, allowing them to effectively manage and navigate through risks as they establish their presence in the digital economy.
however, when attempting to assess risk using a risk mass perspective, there is a likelihood of distortion.
to address these issues, we have established several new comparative tests.
these include comparing internet financial companies with other internet firms, comparing internet technology companies with diverse operations, and evaluating overall market performance and corporate stock values.
we consider the local connection of risks, understand the transition from scale modification to extracting characteristics, and identify features with overlapping risk cycles.
it has been discovered that the quantity of risk does not always provide an accurate measure of risk for internet technology firms.
while a high risk volume may indicate a crisis within the company, some firms with elevated risk indicators continue to lead in terms of longevity, market value, and user base within the internet technology sector.
this showcases the interplay between ecological value and risk.
our findings indicate that companies with high-risk values may not experience the most significant fluctuations in risk.
while risk value merely communicates the extent of risk, fluctuations in risk can indicate shifts in investor sentiment over a specific timeframe, particularly useful for internet companies.
this data offers internet technology firms insights into their risk standing within the sector, while regulators can use it to monitor industry-wide risk trends promptly to address potential issues effectively.
based on our analysis of the correlation test, we observed that market factors significantly impact the correlation of risks.
we noted that companies operating in the us market exhibit a level of risk fluctuation similarity, while those in the chinese market demonstrate different types of similarities.
overall, the findings underline the challenge of separating the interrelated risk volatility within the internet industry, which displays periodic overlaps.
in practical market scenarios, there are instances where a single company specializes in a specific sector, while others engage in multiple sectors.
internet companies are expanding into financial services, and traditional financial institutions are utilizing online technology to stay competitive.
while official financial entities operate with licenses, there are also unregulated "shadow banks" in the market.
internet financial institutions employ a marketing tactic called two-way subsidies to encourage offline merchants to adopt mobile payment features.
additionally, online financial institutions have introduced the feature of making payments in multiple currencies across countries and have launched mobile payment services in both domestic and international consumer markets.
furthermore, the integration of online financial institutions and individual credit assessment is crucial in establishing a credit consumption mechanism.
by leveraging artificial intelligence and extensive data analysis, the aim is to enhance the online payment infrastructure through the credit system.
this will offer a technical foundation for microfinance and credit transactions.
p2p lending is an online financial platform established by internet companies that offers services for matching users who need financing or investment opportunities.
another trend is the integration of traditional microfinance with the internet, a move led by traditional financial institutions.
this enables them to reach a wider customer base with the help of online technology, resulting in increased operational efficiency.
the business model of internet lending incorporates innovation through point-to-point matchmaking, where investors transfer funds to the platform for lending to borrowers.
however, this model also introduces capital risks.
these risks are primarily associated with user funds being held by the online platform, the importance of the platform's credibility, the impact on the platform if borrowers default, and the potential effects of stock market volatility leading to withdrawal by users.
weak capital reserves and risk management by the platform can further exacerbate the negative outcomes, potentially causing a run due to negative news.
small businesses, individuals, and other groups not typically served by traditional financial institutions are the primary users of internet lending services.
companies providing these services focus on building their user base by offering subsidies and have minimal entry barriers for customers.
as a result, the quality of customers in internet lending carries certain risk characteristics.
in the realm of online lending, companies that are purely internet-based operate without licenses, a practice known as regulatory arbitrage.
some of these businesses lack proper risk management practices and do not meet technical standards.
as regulations become stricter over time, these companies face challenges in the market.
this has led to the closure of some platforms, disruptions in their funding sources, and harm to the customers' interests.
websites such as angellist, fundable, crowdfunder, and equitynet can also enhance information dissemination, discussions, and capital generation.
internet funds allow investment clients to directly communicate with third-party financial institutions through the internet, eliminating the need for banks as intermediaries.
this approach, known as "financial disintermediation," enhances traditional financial services by reducing the involvement of banks in connecting clients with financial management institutions.
this online financial management model enhances efficiency, lowers costs, and diminishes the intermediary role traditionally played by banks.
compared to traditional trust business, internet trust offers several advantages.
this includes utilizing internet technology to promptly share information on trust products, enhancing transparency and suiting user preferences.
it also involves improving services through the internet platform based on customer needs.
additionally, internet trust leverages technology to provide comprehensive services for customers, like net value management and coupon reminders.
this involves offering financial services digitally at every stage of a transaction using internet technology and platforms, which can include payment, financing, and settlement services among others.
the consumer finance model on the internet is categorized into two types: a vertical installment purchase platform and an e-commerce consumer finance platform.
consumers can seek instalment credit from instalment purchase platforms when making purchases.
once approved, merchants can quickly provide the requested products or services.
this approach targets areas with limited traditional consumer finance use, offering installment or consumer loan options, but it faces challenges due to stringent risk management requirements.
in the absence of leveraging e-commerce data, these platforms often resort to online credit checks resulting in higher default rates.
business risks encompass various elements such as capital flow, market cycle, interest rates, user preferences, and investor relations.
these risks are interconnected and can result in contagion between the different risk segments.
for instance, internet financial companies may face challenges in obtaining adequate funding at reasonable rates to support asset growth or meet debt obligations, leading to the risk of a capital chain breakdown.
this risk can be influenced by investor relations, as well as factors like interest rates and market cycles.
furthermore, business risks can have an external impact by interacting with other risk categories, particularly credit and operational risks.
for instance, the performance of internet finance platforms can impact the stability of their capital flows, as these platforms heavily rely on attracting users through financing and subsidies.
thus, maintaining a healthy capital flow is crucial for platform sustainability.
the payment and settlement services in internet finance are considered fundamental banking services and play a crucial role in generating significant non-interest revenue for banks.
the emergence of new payment channels in internet finance has had an impact on the traditional financial industry's intermediary operations.
there is a risk transmission mechanism that links internet finance and traditional finance.
the influence of internet lending, fund, and payment businesses on traditional banks has led to a situation where the assets, liabilities, and intermediary operations of commercial banks are being squeezed.
this has resulted in increased operational costs, reduced profitability, loss of deposits, and higher leverage ratios.
the services offered by internet finance have altered the dynamics of money supply, demand, and interest rates, impacting the macroeconomic intermediary variables.
as a consequence, bank credit has expanded, the demand for money has decreased, macroeconomic controls have weakened, and ultimately, banking crises have ensued.
as internet technology continues to eliminate industry boundaries, reduce entry barriers, and increase competition, internet companies are increasingly opting to secure technology or businesses through investments and acquisitions.
this shift has spawned a conducive environment for investment and mergers within the internet industry.
we think that investing in and acquiring companies in the internet industry can improve an individual's competitiveness in the field, but it also raises the uncertainty and risk level for the industry as a whole.
when one company faces risks, the entire industry can be impacted, leading to an increase in overall risk volatility across businesses in the industry.
in analyzing alibaba's financial report, it is evident that expenses related to research, development, and sales have been consistently rising, while interest and investment income as well as operational income have decreased.
this suggests that the company may not be seeing fruitful returns on its investments.
nevertheless, there is a faster growth in revenue, indicating a relatively positive outlook on the overall revenue and expenditure balance.
the notion of a business model in the internet sector may disrupt the traditional ideas of how value is created and acquired.
unlike conventional models, internet-based models emphasize that value can be generated not just by producers, but also by customers and other stakeholders in the value-creation process.
this perspective suggests that competitive advantage can be achieved through various means, such as having access to resources and engaging users actively.
hence, alibaba's active investments and acquisitions across various sectors are seen as enhancing its position as a leader in the digital economy in china.
the company's focus is not solely on generating profits but rather on considering whether the industry aligns with its core business or offers vital resources such as technology, services, or products to support its growth.
these ventures are aimed at driving user engagement and fostering growth within the ecosystem to create ongoing value.
nevertheless, the strategic investments and acquisitions made by alibaba continue to negatively affect its financial performance.
for instance, acquiring companies with lower profit margins or losses, like gaining control of businesses such as lazada and cainiao network, may not yield profitability in the future.
furthermore, investing in the expansion of its operations, infrastructure, and staff may expose alibaba to additional unforeseen costs, such as labor disputes, compliance expenses, and other risks.
when assessing risks, it is crucial to take into account the potential ecological significance associated with those risks.
hence, understanding how to effectively evaluate the balance between the value and risk of internet companies is a critical area of research.
the risks, whether they have happened or are anticipated, will be communicated to the market through different channels, like negative news, leading investors to adjust their expectations for the company.
consequently, these risks will manifest in fluctuations in stock prices.
we gathered stock price information for technology firms to create a model assessing risk.
fourteen chinese and american technology companies were chosen based on their primary operations and market significance.
these include alibaba, jd, facebook, paypal, ebay, google, apple, twitter, amazon, bidu, tencent, yrd, ppdf, and dnjr.
several internet finance companies that have significant market share and influence have chosen not to go public.
these companies are typically affiliated with major tech corporations.
for instance, ant financial is connected to alibaba, wechat pay to tencent, and jingdong baitiao to jingdong.
by including their parent companies in our analysis, we observe that many chinese technology firms face challenges listing in china due to regulatory concerns.
as a result, most of them opt for the adr method to list in the united states.
the opening section highlighted that internet finance combines internet technology and financial technology.
an essential aspect is to thoroughly assess risks by considering the enterprise's value and the internet ecosystem supporting it.
this is crucial because the internet industry's value is not solely generated by producers, but also by customers and other participants in their value creation network.
therefore, when examining risk formation, it is vital to account for the potential ecological value associated with the risk.
hence, previous risk studies have not sufficiently illustrated the risks within the internet industry, particularly in the realm of internet finance.
it is acknowledged that certain internet firms possess strong risk management skills, enabling them to navigate risk fluctuations effectively and establish stronger footing in the digital economy.
using a risk quantity-focused approach can often lead to distortions when measuring risks.
to mitigate this, the study emphasizes investigating risk fluctuations over time to analyze risk concerns without the influence of risk volume.
we think that levels of risk vary for internet companies, leading to different strategic approaches and expectations for future value.
even if the companies or business models acquired at present are not profitable and entail risks, they can contribute to building a future ecosystem and infrastructure.
therefore, it is necessary to assess risk fluctuations across different enterprises from a comparable standpoint by eliminating the impact of risk levels.
the bmm model utilizes various statistical techniques to analyze the highest or lowest values in a set of independent and identically distributed observational data.
as a result, it requires a significant amount of data for simulation.
in internet finance, constraints such as limited numbers of listed companies and constrained market entry times can hinder the acquisition of a substantial dataset due to abbreviated development timelines.
these research findings offer valuable insights for our own study and demonstrate the versatility of using the generalized pareto distribution in time series risk assessment across different sectors.
building upon this, the paper employs the generalized pareto distribution model to assess risks associated with businesses.
the threshold plays a crucial role in the pot model.
by predefining a threshold, all data points that surpass this threshold are grouped together and analyzed using the generalized pareto distribution to determine the risk value.
in this section, we examine four prominent internet technology firms - facebook, paypal, alibaba, and jd - to present a set of comparative data that illustrates our analysis approach.
it is important to emphasize that all these companies are involved in internet finance-related operations.
however, obtaining stock price data for some of the companies they invest in, which are not publicly listed, poses a challenge.
therefore, we have opted to focus on their parent companies - the four aforementioned firms - as the initial subjects for our research.
the primary objective of this section is to assess the efficacy of our analysis approach in order to establish a basis for the comparative analysis in subsequent sections.
initially, we applied the original risk model to assess the risk levels of the four companies.
subsequently, the data from these companies was processed using the rfr method.
following this, we utilized the accumulation area chart to illustrate the distribution of risks across each company and the overall risk trends within the dataset.
being a graphic representation based on relative heights, the stacking area graph ensures that the different categories of data points do not obscure or overlap each other.
the image above illustrates that facebook was the first company to go public, with a higher risk initially that decreased over time.
the findings indicate that paypal had the highest level of risk, with facebook, jd, and alibaba following in that order.
thus, as we anticipated, the initial level of risk cannot accurately capture the contrast in risk.
this is evident in the similar trends seen in companies like alibaba and jd, as well as facebook and paypal.
one particular internet company is observed to exhibit higher levels of volatility compared to others in real-time.
the accompanying chart illustrates the overall risk volatility of four companies.
the discussion focuses on precisely defining the risk magnitude of these enterprises without the complication of risk volume interference.
by examining the ordinate data on the chart, we can make comparisons of risk levels among the four companies at various points in time.
furthermore, the cyclical correlation among these enterprises will be elaborated on in subsequent discussions.
if individual companies do not exhibit significant risk growth, each company still experiences some level of risk increase.
in such cases, the graph on the right will indicate a large risk area, suggesting that overall enterprise risk in the industry is collectively rising, leading to an increase in industry-wide risk.
following a risk event in one company, the extent of risk contagion and its success rate within the industry are reflected in the risk metrics of other firms.
a single company facing risk can effectively spread that risk to other firms, causing overall industry risk to escalate during a specific period.
if effective risk control mechanisms prevent the spread of risk contagion in the industry, only the individual company faces increased risk, while the industry's total risk tends to remain stable.
one benefit of this approach is that it integrates both macro- and microanalysis, while also taking into account the impact of risk on the infection process.
furthermore, by selecting different threshold values, measurements can be conducted using different time units such as day, week, or month, allowing for flexibility in transforming observation index details as needed.
internet technology companies share similarities in various aspects such as their business model, operational model, profit model, and user characteristics.
as a result, it is believed that there may be a certain level of correlation in their risk fluctuation models.
figure 9 displays the risk accumulation zone of the composite index, while the subsequent image presents the risk accumulation area of fourteen companies.
by analyzing these visuals, we observe a notable difference between the trends of the internet technology industry and the composite index.
this variance helps confirm that the assumed strong correlation among cycles stems from the unique facets of the internet industry.
furthermore, it is noteworthy that the risk volatility of the composite index is notably lower compared to that of the technology industry, a distinction evident from the vertical values depicted in the graphs.
the nasdaq has become a prominent high-tech index as it encompasses various internet technology companies, ranging from telecoms to biotechnology.
it is considered a leading index for large capital growth, with significant exposure to the technology sector, making it an important consideration for investors.
the volatility in risk is more significant for technology companies, but the trends in risk remain largely consistent across different data values.
this supports our theory that the stock market where companies are listed will result in a convergence of changes in risk.
moreover, this also indicates that technology firms are open to implementing more rigorous risk management measures.
for instance, the data shows that following a period of elevated risk levels, there is often a sharp decrease in risk values rather than a sustained increase.
instances of prolonged risk escalation are rare.
to achieve this, we tallied instances where the rfr exceeded or fell below 0, enabling us to determine if the risk trajectory fell within a high or low-risk range during a specific timeframe.
the major players in the internet industry control a large share of user traffic in the market, and they are willing to offer concessions, subsidies, and increase investments to attract more traffic.
this tendency poses a risk in the internet finance sector.
if most investors involved in internet financial products are primarily motivated by the perks they receive, there is a high probability that some users will lack the necessary investment knowledge and risk awareness.
we also explore the various business models within internet finance and examine the common occurrences of mergers and investments across the internet sector.
we clarify the motivations behind such actions and evaluate how they influence the overall ecological value and risk levels in the internet industry.
in conclusion, we express reservations regarding the internet industry.
when it comes to acquiring and investing in internet companies, the primary risk factor is the "externality" of microeconomic risk-taking behavior.
if a major internet firm prioritizes the future ecological impact over the profitability of the acquired enterprise during the acquisition of an internet finance company, the purchased company becomes vulnerable to risks such as crisis events and uncertainties.
this research examines the accuracy of rent estimates available for different cities by analyzing craigslist listings.
the study finds that existing data sources often underestimate the true cost of renting a property, impacting individuals looking to relocate between cities or those using vouchers.
the paper discusses various rental data sources, summarizes past research on rising rental costs, details the methods used to compare data across 25 metropolitan areas, and proposes ways to improve the availability of spot market data for planners.
many official and private data sources on rental prices provide information on the terms of existing leases, helping decision-makers analyze affordability, set fair market rents, and understand how much current tenants are paying relative to their income and other factors.
however, this data may not capture the dynamic nature of the rental market where landlords and prospective tenants negotiate new rent amounts.
asking rents might significantly differ from reported transacted rents due to delays in data publication, market fluctuations, government subsidies, and rent regulations.
data on transacted rents mostly overlook the real-time changes in rental rates, especially in areas with rapidly increasing rents or a high number of rent-controlled properties.
these are the areas of primary interest to housing experts, professionals, and advocates for fair and inclusive housing practices.
the authors express their gratitude to paul waddell for kindly permitting the use of data that was originally gathered in his laboratory at uc berkeley.
blockchain technology is a connected chain of blocks storing transaction data and user information, operating through a decentralized digital ledger system.
it facilitates secure and confidential financial transactions among network users, with validation and approval by all participants in a transparent manner.
its popularity has grown due to the use of digital currencies, presenting a promising future for online transactions, despite facing security challenges and vulnerabilities.
this paper explores blockchain methodology, applications, and security concerns, providing insights for enthusiasts and researchers in this field.
blockchain is the underlying technology of the digital currency bitcoin and has become highly significant in the digital realm due to its key characteristics like decentralization, immutability, anonymity, and suitability for electronic transactions.
there are four main types of blockchains that are worth noting.
the sender has enough bitcoin in their account for transfer, and the specific amount they want to transfer has not been sent to anyone else.
for instance, when someone is attempting to transfer digital currency like bitcoin to you, the private key stored in your wallet must correspond with the important public address assigned to your wallet.
only if these two keys align will the digital currency be successfully sent to the public address of your wallet during the transaction processing.
primary information: information related to transactions will be stored in blocks.
the type of transaction data stored will be determined by the specific services for which the blockchain is being utilized.
for financial institutions such as banks, the stored data will primarily consist of financial transaction information.
the timestamp will be found in the blocks as well.
in this context, the timestamp indicates the specific date and time when a block is created.
modifying the input even slightly causes the hash output to differ significantly.
the variations seem to happen arbitrarily without any predictable pattern.
despite this randomness, no one has been able to decipher how the alterations in the input affect the hash output.
the hash algorithm is designed to be irreversible, making it challenging to crack.
proof of work involves validating the hash value of a block against a set range.
if the hash value falls within the range, the block is accepted; otherwise, it is rejected.
miners participate in a competitive process to find the correct hash value for a block within the specified range in the pow system.
miners receive the information and attempt to solve a mathematical problem known as hashing.
currently, the attacker can work out the math problem independently and generate a new block without sharing it with the rest of the network.
the unauthorized blockchain grows by the attacker adding more blocks, which are then shared with the network.
in the united states, there were similar sentiments expressed and financial support for infectious disease training programs started to decrease as government funding shifted to other priorities.
the invention of the microscope in the 1600s by leeuwenhoek enabled researchers to see micro-organisms for the first time.
in the 1800s, advancements in understanding and identifying micro-organisms were made.
vaccines were created and implemented, adding to the strategies available for disease control and prevention.
pasteurization also played a significant role in controlling diseases.
recognizing the link between the environment and infectious diseases led to the adoption of comprehensive measures like community sanitation, personal hygiene, and public health education.
moreover, the significance of nutrition in influencing infectious diseases was acknowledged.
recent events have shown that we cannot lower our defenses against infectious diseases.
while there has been advancement in managing these diseases, we should not be careless.
the articles in this edition of the journal highlight the ongoing global impact of infectious diseases and the significance of new research in developing prevention and control strategies.
as we address emerging and recurring infectious diseases, it is important to recognize the impact of other health conditions on our society.
with limited resources for disease control and prevention, it is crucial to enhance resource utilization through improved planning, training, efficiency, and international collaboration.
these measures will be instrumental in reducing the overall disease burden.
similar to the broad scope of feminism, feminist media theory and research also vary and encompass a wide range of perspectives.
with the increasing influence of media in our lives and the acknowledgment that gender is influenced by media, feminist scholars have focused on analyzing media content since the 1970s.
although feminist analysis of media is extensive and multifaceted, initially, the main emphasis was on examining how gender is portrayed and the underlying ideologies in media content.
scholars have highlighted the significance of representation in media, asserting that various media forms, whether factual or fictional, shape perceptions and convey messages about diverse groups to the audience.
advocating for social change does not weaken feminist scholarship; on the contrary, it is highlighted as a key strength in the chapters of this book's third section.
this area has seen significant progress in recent years and presents new challenges to be addressed.
feminist theory is a comprehensive theoretical framework that links empirical data and observations with critical analysis of gender-related issues and identities.
it seeks to elucidate the dynamics of gender inequality, power structures, and patriarchal systems, examining how gender and power impact various aspects of society.
while older feminist perspectives were criticized for being limited in scope and focusing predominantly on white experiences, modern feminist theory now addresses broader forms of subordination and dominance that extend beyond gender, taking into account intersectional identities.
feminist scholars have criticized the mass media for symbolically erasing women.
these scholars have published numerous articles in mainstream communication journals, as well as authored and edited countless books on this topic.
my work has evolved to be more reliant on data, as i have taken on larger and more complex projects that involve managing information through spreadsheets and data analysis.
while i identify as an empirical feminist researcher, i still value critical theories that focus on addressing inequality and promoting social change.
my background in feminist activism has influenced my research interests and the theoretical frameworks i engage with.
around twelve years ago, i started delving into theory building to meet my own standards.
my research has always revolved around the influence of feminist movements, which i actively participated in during the 1970s and 1980s.
i used my journalism background to support causes like anti-violence and equal pay by writing press releases and assisting with media-related tasks.
transitioning into academia in the late 1980s, i pondered on evaluating and elucidating the outcomes of our feminist activism, especially in terms of enhancing how the media reflects feminist perspectives.
originally used mainly for analyzing entertainment media, media scholars have now extended the concept of symbolic annihilation to include news coverage.
this chapter and our theoretical argument are centered around this application.
the concept of symbolic annihilation originated in the united states and is based on western beliefs in individualism, democratic involvement, and gender equality.
media is seen as influential in spreading societal values and reflecting social norms.
however, the question arises if this theory can be applicable in non-western regions like qatar.
we then considered how to apply a theory based on modernity and western progressive liberal thought in the arab gulf region without falling into orientalist stereotypes or appearing condescending.
to achieve this, we needed to remove the inherent biases of the theory and avoid viewing gulf societies solely through a western lens of progress.
instead, we chose to examine state policies and cultural values within the context of the society itself.
our success was measured by the detailed analysis we conducted on qatar's policies and cultural practices.
symbolic annihilation theory posited a link between the portrayal of women in media and their social situation, but our detailed examination offers a more intricate view.
while qatari women are not prominently depicted in local news, they are increasingly active in the workforce.
yet in qatari culture, the absence of women's visual representation in media is not significant as there is no societal pressure for equal gender representation.
this stands in contrast to societies where gender equality in media is expected and shapes material reality.
when analyzing how female sexuality is portrayed in the media, it is important to take into account the various factors that influence its creation and perception.
factors such as gender, class, race, nationality, and social and political power dynamics play a significant role in shaping the portrayal of sexuality in media outlets.
dead-naming is the act of using the birth names of transgender individuals as opposed to their chosen names.
in general, there is a need to examine economic relationships at a global scale in order to focus on achieving gender justice in the field of sports media instead of simply incorporating women into current flawed models of sport.
nevertheless, simply focusing on sensationalist journalism and its detractors is insufficient for comprehending the media discourse and online commentary surrounding symbolic violence within the digital public sphere of the southern cone.
this realm perpetuates and amplifies gender disparities, giving rise to a parallel world where symbolic violence is prevalent.
embedded within our physical bodies and digital stories, there exist enduring structures that manifest within the impersonal and anonymous realms of digital spaces in the southern cone.
therefore, it appears that there is a lack of any discussion taking place in these areas that are intended for public use.
in december 2012, in new delhi, india, a group of men on a bus raped a 23-year-old woman, as well as assaulted her and her friend before leaving them on the side of the road.
tragically, the rape victim passed away from her injuries ten days later.
this incident sparked widespread outrage and protests across india, with people organizing candlelight vigils and demonstrations to demand justice in the face of perceived state inaction.
despite attempts by the police to disperse the protests using tear gas and water cannons, the events gained significant coverage from both indian and international media.
this moment was instrumental in catalyzing a broader conversation about the societal, political, and institutional factors contributing to gender-based violence.
news coverage of two recent instances of gang rape in india and south africa, both countries known for high rates of sexual violence, shared some similarities despite their differences.
media framed these incidents as extraordinary and unique, raising questions about the impact of this exceptionalism on how such cases are perceived and discussed.
this paradoxical approach undermines the efforts of feminist activism, and i delve into feminist media criticism of this practice.
the influence of digital media has amplified this trend, requiring new strategies from feminists in combating gender-based violence, a topic explored in the chapter's conclusion.
i will briefly discuss the history of feminisms in turkey and the united states to lay the groundwork for comparison.
more focus will be placed on the history of feminism in turkey, as it may be less known to readers.
to achieve this goal, we first discuss the evolution and conceptualization of feminism in academic settings.
we highlight the various ways in which feminist scholars in communication and media studies have actively engaged in interventions aimed at generating research that can drive policy changes, social reforms, or empower the communities under study.
we then share our own endeavors in this area, specifically focusing on a program designed to empower middle and early high school girls with online skills.
we wrap up by reflecting on the challenges and opportunities in aligning academic activities such as research, teaching, and service with interventionist objectives, particularly for tenure-track feminist scholars in communication and media studies at american universities.
the maryland pilot semester was both rewarding and challenging as we collaborated with a team of seven wikid grrls teachers and researchers to set up the program.
we partnered with a private school, two public middle schools, and one public high school in maryland.
while all schools were eager to work with us, two of them had limited resources.
the private school was well-equipped with high-tech devices, a beautiful sunlit room, and a dedicated liaison teacher.
in contrast, another school lacked basic equipment like sound systems or projectors, and the teacher was devoted but overwhelmed.
we had to adjust our curriculum to cater to both low-tech and high-tech schools, ensuring that our exercises could be conducted without the need for videos or loudspeakers.
additionally, schools often required us to share website links in advance, as certain websites were blocked on their networks.
the main concern is whether interventions like the one mentioned should align with the traditional hierarchy in academia, where research holds more importance than teaching and service, particularly at research-oriented institutions.
research quality is often judged by publication quantity and prestige rather than the effort, organization, and impact of the work.
the question arises of whether a long-term project that yields only a few publications can be as valued as multiple publications generated using different methods in the same timeframe.
the implications for tenure-track faculty need to be considered, as pursuing such studies may pose risks in the context of tenure evaluation timelines.
although it might appear initially that female broadcasters in regional or rural locations did not need to possess the same skills as those in coastal areas, this was not entirely true.
if they failed to connect with their audience or build a sense of rapport, they risked losing their broadcasting positions.
in the postcolonial and transnational environment, there is a significant connection between knowledge and power through representational activities.
the realm of feminist cultural and media studies is ready for further investigation to explore how systems of representation are connected to the movement of labor, capital, and goods.
while it is important to analyze representation in the global media era, it is equally critical to examine the uneven cultural, political, and economic interactions occurring within a web of international connections and transactions.
war rugs are popular among military personnel and carpet collectors, who are among the primary purchasers of these items.
in war literature in the united states, the house is often portrayed as a place of military defense, contrasting with oriental carpets symbolizing peaceful gardens untouched by war.
the concept of the home has shifted with the introduction of war carpets, blurring the line between defense and offense.
this dynamic forces consumers to withdraw and isolate themselves.
as labor remains confined in war zones or refugee camps, war carpets become mobile, offering a sense of being at home while also being detached from the war, within the everyday realms of empire.
war, as well as the unrestricted movement of goods, allows for the implementation of neoliberal strategies such as restricting access to credit, disregarding infrastructure development, ignoring technical education, feminizing the workforce, and relocating goods to conflict zones and refugee camps.
additionally, neoliberal governance promotes a type of consumerism that masks the harsh realities of war and militarism in regions where goods can be manufactured at lower costs, often at the expense of smaller producers.
war carpets transform the sorrowful experience of war into a pleasurable act of consumption.
the process of beautifying and idolizing war carpets signifies the remembrance of war intertwined with feminized labor, its denial, and its continuation in daily life within various locations like war zones, refugee camps, and remote settlements.
the beauty associated with acquiring, displaying, trading, and owning these carpets is, in my opinion, rather lacking in sensitivity, as it overlooks the harsh reality and emotional impact of war by making it seem more domesticated and guilt-inducing.
in fact, since the 1980s, war carpets have evolved into a subtle means of culturally suppressing the memories of war.
in the continuously evolving realm of cyber threats, the integration of ai and cybersecurity is essential.
the article discusses the rise of cyberattacks driven by artificial intelligence, which exploit ai's capabilities for launching faster and more advanced attacks.
as cybercriminals adapt and improve their tactics, it is evident that researchers, policymakers, and industry professionals must utilize ai for defense purposes.
to combat ai-driven attacks, it is proposed to enhance advanced ai systems that can detect and respond to existing threats, forming a foundation for a proactive defense strategy against the dynamic cyber threat landscape.
the survey aims to guide future research and efforts in fortifying digital infrastructures against the persistent and adaptable nature of digital adversaries.
phishing attacks: advanced technology systems powered by artificial intelligence effectively identify phishing attempts by analyzing email content, user activity, and organization traffic to detect suspicious patterns typically associated with phishing activities.
insider threats: artificial intelligence systems can detect potential insider risks such as unauthorized access or data exfiltration by monitoring client activities and access patterns and identifying abnormal behavior.
machine learning algorithms are important for enhancing the ability to detect threats effectively.
random forest is well-suited for handling vast amounts of data and intricate relationships, which makes it effective in identifying various types of threats.
autoencoders are neural network models that are commonly used to reduce the dimensionality of data and identify anomalies by reconstructing input data and flagging instances that deviate significantly from the norm.
continuous learning is a key benefit of integrating artificial intelligence, allowing these systems to improve over time by enhancing their ability to identify and respond to emerging threats.
although ai can handle routine tasks efficiently, human oversight remains crucial for providing strategic guidance, refining policies, and addressing complex aspects of cybersecurity incidents.
by combining ai capabilities with human expertise, a more robust and adaptable incident response system is created to effectively deal with evolving cyber threats.
potential biases in ai models: concerns arise regarding the integrity, accuracy, and reliability of cybersecurity defenses due to potential predispositions in artificial intelligence models.
these biases may originate from a variety of factors such as skewed training data, algorithmic choices, or cultural biases within datasets.
biases in data, stemming from misrepresented datasets, can perpetuate existing cultural prejudices.
within cybersecurity, biased datasets can lead to disproportionate emphasis on certain threats, skewing risk assessments and potentially overlooking specific types of dangers.
machine learning has become a fundamental aspect of information technology and is now greatly integrated into our daily lives, often in inconspicuous ways.
as the volume of data continues to grow, there is a strong indication that intelligent data analysis will increasingly play a crucial role in driving technological advancements.
data mining and machine learning are closely interconnected, and by using effective learning algorithms, useful conclusions can be drawn.
advances in smart and nano technologies have significantly improved the fields of data mining and machine learning, sparking interest in discovering concealed patterns within data for gaining valuable insights.
the integration of statistics, machine learning, information theory, and computing has formed a robust scientific discipline with a strong mathematical foundation and highly effective tools at its disposal.
machine learning algorithms are grouped into categories depending on their intended results.
supervised learning aims to create a mapping function that connects input data to specific output values.
partial node ordering involves specifying the relationship between nodes by indicating that one node occurs before another in the sequence.
in conclusion, decision trees and naive bayes typically perform differently in terms of accuracy, with one excelling when the other does not.
in contrast, decision trees and rule classifiers are usually similar in how they operate.
similarly, support vector machines (svm) and artificial neural networks (ann) tend to have comparable operational profiles.
it is important to note that no single learning algorithm is superior across all datasets.
this study suggests that when dealing with extensive data sets, it is beneficial to utilize a distributed processing system.
this allows for increased correlation among variables, leading to a more effective model output.
ultimately, npt and yp presented differing perspectives on the causes of the initial stabbings, attributing blame to either the students involved, the aggressive officers, or broader factors such as concentrated poverty.
despite serving similar bronx communities and aiming for community empowerment and educational reform, the two groups employed contrasting approaches, with one side avoiding discussions on race while the other directly addressed racial issues, leading to varying outcomes.
racism is widespread, and believing in equality without considering race only deals with obvious forms of individual racism, not the systemic disparities that exist between different social groups.
while some of the leaders come from middle-class backgrounds, a majority of the individuals interviewed were either poor or working class.
the specific distribution of genders within the memberships was not provided.
from what i noticed, fathers were seldom seen at meetings for most organizations, although they occasionally participated in larger demonstrations.
an organization called yp stood out because it had an almost equal representation of males and females within its youth membership.
as they became more comfortable in my company and began to trust me, they started to reveal and tell many stories that together create the counter-narratives crucial to critical race theory practice.
the study conducted multiple rounds of fieldwork, analyzed data, cross-checked information, and validated data to present results that emphasized the perspectives of the participants.
all names of the individuals and organizations involved in the fieldwork have been altered in this paper to maintain confidentiality.
as the five education organizing groups appear similar in their descriptions and in media coverage, advocacy groups and research centers tend to mention them together in policy documents.
however, an in-depth examination from a critical race theory standpoint enables a closer exploration of the intricate discussions and conflicts within their everyday operations.
the upcoming sections will utilize fundamental principles of critical race theory to address the challenges in presenting alternative narratives within education organizing groups and the strategies these groups employ to navigate racial complexities.
if no clearly racist actions are taken, discussions about race are avoided and systemic racism is not acknowledged.
therefore, to improve schools, it is advisable to unite all stakeholders and minimize any evidence of inequality among them.
carol frequently communicated with individuals who only spoke spanish by using english, and would occasionally continue providing instructions without giving them time for translation.
we viewed videos that carol had brought along, including one that explored sexual relationships among adults in the african-american community.
several passengers on the bus requested content that was more suitable for children.
this story underscores the challenges faced by education organizing groups when attempting to bring forward alternative perspectives.
one obstacle is the need to address language barriers among organizers and leaders.
another challenge is the fear that any discussions criticizing racial divisions may be misinterpreted as racist or as diverting attention from the organization's primary goals.
despite these difficulties, these groups are united in their struggle against significant external forces of disenfranchisement.
education organizing groups must prioritize building community power in a way that promotes long-term anti-racist school reform, without relying on short-term strategies like interest convergence.
this section examines the third and fourth central principles of critical race theory (crt) - the social construction of race and amplification of voices of color - highlighting their interconnectedness.
a fundamental challenge in achieving equitable education lies in reconciling these principles, particularly in how to allow diverse viewpoints to emerge within united advocacy efforts by case study groups.
all five of the organizations studied take care to offer subgroups the space they need to bond within the organization, enabling them to gather, create campaigns, and bring in new members.
these subgroups meet with organizers who understand their language, and meetings are scheduled to suit member availability.
these bonding spaces serve as platforms where leaders can share their challenges and experiences.
according to critical race theory (crt), individuals in the cc did not get the opportunity to express their views on how race is constructed socially.
this was likely because the diverse perspectives of individuals from various subgroups were not effectively shared with the whole organization.
crt proponents may suggest that rather than being worried that discussing race would divide the groups, presenting alternative viewpoints could help members understand the social construction of race and enable them to address racial issues effectively.
the next trend that appears concerns the presence of some bridging spaces that are available but have limitations.
in these instances, translation is frequently utilized and subgroups convene regularly, but discussions about race are seldom addressed.
nicole, another leader at fnn, pointed out that according to official guidelines, organizers are meant to stay quiet to ensure that ideas and campaign thoughts come from the participants themselves.
however, she highlighted that this silence could be deceiving as organizers may have their own opinions and may subtly influence discussions to guide the group towards a certain conclusion.
over time, creating connections between different groups enables leaders to approach issues related to race in a constructive manner.
despite facing common challenges such as campaign issues and struggling schools similar to those in other organizations studied, these leaders also engage in shared activities like reading the autobiography of malcolm x, discussing poems in meetings, and sharing music downloads.
these cultural artifacts often carry racial connotations, which the youth view as valuable mediums for communication.
due to the personal nature of the stories shared and the emphasis on mutual support, members feel at ease discussing race without being solely defined by it.
critical race theory (crt) has always emphasized the importance of taking action and viewed educational organizing as a key method to drive change.
however, different educational organizing groups have diverse approaches to creating alternative teaching methods and education policies.
crt advocates for aligning everyday actions with aspirations for social transformation.
rather than focusing solely on charismatic leaders, crt emphasizes the significance of organizational processes, allowing space for positive social changes within the various organizations examined.
the following part delves into the better-known body of critical race theory (crt) scholarship, which originated within a legal studies strand that emerged in the united states during the civil rights movement.
hegemony refers to the control or influence of one cultural group over another.
this control does not always involve force but can also be upheld through the agreement of the subordinate group, as they start to embrace and incorporate the beliefs and standards of the dominant group.
a more detailed examination of the concept of hegemony is available in chapter 2, focusing on the ideas of antonio gramsci.
due to the dominance of one group over others, nonwhite individuals may resist and also perpetuate whiteness, causing them to experience a sense of dual awareness known as double consciousness.
the paragraph discusses the challenges in employing critical race theory concepts in educational research and offers teaching techniques for incorporating crt in actual classroom environments.
stovall incorporates the concept of voice as a component of critical race theory in his teaching method.
he values his students' personal experiences related to race and encourages them to use these real-world encounters as a foundation for exploring issues of race.
while some may emphasize intricate theoretical readings on race to enhance students' understanding of the topic, stovall prioritizes his students' experiential knowledge.
although he includes theoretical texts in his course materials, he views them as supplementary rather than central to the discussions.
by allowing students to start the discussion from a point where they feel most comfortable sharing their insights, stovall not only embraces a crt principle but also demonstrates a profound understanding of effective teaching methods and student learning processes.
the use of combination therapies holds great promise for improving cancer patient outcomes.
however, identifying effective combinations is a complex task due to the vast number of approved cancer drugs and the challenges involved in systematically testing all possible combinations.
to address this, new systems approaches are needed to streamline the selection and prioritization of drug combinations for further experimental testing.
furthermore, the unique properties of immunotherapies add an additional layer of complexity to the development of combination treatments, which is further complicated by evolving regulatory standards, particularly in the case of novel agents like cell-based therapies.
combination immunotherapy represents the future of treating cancer, and its effectiveness relies on overcoming these obstacles during the development process to deliver the most advantageous treatment to patients.

this part discusses the obstacles involved in detecting cybersecurity breaches.
it is possible to personalize the system to be compatible with several conventional sensors that collect and transmit data to the ccs module in rdf format supported by the uco schema for additional analysis.
the trial setup featured monitoring agents for both processes and files, as well as a snort agent.
the file monitoring agent is a specialized tool connected to an ia module, operating similarly to a process monitoring agent and operating on all host machines to gather various statistics related to files.
in order to focus monitoring efforts, a list of critical files is maintained to detect suspicious activity.
criteria for flagging files as suspicious include new files generated or modified by new processes, large files obtained from the internet, or files copied from external storage devices.
details sent to the ccs module consist of which process modified the file, its size, creation method, and other file attributes.
developed in python utilizing the watchdog observer library, the file monitor agent allows real-time monitoring of all file actions in specified directories.
like the process monitoring agent, it translates file operation data into rdf format and transmits the information to the ccs module.
we examined the performance of our system by simulating a ransomware attack in a specific scenario.
we detail the unique ransomware attack created for this situation, the network setup utilized during the test, the actions carried out by the cognitive assistant when identifying the attack, and our assessment of its effectiveness.
the primary detection techniques are implemented on the ccs master machine, which is equipped with key components: a fuseki server incorporating jena, an industry-standard owl dl reasoner, the customized uco ontology, and associated swrl rules.
another component is the ccs module, responsible for gathering fresh insights on host machine behavior and potential threats, conducting analysis, and continuously refreshing the ccs dashboard.
moreover, snort and a snort agent are operated on this machine, although snort can alternatively be deployed on a separate machine as the agent will handle transmitting its data to the ccs master module.
the ccs modules were integrated and a network was established as detailed in section vi-b.
the focus is now on identifying a ransomware attack.
by incorporating common knowledge and cyber-attack information, the knowledge graph was enhanced.
the research highlights that basic knowledge can effectively aid in recognizing and preventing new attacks through the experimental setup.
the attack timeline and the corresponding actions of the ccs module are depicted in figure 6, with a detailed breakdown of each step presented below.
we created a proof of concept ccs system with a cognitive dashboard that reports cybersecurity incidents to analysts.
our system was tested against a custom ransomware and proved effective by reducing the cognitive burden on analysts dealing with complex events in large organizations.
the system integrates data from various sources and provides reasoning in a way that mimics human analyst behavior.
the competitive nature of markets drives companies to develop ai quickly in order to outperform their rivals.
the cost and complexity of ensuring the safety of large-scale ai systems present challenges.
balancing the need for safety with the desire for rapid innovation necessitates regulatory intervention to foster a supportive environment for investments in safe development.
one important difference between regulatory markets and self-regulation is that in regulatory markets, the government is responsible for determining the desired outcomes of regulation, rather than leaving it to the regulated entities.
in this system, governments create and manage the regulatory market structure and supervise the entities operating within it.
our proposal for regulatory markets aims to establish a system of supervision and transparency for private regulation.
we suggest utilizing market mechanisms to create efficient and advanced forms of regulation without solely relying on self-regulation.
instead, we advocate for the introduction of an additional market layer comprising independent private regulators who are accountable to government oversight and adaptable to the rapid advancements and complexities of ai technologies on a global scale.
policy labs in the government involve civil servants learning and using human-centered design and data analytics to create new ways to regulate and deliver public services.
certification bodies may be seen as competitors to some extent, as they vie to be embraced voluntarily by a significant portion of a specific industry to establish themselves as the global standard.
however, this competition is more about achieving widespread acceptance rather than a traditional market competition.
once a dominant standard is established, there is a risk of stagnation without ongoing competitive pressure, which is crucial for fostering continued innovation.
enhancing the capacity to develop creative regulatory strategies may involve shifting regulatory responsibilities from the public sector to markets.
by establishing regulatory markets that encourage investments in regulatory innovation, such as human and financial resources, we suggest a framework that draws on non-governmental regulators and redefined roles for private entities in regulatory governance.
private regulators have the flexibility to use more than just traditional regulatory methods.
they could create technologies that influence the decisions made by the businesses they regulate.
their authority to enforce regulations comes from a contract with the target company and approval from governments to issue fines or impose regulations on companies that are subject to their oversight.
private regulators have created various regulatory methods which could encompass tools for assessing risk, software for processing information, procedures for managing conflicts or complaints, and more.
in relation to autonomous vehicles, governments could define limits for accident rates and levels of traffic congestion.
they could also create guidelines focusing on upholding public trust in road safety.
in the banking sector, governments have the authority to determine criteria for customers to access credit.
they can create guidelines related to tracking transactions and ensuring trust in the stability of financial systems.
in terms of the application of facial recognition technology in drones, governments may set limits on the probability of unauthorized users accessing the software.
they may also define guidelines, such as ensuring that individuals give informed consent to being recognized.
regulatory mechanisms are necessary to uphold the safety and benefits of ai systems.
it is likely that we will require ai to help oversee and control other ai systems.
a key strategy to encourage sustainable investments in developing regulatory ai is by providing market incentives, such as recognizing and rewarding these efforts with financial gain and personal fulfillment.
one advantage of the regulatory markets model is that it supports the growth of a strong and autonomous regulatory sector.
this can provide a counterbalance to the increasing influence of major tech corporations involved in ai advancement.
it offers a compromise between government-imposed regulations and self-regulation by tech companies, which is typically seen as inadequate.
private regulators have the potential to regulate data more efficiently compared to government regulators due to certain constraints that government regulation faces.
governments sharing data may lead to concerns regarding data misuse, whereas commercial entities can establish more secure data-sharing processes through contracts and intellectual property rights.
as a result, private regulators can directly monitor data in companies and explore innovative technological collaboration between regulators and businesses.
in regulatory markets, there are concerns about the need to maintain competitiveness and independence among private regulators who oversee the entities they regulate.
in conclusion, while multi-jurisdictional regulators offer the advantage of allowing less wealthy jurisdictions to benefit from the regulatory efforts of wealthier ones, there is a risk that a widespread free-riding issue may lead to insufficient investment in regulatory oversight by governments overall.
yet, governmental oversight is crucial for any regulatory system to be effective.
the shortcomings in the faa's oversight practices serve as a warning for our proposed regulatory markets, highlighting the importance of having a funding model that accurately reflects the cost of regulation.
in our proposal, part of this cost would be incorporated into the market as the price for regulatory services, instead of relying solely on government funding and budget allocations.
in this section, we will illustrate a potential implementation of regulatory markets by addressing a recognized risk in the field of ai: the threat of adversarial attacks on ai models.
when we use our model in terms of adversarial protection, we start by identifying the important participants involved.
private regulators in the commercial drone industry must obtain a license from relevant government agencies in each jurisdiction where they operate.
for instance, if drone regulation is city-specific, private regulators would need to apply for licenses from individual cities.
there is a possibility that some cities might recognize licenses issued by others, making it easier for companies using drones to fulfill their regulatory obligations by purchasing services from approved regulators.
a license granted to a private regulator may initially have a limited scope, allowing for regulatory oversight of specific aspects such as the security of deep learning models in commercial drones.
however, one advantage of establishing a regulatory market is that private regulators would be motivated to broaden their scope.
this could involve proposing to government agencies for an expanded license to cover other deep learning models, extending regulations beyond commercial drones, or increasing regulatory capacity for various aspects of the drone industry, such as safety standards.
in addition to the previously mentioned negative impact, it raises an interesting query about how judges might treat politicians differently based on their status in office during a trial.
given that politicians in office hold more power as they actively make policy decisions, one hypothesis suggests that judges may scrutinize elected officials more.
an ideal experiment to address this issue would involve randomly assigning office status to involved politicians in court cases and comparing their respective outcomes.
by doing so, we could analyze the differences in treatment between elected and non-elected officials and identify any biases for or against those in office.
however, due to ethical constraints, such an experiment is unfeasible, and the regression discontinuity design utilized in this paper serves as the best approximation available.
despite the anticipation of a positive effect from the allocation of more resources to the judicial branch, the actual reason for cooperation does not stem from favorable rulings.
instead, state judges rule against politicians in small claims cases with low importance to demonstrate their power and to secure cooperation from local politicians.
china's housing market has experienced immense growth since the early 2000s, becoming a crucial part of household assets following housing reform.
in contrast, the stock market and other financial markets in china have struggled, exemplified by the shanghai stock exchange seeing a significant decline from its peak in 2007.
the prolonged downturn in the stock market has diminished investor interest, causing many families to withdraw from stock investments entirely.
the robust real estate market and the underperforming stock market have ignited a new conversation.
some people argue that the significant growth of the real estate market has limited the growth of other financial markets.
is this phenomenon known as crowding out a factor?
specifically, how does the housing market impact the stock investments of households?
emerging evidence suggests that outcomes may vary when analyzing data from various countries or even when using data from the same country.
for chinese residents, their sentiment towards stock investment shifts based on changes in specific property values, even if the ratio of housing investments in net assets remains constant.
as a result, the focus is on the cost of housing investment as an explanatory factor rather than its proportion in the overall investment cost.
in this framework, the housing investment cost is the independent variable, while whether a household engages in the stock market is the dependent variable, along with the proportion of stock investment cost to total investment cost.
the model simplifies by not accounting for the timing of household investment behavior.
therefore, housing investment cost represents the nominal expenditure at the time, as does the stock investment cost.
the total investment cost is the aggregate of nominal expenses across investments without adjustment for present value or inflation rates.
in particular, the definitions of financial literacy and risk attitude are important to highlight.
in table 1, we present descriptive data on the variables utilized in this study.
the average yearly household income is 80,000 yuan, and the mean plus one standard deviation is 200,000 yuan.
this suggests that the household income within the sample, specifically the annual earnings of urban residents who own property, is predominantly around 200,000 yuan.
initially, the study looks at how housing investment influences the involvement of households in the stock market, then it examines how housing investment affects the percentage of household stock assets compared to their overall investment portfolio.
this study utilizes the mathematical model mentioned earlier to examine the impact of housing investment as the main variable along with various control factors including housing investment profit, stock investment profit, education, financial literacy, age, age squared, gender, marital status, family size, household income, and household wealth.
the study ultimately derives meaningful regression findings.
as for the research methodology, the paper performs probit and tobit regression analyses for different types of households.
however, due to non-convergent probit regression results regarding stock market participation in risk-averse families, the paper opts for ols regression instead.
subsequently, a correction parameter is employed in the second stage, along with an extra variable included in the equation estimation to adjust for selectivity bias before conducting a heckman model calculation to estimate the stock value.
even after conducting the heckman model test, it is still not possible to entirely resolve the issue of endogeneity.
for instance, there are residents who purchase houses out of necessity rather than purely as an investment.
the paragraph suggests that housing investment influences household involvement in the stock market, leading to increased participation in stock ownership.
however, despite their efforts, many residents struggle with stock market investments, experiencing losses that deter them from investing further.
as a result, when they acquire new income, they are less likely to invest or choose to invest less in the stock market.
older age plays a significant role in increasing the likelihood of individuals participating in the stock market and holding stocks in their portfolio.
this suggests that middle-aged and elderly individuals may be more open to exploring different investment opportunities as they accumulate wealth over time.
the outcomes of the regression analysis for individuals with varying risk attitudes also illustrate these patterns, which will not be elaborated on at this point.
while probit and tobit regression analyses have suggested that increased housing investment may be displacing household stock investment, this finding could be impacted by certain endogeneity issues.
in order to address this concern, the study employed the heckman model.
the analysis also considered the interaction of housing investment costs and financial literacy to assess their combined impact on the proportion of household stock investment, as shown in table 3.
the common clinical situation that illustrates acute myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury is when a patient presents with an acute st-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and is treated with either thrombolytic therapy or percutaneous coronary intervention.
a treatment that safeguards the heart from acute ischemia-reperfusion injury (iri) could potentially offer broader protection to other essential organs like the brain, kidney, and liver.
however, there is a lack of clinical studies exploring new heart-protective approaches in the context of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr).
it is crucial to consider the results of prior preclinical and clinical studies when designing the clinical cardioprotection study.
there is currently no effective treatment to protect heart muscle cells from damage caused by restricted blood flow or reperfusion injury in patients experiencing acute myocardial infarction (mi).
numerous therapies have been investigated over the past few decades as additional treatments alongside reperfusion therapy, but most have yielded disappointing results in terms of reducing injury and improving outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for st-segment elevation mi.
table 1 summarizes several significant clinical studies that failed to show any benefit for reperfused mi patients and highlights various reasons for these failures, such as not considering factors that could affect cardioprotection.
frequently, these studies are dismissed as negative, which means the chance to find new treatments for patients with acute myocardial infarction is overlooked.
in clinical trials focused on protecting the heart, it is crucial to evaluate the key factors that influence the size of heart attacks in patients with st-elevated myocardial infarction undergoing treatments to restore blood flow to the heart.
the diversity of patients receiving cardiopulmonary bypass surgery and the many variables that could affect cardioprotection complicate the selection process for clinical studies in cabg patients.
it is crucial to consider the specific type of surgery, as patients undergoing cabg differ from those undergoing valve surgery.
factors such as hypertrophy in patients with aortic conditions may influence the effectiveness of cardioprotective interventions.
the possibility of direct myocardial injury during cabg surgery affecting results also needs to be acknowledged.
therefore, focusing on patients undergoing either cabg or valve surgery alone may be more advisable for cardioprotection studies.
defining a singular style in contemporary art is challenging due to the diverse approaches artists take.
they employ a variety of mediums and materials to express a range of ideas, themes, and subjects.
there is ongoing discussion regarding whether self-taught contemporary artists can be classified as modern artists and if their work fits into the category of contemporary art.
generally, there is a belief that because these artists are self-taught and operate independently from trained artists, their creations might not meet the criteria to be considered art.
as a result, some prefer using the term outsider art to define art produced by individuals outside the traditional art sphere.

do those brief sentences provide sufficient insight into why an increasing number of users are transitioning to wordpress?
editing wordpress themes can be a challenging task if you are not familiar with the platform's structure.
even for experienced coders who are new to wordpress, making modifications to themes can be quite time-consuming.
many free wordpress themes and plugins lack updates and support, which can lead to challenges in maintaining functionality when the wordpress platform is updated.
another drawback of using wordpress is its susceptibility to security issues.
due to its open-source nature and widespread usage, wordpress is a common target for cyber attackers.
even small websites running on wordpress can be easily found and targeted by hackers.
they can also identify security vulnerabilities and flaws, rendering these websites more prone to being hacked.
given the frequent instances of wordpress websites being compromised, users need to regularly update versions, patches, or plugins to bolster security.
while the process is quick, it can be frustrating when you prefer to set up and not worry about them in order to concentrate on other tasks.
some professional blogs that have several authors and editors may struggle with wordpress's limited user management and role division features.
while wordpress multisite plugins and customized management roles can help address this issue, they may not match the efficiency of a content management system (cms) with more advanced built-in functions.

many experts suggest that zippers may be one of the initial mechanical devices individuals become adept at handling during childhood, a skill that continues to be utilized throughout their lifetime.
while some may not consider a zipper to be a machine, it does meet the necessary criteria as it involves interconnected metal or plastic components that work together to move and require force for proper operation.
additionally, zippers have a fascinating history.
multiple attempts were made to introduce zippers as a common feature in adult clothing, which finally succeeded in 1937 with the inclusion of zippers in men's attire.
this breakthrough came about when the duke of windsor expressed his desire for trousers with zippers, leading to widespread acceptance by tailors worldwide.
the zipper rapidly became a well-known and favored fastening device, quickly expanding its use to various items such as hunting jackets, trousers, and overshoes.
the public embraced zippers for their discreet, reliable, and convenient functionality, leading to a significant rise in their popularity, with over 20 percent of men's clothing incorporating zippers by 1938.
eventually, only a minority resisted the trend of wearing clothing with zippers.
in 1939, the annual production of zippers had reached over 300 million, which was twice the amount from the preceding two years.
by 1950, the yearly sales of zippers exceeded one billion dollars.
initially, zippers were crafted by the first manufacturers from durable metals like brass, aluminum, and nickel, making them ideal for heavy fabrics.
however, as their popularity grew, the production shifted towards plastic zippers which were more flexible, gentle, and simple to care for.
today, zippers are available in a wide range of materials including colored metallic options, coils, and others.
at this point, be prepared for a new concept.
typically, i would recommend looking into online opportunities, especially considering the theme of this article.
former president donald trump is being considered for a second term, but trump's key supporters are distancing themselves from him, as he tends to react aggressively towards perceived betrayals.
the republican party had a reputation for being principled and dignified until the influence of donald trump changed its direction, ushering in a more authoritarian approach.
trump's presidency was tarnished by unethical actions for which he faced no repercussions.
the united states has strong defenses against external threats, but there is concern about who will protect the country from internal threats, specifically referring to trump.
his actions are seen as treasonous crimes against the nation, and he should be held accountable for breaking the law like any other criminal.
following his presidency, thomas kallistel and his family resided in a three-room flat.
curious about the changes in their life post-presidency, he asked his wife about the notable differences.
she mentioned that their relationship with the neighbors had changed, with people avoiding interactions.
upon further inquiry, the neighbors expressed discomfort due to the presence of official protocol vehicles during the mornings and evenings.
the examples mentioned indicate that a country can advance when its leaders serve as positive role models for the citizens and actively contribute to the nation's growth.
this, in turn, inspires people to emulate similar behaviors and traits.
if our leaders view themselves as public servants rather than as dictators, they have the potential to make positive changes for the benefit of the public.
when walker was based in norfolk, virginia, he faced financial difficulties and eventually started providing information to the soviets that enabled them to decode encrypted messages.
the scheme began with his visit to the soviet embassy in washington.
in the early 1970s, john enlisted the help of a friend and naval radio operator to provide classified encrypted information to walker that the soviets were eager to obtain.
he expanded his espionage network by involving his elder brother, who owned a struggling car radio business, and persuading him to work for a navy contractor to gain access to confidential files.
afterward, walker approached his son michael, who was an archivist for a fighter squadron in virginia beach and later served on the aircraft carrier nimitz.
walker persuaded him to take secret documents and hide them covertly under his clothing.
walker and his accomplices collected a significant volume of data, which included details about modifications done to us submarines that assisted the soviets in enhancing their own fleet.
certain confidential records also enabled the soviets to monitor the movements of american submarines and vessels.
the illegal actions of the walker spy group were eventually disclosed to authorities by john's former spouse barbara crowley, who discovered damning evidence in john's drawer.
she stated she was unaware of her son's participation.
the walker case resulted in the creation of several books and documentaries, as well as changes in the department of defense's methods for safeguarding classified data.
after the spy ring was uncovered, regulations were implemented to limit the individuals with permission to access confidential military material.
the convictions from the walker case also spurred the development of various counterintelligence efforts.
being a fast reader is advantageous when you have to go through the extensive volume of agenda material that you are likely to encounter.
do you have a family, or a family who is willing to give up their time to be with you?
unfortunately, some highly qualified candidates choose not to apply because the salary offered does not meet their financial requirements.
travel expenses and meals are typically included as part of the compensation.
you must determine if the return being offered will meet your requirements.
initially, you may experience rejection if you don't get elected.
but if you do get elected, you will encounter even more rejection.
it is advisable to authentically identify your reasons for running for local government before nominating yourself.
this does not mean that you cannot change course, but you must understand the process and timing for making adjustments.
it is important to have a supportive network of allies who share your goals.
if your intentions are driven by personal gain, you must be ready to face scrutiny and criticism from the public, as there are always observers evaluating your actions.
without clearly defined wishes and a budget in the ltp update, it becomes difficult to make any changes during the following years.
i suggest watching the british comedy series yes minister before getting involved in government, as it accurately portrays the workings of the local government system.
a large number of individuals are upset and annoyed by the gesture of a fist bump between us president joe biden and saudi arabian crown prince mohammed bin salman.
upon reaching saudi arabia, president biden warmly reciprocated the crown prince's welcoming gesture.
many individuals in saudi arabia view this individual as a foe since they hold him accountable for journalist khashoggi's death.
the woman khashoggi intended to marry expressed her frustration on social media platforms, such as twitter, regarding president biden's friendly exchange with the saudi crown prince.
president joe biden maintains that he does not feel remorse for his trip to saudi arabia, during which discussions took place regarding regional security and the request for increased oil supply from the country.
in yesterday's news report on july 14, 2022, it was reported that ivana trump passed away.
she was discovered unconscious at the foot of the stairs in her manhattan residence in new york city.
ivana trump was declared deceased at the location.
an ohio investigator found that jayland walker's body had been struck by gunfire 46 times.
eight police officers in ohio shot at jayland walker, a 25-year-old african american man during a pursuit following an attempted traffic stop.
walker was not carrying any weapons when he got out of his car and started running.
the officers claim they started shooting when walker stopped running and faced them.
after a mass shooting carried out by white supremacist peyton gendrin at a tops supermarket, where ten black people were killed, the store has now reopened.
gendrin targeted the supermarket to harm as many black individuals as possible and has been indicted on 27 hate crime charges.
recent russian assaults have targeted civilians in ukraine, with the city of dnipro in eastern ukraine being the most recent location affected.
furthermore, it is important to consider that resorting to terrorism as a means to achieve any agenda is not acceptable.
the use of violence or illegal methods to gain advantages goes against the societal norms and values.
terrorist attacks do not lead to effective or immediate results; instead, they heighten international tensions and perpetuate a cycle of violence between countries.
rather than turning to peaceful approaches, it is more constructive to seek transnational solutions that promote international solidarity.
for instance, utilizing media platforms due to their widespread influence can effectively convey messages and opinions globally.
unlike acts of terrorism, which damage credibility and cause skepticism, peaceful strategies can garner more support and understanding.
as seen with hamas, the use of suicide bombings led to its classification as a terrorist group, whereas it was initially considered a political entity in palestine.
in conclusion, regardless of the reasons, resorting to terrorism is unethical and unjustifiable.
it is possible that she is simply experiencing poverty in a society that actively works against the well-being of the poor, and her response is reasonable given the circumstances.
that is what the monarchial and the only supreme governing principle require me to do.
and society chooses to do this due to their inconvenience, rather than for reasons of justice.
perhaps offering her a new opportunity might prove beneficial for both her and society, instead of simply discarding her due to the inconvenience she poses.
the coronation oath requires every monarch of the united kingdom to ensure that law and justice are carried out with mercy and discretion in all their decisions.
as a supporter of monarchy addressing fellow supporters, it is important to consider if we should also uphold the same values and standards that monarchs do if we expect others to embrace monarchy in its entirety.
i'm not going to inquire about the angry crowd's opinion on whether it is fair to set fire to the witch.
however, in this case, the crown prevails, and i have decided to select divine and sovereign mercy.
nevertheless, the reserve militia is always excluded from their conversations.
i think it is the right moment for upstanding individuals who volunteer for the reserve militia to unite with their local police and reclaim their communities.
the multitude of unfavorable circumstances resulted in a significant movement of the extensive unemployed labor force.
consider the hardships faced by isolated women in a society struggling with poverty and natural calamities.
however, the women of this region were no longer resigned to a life of constant sorrow.
recognizing the importance of their earnings for their families' well-being, they decided to break free from the constraints imposed by outdated customs and traditions.
they began engaging energetically in the economic ventures of the country.
since the 1990s, women have played a significant role in the agricultural sector of underdeveloped countries experiencing food scarcity.
approximately 80 percent of these women were involved in agriculture as part-time workers, farmers, or tenants.
despite their substantial economic contributions, they were not recognized or supported by the patriarchal society.
in 1998, international assistance poured in following the floods, leading to the establishment of various foreign non-government organizations in the country.
the external aid received by bangladesh during this period is a significant aspect of this story.
it may seem unusual for someone who is typically on the move to suddenly engage in the mundane task of bookkeeping.
however, this individual ultimately decided to settle down and pursue this profession when they established an office in manhattan, which happened to be in the same building as a printer named samuel adams.
the issue with this account is that it relies solely on the perspective of the combatant who survived, as the other party involved, adams, was unable to provide his own version of events.
murderers encounter difficulties in disposing of the body of the victim.
some use acid baths, bury the body deep in a forest or under the floor of a coal cellar.
burning the body is also attempted, but bones are incredibly resilient to fire.
nonetheless, a storm delayed the departure of the kalamazoo and allowed suspicions to fall on john colt regarding adams' disappearance.
witnesses remembered a cartman picking up a sizable crate from colt's residence, leading to the crate being traced to the kalamazoo.
authorities then searched the ship and uncovered a disturbing find.
he had a comfortable bed to sleep in while other prisoners had to make do with a pile of straw.
he was permitted to have numerous visitors, including his pregnant girlfriend caroline henshaw, who brought him flowers and a caged canary.
there were a few unsuccessful efforts to sneak him out of the prison disguised as a woman, but the sharp-eyed guards thwarted the attempts, possibly because they had not been bribed adequately to ignore the situation.
several prison guards escaped, taking several inmates with them, leading to chaos within the facility.
however, despite the commotion, the scheduled execution continued as planned.
caroline colt has disappeared, leading to speculation from conspiracy theorists.
some believe that someone else may have been used as a decoy for colt during the chaos of the fire at the tombs, allowing her to escape unnoticed.
the absence of usn and nato forces in the black sea may be perceived as a signal to putin that the usn will rarely patrol the region due to concerns about provoking russia.
this reflects biden's hesitance to further antagonize russia, as seen in his decision to block ukrainian aircraft from poland following putin's nuclear threat.
putin is exploiting biden's reluctance to escalate the situation to gain an advantage in the conflict.
an issue in managing access to the black sea involves turkey, a semi-nato member with control over the black sea based on an outdated treaty.
turkey dictates which ships can enter the black sea, influencing shipping traffic through congested straits.
despite its nato status, turkey's close relationship with russia is problematic, as they collaborate on various issues in the middle east and north africa.
this alliance with russia complicates turkey's reliability as a nato ally, often positioning it against other member nations.
therefore, turkey's actions primarily serve its own interests, offering limited value to nato.
russia is currently disposing of 25 tons of ukrainian grain stored in silos and warehouses in the odessa region.
it is believed that they have misappropriated some of the grain and sold it to african countries.
in addition to this, russia has taken measures to impede ukraine's grain exports by blockading the main ports and placing mines offshore.
in response, ukraine has also deployed mines to prevent russia from utilizing those ports.
while the danger is significant, choosing inaction would only serve to align with putin's strategic objectives.
if turkey declines to disclose the vessels present in the convoy heading to the black sea, it may be necessary to void this obsolete treaty and allow the ships to pass through.
in order to address the issue of mass shootings, it is important to engage in a constructive conversation about firearms.
while everyone has the right to self-defense, there should be limitations on access to military-style weaponry for ordinary citizens.
questioning the necessity of owning fully automatic weapons that can rapidly fire large amounts of rounds is crucial.
the thought process behind possessing such powerful firearms raises concerns about the motives and targets involved.
the root of mass shootings seems to involve a dark combination of fear, hate, and evil that drives individuals to commit such despicable acts of violence.
in all countries except for the united states, mass shootings typically lead to officials implementing tighter regulations on gun ownership.
for instance, following a 1987 shooting in britain where 16 individuals were killed, semiautomatic weapons like those used in the attack were prohibited.
additionally, after a school shooting in 1996, the british government enforced a ban on most handguns.
as a result, the country now boasts one of the lowest rates of gun-related fatalities globally.
following the uvalde mass shooting, there have been at least 33 additional mass shootings in the united states, as we continue to blame each other without taking significant action.
on closer examination, the root of this issue in america appears to be the political structures supported by the filibuster, which is in urgent need of reform, rather than mental illness.
the united states experiences an unprecedented frequency of mass shootings.
despite this concerning trend, there has been a reluctance to implement stricter gun control laws.
what is hindering americans from taking swift action against these mass shootings?
how far are individuals willing to go to hold onto their military-style firearms?
are we willing to prioritize our guns over the safety of our children?
there is a fear among some gun owners that if they give up their ar-15s, the government may also target their handguns.
as russia continues to attack ukraine amid heavy casualties, equipment losses, and resistance from ukrainian guerilla tactics, the prospects of a clear victory for either side in the ongoing conflict appear slim.
the battle for a single city could drag on for weeks, if not months.
although ukraine is holding strong against russian attacks, a quick victory for russia appears unlikely.
there is a potential for russia to seize sieverodonetsk and advance into the donbas region if ukraine becomes complacent, but this scenario is not currently unfolding.
i remember a teacher in america expressing disbelief at the idea of divine right of kings, a topic he seemed unfamiliar with beyond his opinions, indicating he had not read works by proponents of the concept.
this was also part of a unique history class i attended, where we took a fresh look at topics we had previously learned about in elementary and primary school, such as the american revolution.
people generally accept the importance of republics, america's role in the world, and the positive impact of america's founding without questioning these notions.
we can explore some potential differences in the upcoming article, as i have a couple of suggestions in mind.
currently, let's contemplate the idea of something being beyond doubt and why criticizing america can lead to ridicule and being ostracized from society and academia.
it is somewhat expected that there may be differing perspectives, but it is hoped that there will be a thorough and knowledgeable grasp of the reasons for the establishment by all parties involved.
alternatively, it is important to recognize that wars are complex and not simply a matter of heroes versus villains.
in most conflicts, there are valid arguments on both sides that motivate people to fight for their beliefs and causes.
in the united states, he is viewed as a caricature, a distorted portrayal, and people seem uninterested in correcting this perception.
in my experience, even when presented with facts, they are likely to doubt or ignore them as if facts and truth hold no value.
this essentially brainwashes individuals to believe that a specific theory of war and governmental model is the ideal and only option, due to their restricted exposure.
it seems to happen intentionally when they are young, as they are developing the basic beliefs and principles that will shape their outlook on the world throughout their lives.
it is not advisable to only listen to one perspective in a debate, as it may lead to misconceptions where propaganda and bias are mistaken for truths instead of just one aspect of a broader discussion.
if the article doesn't sufficiently show one of the negative aspects of equality, the homeless may be able to provide a clearer explanation.
it requires an individual who stands out from the rest to bring about significant change in a republic.
sometimes, someone who does not conform to the norm is needed to uphold the principle of equality and make a meaningful impact.
however, the idea of equality becomes burdensome because of the unspoken and traditional disparities that people passively acknowledge as normal without questioning their irrationality or offensiveness in terms of permitting them to exist as elements in today's society.
disagreement can arise from conflicting opinions or ideas between individuals.
variances in taste and judgment can lead to disagreements, as people may not always see eye to eye.
it is common for people to feel defensive when their beliefs are challenged by others.
disagreements can intensify when individuals become emotionally invested in their own perspectives and are unwilling to compromise.
frequently, individuals supporting one position may begin to perceive those holding an opposing viewpoint as having unfavorable personal characteristics such as ignorance, lack of information, and prejudice.
as people align themselves with specific beliefs, others may be seen in a negative light based on these assumptions.
disagreeing with others can lead to negative opinions such as being perceived as unlikable, untrustworthy, and lacking in leadership qualities.
this can result in people not wanting to be friends with, include, or support those who have differing opinions.
a controversial situation arises when there is a prolonged public disagreement over conflicting opinions.
issues such as politics can intensify these disagreements and cause people to disregard opposing viewpoints.
demonstrating good listening skills shows respect and positive regard for someone even when you strongly disagree with them.
however, there are factors that contradict this story.
despite russia and ukraine having similar levels of perceived corruption, ukraine seems to be doing better than russia in terms of performance.
in the past, some russian formations have also shown strong performance.
russia has won its recent wars and its ground units performed well in conflicts such as the russo-georgian war.
in the 2014 conflict between russia and ukraine, most of the fighting was one-sided, with the russian forces demonstrating more preparedness compared to the ukrainians.
the issues related to dictatorships and war stem largely from the societies in which they originate.
nations with weak economies, internal conflicts masked by strong authoritarian leadership, and citizens who lack initiative and respect for authority will typically face challenges.
however, there are exceptions, such as populist dictatorships that rally their people around war efforts, maintain strong military support, and possess adequate resources for warfare.
while generally wealthier and more developed countries tend to adopt democratic systems, there are instances where affluent democracies also engage in conflicts.
democracies, like dictatorships, can be susceptible to internal discord that can contribute to their downfall in war, as evidenced by historical examples such as france in 1940 as depicted in marc bloch's etrange defaite.
having some statistics at hand can help in grasping the current energy landscape.
russia stands as the world's third-largest oil producer, following the us and saudi arabia.
the european union relies significantly on russia for its supply of crude oil, natural gas, and solid fossil fuels, with almost two-thirds of additional eu crude oil sourced from russia in 2019.
moreover, a separate analysis indicated that russia accounts for approximately three-quarters of the eu's natural gas imports.
although the uk and the us are less reliant on russian gas, it is evident that the eu relies heavily on it.
prior to the conflict, there was an assumption that ukrainians would embrace their russian counterparts as equal members of a shared community.
this mistaken belief played a significant role in the failure of the invasion.
prior to the conflict, it was believed that ukrainians would readily welcome their fellow russians as equal members of a unified group.
this mistaken belief was a key factor in the failure of the invasion.
prior to the conflict in ukraine, russia had six fundamental pillars that supported its position as a significant global power.
another falsehood put forth by mr.
lieberman is his assertion that all negative events occurred after biden assumed office, disregarding that biden wasn't president in april 2020 and the trump administration had already implemented two stimulus packages involving increased spending before biden's inauguration.
the only truthful point in his statement was the impact of the russian invasion on energy price hikes.
in this article, we will explore the mandapeshwar caves through a virtual tour.
these caves are ancient rock-cut structures with a rich history, located in the bustling dahisar suburb of mumbai.
the large rectangular cave, carved into rock, features a spacious area at the front known as the mandapa, supported by ornate stone columns.
the walls showcase relief artwork, although many have deteriorated and are challenging to decipher.

the abbey's church was repurposed as a local parish church, where the book of kells was preserved.
in his topographia hibernica, written in the 12th century, gerald of wales mentioned encountering a magnificent gospel book in kildare that is often believed to be the book of kells.
the details provided by gerald closely resemble those of the book of kells.
the book of kells includes the content of the four gospels inspired by the vulgate but not an exact replica.
it shows discrepancies from the vulgate, employing old latin translations instead of jerome's.
while these variations are prevalent in all insular gospels, there is no uniformity in the alterations among the different texts.
it appears that the scribes relied more on memory than their source material when transcribing the text.
the text from the gospel of john written in insular majuscule by the scribe called hand b can be found on folio 309r.
the boydell shakespeare gallery, located in london, was the first phase of a project started by john boydell in 1786 to promote british history painting.
alongside the gallery, boydell also intended to create an illustrated version of shakespeare's plays and a set of prints inspired by contemporary artists' paintings.
by the 1790s, the london gallery showcasing the original paintings became the most successful aspect of the project.

beato, an experienced photographer who had documented military events in india and china, likely found the news of the annexation intriguing.
although he arrived in burma post the major military operations, he had the opportunity to witness ongoing action due to the british annexation leading to a prolonged insurgency.
during this time, beato captured numerous images of british military activities around the royal palace in mandalay, as well as the insurgents, and prisoners.
beato established a photo studio in mandalay and, by 1894, had also started a business selling unique items and antiques, managing both enterprises independently and reportedly achieving great success based on historical documents.
his extensive background and the trust he gained while in japan attracted many wealthy locals who wanted official portraits in traditional clothing.
additionally, he sold various images, including buddhas and landscapes, from high-quality albums in both burma and europe.
in 1896, trench gascoigne showed some of beato's images in the book among pagodas and fair ladies.
the next year, picturesque burma by mrs.
ernest hart featured more of beato's photos, and george w.
bird in wanderings in burma not only included thirty-five credited photographs but also described beato's businesses extensively and suggested visitors visit his shop.
at that point, beato's photos had become the synonymous representation of burma worldwide and continued as such for many years.

the figures are painted in a stylized, abstract way rather than in a realistic manner.
brettingham was born in norwich to a family of craftsmen and started his career as a surveyor.
he gained experience working on various projects for the city's civic authorities, such as restorations at norwich cathedral, the castle, the local prison, and the shire hall.
his career took off in 1743 when he was appointed as the clerk of works at holkham.
over the following years, he received numerous commissions from aristocratic clients, mostly in east anglia, with notable work also at kedleston hall in derbyshire.
archaeal cells exhibit distinctive characteristics that distinguish them from bacteria and eukaryota.
within the archaea domain, there are various recognized phyla.
due to the challenge of isolating many archaea in a lab setting, classification is complex, often relying on gene sequences from environmental samples.
it remains uncertain whether these archaeal organisms have the capability to form endospores.
there are various configurations of bacterial flagella: a-monotrichous; b-lophotrichous; c-amphitrichous; d-peritrichous.
they explored western areas like colorado, nebraska, and wyoming in search of fossils.
between 1877 and 1892, the paleontologists funded their expeditions and acquired dinosaur bones from fossil hunters.
at the end of the bone wars, their finances were drained as they sought dominance in the field of paleontology.
in 1896, marsh created a drawing showcasing the skeletal structure of stegosaurus, a dinosaur that he had identified and named in 1877.
different types of equipment can be used in cooperative pulling experiments.
in 1937, researcher meredith crawford created an apparatus with two ropes connected to a heavy rolling platform that required more than one chimpanzee to pull.
the typical setup involves a single string threaded through loops on a mobile platform, challenging participants to work together to succeed.
some variations use handles instead of ropes.
success in these experiments typically requires coordinated effort rather than happenstance.
regarding the development of cooperation, research on cooperative pulling tests indicates that cooperation likely originated multiple times on its own.
the fact that fundamental cooperative behaviors are observed in certain mammals and birds suggests a scenario of convergent evolution.
in social animals, cooperation is believed to be a product of cognitive adaptation.

the reason for the sudden increase in interest rates was initially unknown.
however, economists later determined that a primary factor was a temporary lack of available cash in the financial system, resulting from two events occurring on september 16: the deadline for corporate tax payments and the issuance of new treasury securities.
this shortage was worsened by a decrease in reserves in the banking system.
additional factors that may have played a role have been proposed by economists and observers.

when brookwood cemetery finally opened in late 1854, it faced competition from newer cemeteries closer to london.
despite initial expectations of handling thousands of burials annually, the cemetery never reached those numbers, conducting only 231,730 burials in its first 150 years.
high costs of acquiring the land and constructing the cemetery and railway pushed the london necropolis company (lnc) towards bankruptcy.
while the lnc managed to stay afloat by selling some of its land, the chosen remote location limited the success of these sales.
starting in the 1880s, the lnc adopted a more assertive strategy to increase its revenue.
by enhancing the process for selling surplus land, the organization experienced a rise in profits.
a notable achievement was the transformation of its hook heath property into a residential area and golf course, contributing to the establishment of a new neighborhood in woking and generating a stable income through lease agreements.
furthermore, following a 1884 legal decision permitting cremation in england, the lnc leveraged its proximity to woking crematorium by offering transportation services for bodies and mourners on its railway line, and later, from 1910 onwards, by providing a designated area for storing ashes.
the lnc was also instrumental in providing land for several significant military burial grounds and memorials at brookwood after both world wars.
unfortunately, during wwii in 1941, the london necropolis railway station, which served as the lnc's london terminal, was severely damaged in a bombing raid, leading to the discontinuation of the london necropolis railway service.

diamond is a crystalline form of carbon with a diamond cubic structure, while another form, graphite, is more stable at standard temperature and pressure.
despite being metastable, diamond is known for its exceptional hardness and thermal conductivity, making it useful in various industrial applications like cutting tools.
due to these properties, diamond anvil cells can replicate high pressures similar to those found deep within the earth.
diamond's exceptional hardness in specific directions is valuable for materials science applications, such as the use of a pyramidal diamond in the surface of a vickers hardness tester.
diamonds remain unchanged when exposed to various chemicals such as strong acids and bases at room temperature.
incredibly uncommon purple glowing diamonds from the ellendale l-channel mine in australia.
diamonds are commonly used today as both decorative gemstones and industrial abrasives for cutting tough materials.
gem-grade and industrial-grade diamonds are valued differently in their respective markets.
a big pink rectangular gem is placed within an ornate setting.
the setting features a row of small transparent gems encircling the main gem, as well as groupings of gems creating a design on one side.
this design includes a three-pointed crown and two unidentified creatures.
the hardness and cleaving strength of a diamond are heavily influenced by its crystal orientation.
to identify the best cutting directions, the crystallographic structure of the diamond is examined using x-ray diffraction.
the majority of diamonds have noticeable imperfections and flaws that are not made of diamond.
it is up to the cutter to determine which imperfections should be eliminated during cutting and which ones can be left untouched.
there are six cubo-octahedral shaped crystals, each measuring around 2 millimeters in diameter.
among them, two are light blue, one is a pale yellow, one is a green-blue, one is a dark blue, and one is a green-yellow.

we would like to express our gratitude to dr.
simone muench for her generosity in providing refreshments, arranging the digital projection of the jet fuel review site, and for taking time out of her hectic schedule to attend the reading.
additionally, our thanks go to tonya peterson for promptly organizing refreshments at the last minute.
what to steer clear of: relying solely on a proofreader.
while proofreading is valuable, addressing higher-level concerns during the editing process is crucial.
issues like character development, plot coherence, and other macroscopic elements should take priority.
shifting a comma on one page won't resolve fundamental problems such as inconsistent characters or unresolved plotlines.
therefore, it's advisable to save proofreading for later stages of the process.
if you have a proofreader available, consider involving them in the later rounds of manuscript review.
steve papesh, an education major and chinese minor at lewis university, has written this post.
he is currently interning with the jet fuel review and will be adding blog posts from time to time.
for many novice writers, the idea of being able to write as a full-time career seems like a distant fantasy that we think about when we're not working for our boss or finding ways to procrastinate.
how do experienced writers manage to transition from being a part-time dreamer to a full-time author?
after completing your writing, mcduling suggests focusing on promoting it as the next step.
he emphasizes that around 50% of your effort should be dedicated to marketing your work.
this is because the quality of your writing won't matter if it remains unseen by others.
in a similar practical approach, mcduling emphasizes the importance of writers understanding the preferences of editors.
like professionals in any field, writers must be aware of their audience, meet deadlines, and maintain a professional approach to their work.
identify a safe and inspiring environment where you can cultivate your creativity.
dedicate regular time each week to be in this setting, as it will help your ideas to develop and be expressed effectively.
while it may require some patience, consistent visits to this conducive space are essential for nurturing your thoughts and bringing them to life.
steve posted in the community discussion on tuesday to discuss the challenge of being labelled as a certain type of writer.
continuously writing in the same genre can lead to assumptions about a writer.
steve prompts readers to consider how they can move beyond perceived genre constraints and explores the advantages of experimenting with new writing styles.

a person who finds comfort in their homeland is considered inexperienced; someone who feels at home anywhere has attained strength; while the ultimate achievement is when one sees the whole world as unfamiliar.
a beginner attaches their affection to a specific place, a strong individual extends their love to all locations, and a perfect person has overcome all attachments.
according to the hosts, a key characteristic of urban fantasy involves uncovering the hidden truths about real-life elements or crafting explanations for urban myths and legends.
for example, proposing an extraterrestrial origin for a well-known monument in washington, dc would be considered a prime example of urban fantasy storytelling.
as the podcast ended, the hosts of writing excuses recognized the depth of topics still left to be discussed in urban fantasy.
therefore, they announced a future episode dedicated to providing more guidance on the genre.
this upcoming discussion is eagerly anticipated by many, myself included.
at some stage in their lives, many americans undergo a self-reflective process where they ponder their identity and religious beliefs.
this may involve exploring various faiths in search of what resonates most with them and aligns with their worldview.
one aspect of the text that intrigued me was goodman brown's preoccupation with how others, such as goody cloyse, perceive his faith.
his deep concern stemmed from his reliance on the religious beliefs and actions of his community members to shape his own.
by placing greater importance on the faith of those around him rather than his own convictions, goodman brown's faith becomes fragile and susceptible to influence.
another way we could become stagnant in our writing is by limiting ourselves to a single genre simply because we have been praised for our work in that genre.
for instance, i tend to gravitate towards humorous and surreal writing, but confining oneself to a single genre may prevent a writer from venturing into new territories and exploring unfamiliar genres.
hence, these narratives explore the concepts of uncertainty and the prevalent american theme of discovering one's true self through ventures into unfamiliar territories within american literary tradition.
the notion of beginning anew and establishing a sense of belonging in a different setting, whether it is within a fresh social circle or physical location, signifies the challenge of discovering and maintaining one's authentic identity after delving into one's innermost thoughts and feelings.

the hosts discussed the number of edits that a typical book undergoes, with an average of six edits suggested by the panel.
one host mentioned doing three edits, citing boredom and a dislike for the editing process.
however, it is recommended to seek feedback and additional edits from other individuals to gain fresh perspectives.
outsourcing editing tasks to friends and fellow writers can help provide new insights and improve the quality of the work.
this proposal is supported by major ngos like oxfam, save the children and one, as well as business figures such as mark moody-stuart, the previous leader of the oil company shell.
they endorse a cost-effective measure that would offer companies important insights into their business associates.
revealing the true owners and controllers of companies through transparency measures will bring illicit funds and concealed identities to light, ultimately aiding in the reduction of corruption and tax evasion that contribute to the ongoing poverty in less developed nations.
the civil wars that devastated west africa in the 1990s, driven by valuable resources like diamonds and timber, have come to an end.
however, countries like liberia, sierra leone, and angola are now working to use their resource wealth effectively to uplift their current populations out of poverty while also protecting the environment.
despite progress, natural resources continue to be a source of conflict and instability in countries such as the democratic republic of congo, cambodia, and central african republic.
uganda is at a crucial point in its progress, as it anticipates significant financial gain from its emerging oil, gas, and mining industries.
if managed effectively, this could lead to a substantial improvement in the living standards of its people.
however, there is a risk that it may also foster corruption and empower a controlling elite.
safeguarding fundamental rights and liberties is essential to prevent the negative impact of the resource curse that has harmed many other african nations.
the implementation of the lacey act and the european timber regulation has compelled chinese wood product manufacturers to take legality concerns into account when exporting to the us and europe.
despite this, most timber imported into china is used to meet the increasing needs of the domestic market.
to curb the influx of illegal timber imports on a larger scale, the chinese government will likely need to establish its own regulatory measures.
it is proposed that the chinese government implement laws that ban the importation of illegally sourced timber.
this measure would safeguard chinese businesses operating lawfully, assist exporters in adhering to regulations in the us and eu, and help preserve forests in countries where the timber is sourced.
additionally, it would provide chinese customs and other authorities with the authority to take action against illegally obtained timber imports, which they currently lack the ability to do.
during the suifenhe conference, various parties, such as global witness, ikea, and the director of the suifenhe customs authority, all agreed on the need for china to implement laws that would prohibit the import of illegal timber.
global witness is advocating for the elimination of anonymous companies.
they are calling for countries to establish public registers that reveal the true individuals who own and oversee companies and trusts.
these awards will greatly accelerate our progress, enabling us to carry on with our research, highlight important issues, and initiate powerful campaigns that question entrenched powers and drive systemic change.
hagl operates extensive plantations in southern laos, where local communities have faced issues such as human rights abuses, deforestation, and food shortages.
despite recent instances of arrests and the disappearance of a key figure in lao civil society, international and local ngos are feeling overwhelmed by the pressure to aid affected communities and file a complaint with the ifc.
the cases of dinant and hagl reveal the ifc's lack of ability to monitor the destinations of its finances and intervene in case of failures.
this situation prompts significant concerns about the ifc's effectiveness in determining whether its funds are positively or negatively impacting development.
the peace process provides a chance for south sudanese leaders to start repairing the rifts, but they need to demonstrate a genuine commitment to translating promises into tangible actions.
the south sudan government needs to make concrete pledges to enforce oil laws promptly, while aid donors ought to leverage their influence to prevent ongoing delays in legislation.
both parties should involve governors from oil-producing regions in discussions about oil management and push for anti-corruption initiatives.
ultimately, it is crucial for the government of south sudan to focus on ensuring the safety of civilians as well as protecting the oilfields.
intense conflict in regions like unity and upper nile, combined with widespread misconduct by government troops, has resulted in many survivors suffering and being exposed to risks.
the excessive presence of military forces has also increased the potential for more human rights violations, displacements, and a worsening of the overall instability in the areas.
if transactions were conducted transparently, many negative consequences could be prevented.
communities would have visibility on who was interested in purchasing their land and the potential impacts.
this would facilitate seeking compensation and ensuring accountability if lease terms were violated.
governments could more effectively evaluate the societal and environmental implications of land transactions.
essentially, regulating land trades similar to other industries could lead to better outcomes for all stakeholders.
although we have not reached this point yet, assistance is available.
in 2012, a report titled dealing with disclosure was published by global witness, the international land coalition, and the oakland institute.

global witness began advocating for the abolition of anonymous companies in 2009 through a report named undue diligence: how banks do business with corrupt regimes.
the report presented various instances of banks engaging with corrupt regimes, leading to detrimental effects like poverty and conflict.
many of these cases involved the utilization of companies with undisclosed ownership.
it became evident that anonymous companies were prevalent in facilitating illicit activities such as fraud, tax evasion, sanctions violations, clandestine oil and mining agreements, as well as deceptive practices like passing off horsemeat as beef.
certainly, there are companies with extremely intricate international setups where the legal ownership and actual beneficial ownership are distinct, and where enterprises are ultimately controlled by a cascade of subsidiaries in various countries, resembling a set of nested russian dolls.
it may be uncomfortable for cameron and his team to learn that schwarzenegger was discovered to be one of the owners of an investment firm funding large-scale deforestation, just two weeks before the debut of years of living dangerously.
the government's resistance is not just directed towards the media.
in september last year, police and security forces of a company assaulted 17 individuals from grand bassa county who were protesting against the encroachment of equatorial palm oil plantation on their land.
likewise, in february, two individuals from sinoe county were detained for inquiring about the golden veroleum palm oil plantation expansion.
additionally, during the same month, a community leader lost his government position for organizing meetings where locals discussed complaints about a logging company working in their forest.
the government has made significant progress in enhancing the management of natural resources, partly due to the efforts of liberian civil society organizations.
in february, the ministry of justice charged eight former officials for their role in authorizing illegal logging licenses, an issue first exposed by research from liberian ngos and global witness.
additionally, the president recently responded to community protests against the equatorial palm oil plantation by agreeing that the company would not expand onto their land without community consent.
recognizing the value of effective natural resource management has long been acknowledged in development policy.
despite continuous references to the importance of transparency and accountability by officials, significant technical assistance efforts can be easily compromised by corrupt practices.
unfortunately, dedicated and well-informed aid initiatives focused on this matter remain limited in availability.
the gpedc meeting offers a significant chance to tackle this issue in coordinating development efforts.
it presents an opportunity to gather some of the most powerful individuals globally to support a fresh and improved approach to managing natural resources.
if governments truly want to utilize aid to eradicate poverty, they must publicly address and commit to addressing the issue.
this is an opportune moment to take meaningful action towards this goal.
in fact, the situation of determining the beneficiaries in the marange region has become so perplexing that even the zimbabwean government seems to be uncertain about it.
certain companies have denied being aware of the trust, while others have acknowledged making much smaller commitments.
a public dispute has emerged involving the former minister of youth, indigenisation and economic empowerment, as well as mines and mining development, accusing some diamond companies of dishonesty regarding the agreements made.
influential individuals and their advocates are minimizing the dangers and persuading people that items such as fossil fuels and tropical timber are essential to the global economy.
as a result, despite increasing concerns about the negative consequences, we persist on this course of action.
governments need to take action now.
in december, officials will meet in lima, peru for the next climate talks.
if they don't shift their recent habits and take strong steps to safeguard the environment and those most depending on it, we will be faced with the consequences of their lack of action in terms of human lives and escalating costs.
the un declaration on human rights defenders acknowledges the significance and validity of individuals who advocate for human rights and emphasizes the necessity for enhanced protection for these individuals.
environmental defenders stand out by connecting concerns about health, life, and freedom from injustice to the safeguarding of the environment that supports them.
vietnam is not facing this challenge alone and can look to several governments that have taken steps to protect their companies from similar risks outside their own country.
a) follow the laws and regulations of the host country related to protecting the environment and promoting social welfare.
acknowledge and uphold the cultural background of local communities, engage in consultations, and provide crucial project details to potentially affected individuals following the globally recognized principle of freely given, prior, and informed consent.
conduct thorough evaluations of environmental and social impacts before finalizing contracts and halt projects if the identified negative impacts are deemed significant.
conduct thorough research on potential local partners to assess their history of environmental and social responsibility, as well as their integrity regarding corruption.
the case has prompted investigations by authorities in the uk, italy, and nigeria due to the significant corruption concerns it has brought to light.
this situation holds great potential as both companies and governments are supporting it.
however, a significant obstacle arises from a few major oil companies who consistently use familiar arguments to oppose or dilute the legislation.
shell is the primary entity that is blocking the proposed laws in the eu to maintain the current situation.
the company's lobbyists have been actively working to make changes that would keep the types of payments they made in nigeria confidential.
in the uk, shell is persisting in its efforts to delay the implementation of the eu directive, even though it is a binding law and supported by the prime minister on a global stage.
despite claims by shell and other oil companies, eu member states do not have the authority to modify the directive.
nonetheless, it is anticipated that oil lobbyists will continue to advocate for postponements.
given the high stakes involved, shell should disclose the full extent of their knowledge regarding the destination of funds related to opl 245.
furthermore, they should discontinue their efforts to undermine legislation in the us that mandates transparency in such payments.
in application, this can involve carrying out relatively straightforward actions.
our report released three weeks ago revealed a significant rise in the killings of environmental activists, drawing widespread attention from the international media, with coverage on prominent platforms such as the huffington post, al jazeera, the guardian, tv globo, and more.
the findings of the report were astounding.
we have numerous other cases that could be improved by utilizing the same approach, and we intend to apply this strategy to more cases in the future.
there is hope for our forests as we can take steps to protect them.
it is crucial to challenge and dispel the myths perpetuated by the logging industry.
instead of viewing forests as mere sources of profit through logging, we should recognize them as vital resources that need safeguarding on a global scale.
implementing the recommendations outlined in the 2014 africa progress panel report, such as reducing the demand for products contributing to deforestation, eliminating hidden subsidies for logging, and enforcing stricter oversight of private forest financing, will be essential.
ultimately, power should be returned to forest communities by acknowledging their land rights and promoting sustainable, community-driven forest management practices.
the frequency of killings of forest and land defenders, such as wutty, is increasing.
our research from various sources shows that on average, two individuals who defend forests and land are being murdered every week.
among the victims are environmental activists, as well as regular individuals residing on land deemed valuable.
the wall street journal and uk human rights organization raid recently disclosed that och-ziff capital management group, a us hedge fund, has been a significant financial supporter of dan gertler, a businessman involved in contentious mining transactions in the democratic republic of congo.
the disclosure by och-ziff highlights that the transactions in the congo were assisted by significant actors in prominent financial centers like new york and london, frequently conducted via subsidiaries based in locations known for their financial confidentiality, such as the british virgin islands.
it illustrates how the privacy and financial advantages offered by these jurisdictions have been exploited to divert vast amounts of money from some of the most economically disadvantaged nations globally.
revealing the true owners of companies to the public would aid in identifying the beneficiaries of natural resource transactions.
it is no longer permissible for undisclosed company ownership to benefit a select few secretive entities and individuals at the cost of the general populace.
in march, och-ziff disclosed that it is being investigated by us authorities regarding its investments in africa; the inquiry is expected to provide more insight into these transactions and requires the cooperation of offshore financial centers.
another recommendation offered by the hosts is to prioritize the cover design and maintain a high level of professionalism when showcasing your work online.
since the cover will appear small on platforms like amazon, it is crucial to select an impactful image that can capture attention and generate interest in the book.
to ensure a strong visual appeal, it is advisable to seek assistance from individuals knowledgeable in graphic design.
some readers on boingboing expressed concern that the post was not showing sensitivity towards the devastating human losses in japan.
despite this, the sight of books floating and shelves submerged evoked thoughts of individuals who once read those books and now may never do so again, as well as children who frequented the library and may have been impacted by the tragic events.
the use of technology in writing can either complicate or simplify the manuscript creation process.
if you revise your drafts without keeping the original rough copy, you fail to demonstrate your writing evolution to your audience, which is a tragedy as the manuscript lacks authenticity.
however, by saving your drafts and final version on a cd, writing handwritten comments on copies, and organizing them in computer and physical folders, you establish a beneficial routine that facilitates easy access and potential future publication opportunities.
store each physical folder in a filing cabinet for future reference and enhancement of your work.
firstly, i would like to mention that this image is more suitable for fiction or poetry writers.
previously, prompt wednesday focused more on non-fiction writing, but this particular image is clearly intended for fiction.
however, if this image sparks a memory that you could potentially write an essay about, then feel free to explore that angle.
in any case, here is today's picture prompt.
to conclude for today: look for fresh experiences to inspire your writing, leverage all your knowledge and past experiences in your work, and prioritize writing according to your own preferences.
while considering which subjects to feature in a university blog, many suggested that charlie sheen was the only newsworthy train wreck.
initially, i felt it was unjust to criticize sheen, but after viewing his interviews online, my perspective changed.
as a psychology student, it feels unethical to mock a substance abuser possibly dealing with psychological issues.
yet, sheen's controversial interviews hint at a level of awareness beyond addiction.
in my opinion, his behavior comes across as very strategic.
in the television industry, ratings play a crucial role in determining the success of your career.
charlie sheen, who has dealt with negative publicity in the past, has experienced fluctuations in ratings tied to his personal actions.
before the abuse allegations from his ex-wife, brooke mueller, the viewership of two and a half men was declining.
however, when the media attention intensified, the show's ratings soared.
sheen appears to be cleverly leveraging his personal controversies to enhance his celebrity status.
in a creative writing class, i had to write a poem from the perspective of a retired ballerina from broadway, despite my lack of knowledge about ballet.
reluctant at first, i dedicated time to researching ballet terminology and various works to better comprehend the art form.
despite feeling unfamiliar with the persona, i believe the poem i produced was authentic.
while i may not publish this poem, the experience has provided me with valuable insights that i can use in future writing endeavors.
knowing about concepts like pas de deux or the consequences of a torn acl ligament may come in handy at unexpected times.
conducting research enables us to expand our knowledge as individuals and, consequently, as writers.
some writers find inspiration and creativity in their dreams, and some even use them as a source for their writing.
naomi epel authored a book called writers dreaming, which explores how twenty-six writers use their dreams for inspiration and in their writing endeavors.
authors also recommend drinking before bedtime or setting an alarm to wake up multiple times during the night to jot down your dreams.
the most effective recommendation is to keep a journal near your bed and as soon as you wake up, record your dreams from the previous night before doing anything else.
by consistently doing this each morning, you will discover new material to write about.
throughout my life, libraries have been steadfast companions for me.
during my childhood, we resided just a short walk away from the neighborhood library, where i spent many summer days enjoying the small but welcoming space.
this particular library holds a special place in my heart as it was where i borrowed my first harry potter book, amidst memories of summer adventures in neon shorts, sipping orange soda, and biking to the library.
during that time, i enjoyed stacking thick, hardcover books and observing the librarian scan them with a laser scanner.
i wondered how those summer afternoons would have been different without good libraries.
what are your thoughts on libraries?
do you believe they are still relevant and vital institutions in today's world?
share any memorable library experiences you have from your childhood or recent years.
although i have a great love for books, i must admit that i do not handle them with care.
in my collection, books often acquire damaged spines, folded corners, and scribbled notes in the margins.
i engage with the content to a degree that can be considered rough.
switching to e-books on my ipad has allowed me to engage with the text extensively without causing physical wear and tear on the book.
this week, i decided to use a writing prompt from their website that caught my attention when it was published a week ago.
the prompt asks to describe a location where one would not want to live.
pinsky discusses the striking differences between sidney and dowson in his writing.
while sidney's poem features pure and gentle imagery, highlighting a young girl, dowson's work delves into the theme of prostitutes and alcohol.
pinsky notes the varying depictions of love in each poem.
both poems and audio readings by robert pinsky can be accessed on slate.
despite considering myself as a pretty aware and perceptive individual, there are occasional moments where i overlook something only to stumble upon it by chance later on.
while i have encountered several instances of this nature, a recent and particularly enjoyable example is the discovery of saskia hamilton.
i think the collaboration idea is great and i really appreciate the album.
however, you may be wondering about saskia hamilton's involvement in this.
the lesson from this story is to always explore intriguing names and information, as you may discover valuable content for your blog.
for example, a local band created an entire album inspired by buckminster fuller.
researching interesting facts can spark innovative ideas and inspire creative projects.
in honor of the 1,000 people affected by the destructive landslides and floods in the capital city less than a year before, hundreds of residents gathered on world environment day to plant a tree.
the calamity caused massive devastation, as a powerful torrent of boulders, debris, and mud swept through freetown, impacting over 6,000 individuals and causing extensive damage to vital infrastructure.
assessments for the cities of freetown, makeni, and bo are almost finished, focusing on identifying high-risk areas vulnerable to flooding, landslides, sea level rise, and coastal erosion.
the reports will offer strategies to manage these risks.
advancements in computing power and the accessibility of large datasets have enabled the development of new technologies that forecast repayment tendencies by utilizing non-traditional sources of information.
information from sources like utility bills, tax payments, work history, and even mobile phones or social media platforms like facebook are now being utilized for this purpose.
utilizing various research and development methods related to the efl score threshold, our initial focus is on assessing the impact of the efl tool on enhancing credit accessibility.
if the absence of credit data does not hinder small and medium enterprises (smes) seeking loans, those with efl scores below the threshold might secure funding from alternative sources, potentially resulting in no substantial variation in loan utilization near the efl score threshold.
additionally, in a subsequent analysis, we investigate whether smes granted loans through the efl tool demonstrate poorer repayment patterns compared to those receiving loans through traditional screening methods.
because loan applicants without credit history may find technologies like the efl tool more useful, we divide our loan applicants into two categories: those with little credit history and those with substantial credit history.
the equifax scores for applicants with substantial credit history are influenced by their past credit behavior, while scores for those with little credit history are determined by alternative sources given their lack of credit history.
to assess repayment behavior, the study examined the percentage of individuals with loan arrears exceeding 60 days in the two-year period after applying for the loan.
there was no significant difference in arrears rates between thin file applicants evaluated through the efl tool versus those assessed through traditional methods.
however, for applicants with thicker credit histories, the likelihood of facing arrears was higher when screened with the efl tool.
in general, it seems that using psychometric credit scoring is an effective means of evaluating loan applicants who lack a credit history.
these individuals have an increased likelihood of receiving loans compared to the traditional screening process, and their repayment behavior does not appear to be worse.
additionally, the study emphasizes the importance of credit bureau data, as it suggests that applicants with poor credit histories are more likely to face repayment difficulties in the future, regardless of their psychometric score.
the upcoming overview course of financial sector issues by the world bank will cover the application of psychometric tools in sme finance and related subjects.

initially, pathways for peace emphasizes the importance of preventing conflicts in order to avoid the devastating impact they have on lives.
as someone who witnesses the severe consequences of conflict on a daily basis, my government understands the necessity of shifting our approach to focus on prevention rather than response.
this shift is not only pragmatic but also morally sound.
i am hopeful that the report will inspire various stakeholders to collaborate in preventing future suffering, offering a promising outlook for somalia and the world.
additionally, the research emphasizes the need for stronger collaborations among global stakeholders to promote peace initiatives at a national level, particularly in somalia.
while the country has collaborated with various international partners, the effectiveness of their support has been hindered by inadequate coordination and integration of efforts.
next, it is important to prioritize women and youth in the same way we prioritize other crucial factors in achieving peace.
this requires providing ongoing support and resources.
an essential step is to enhance the skills and capabilities of government officials responsible for overseeing and organizing related initiatives.
efforts in this area are particularly lacking in fragile and conflict-affected nations, as noted in a recent research report by the oecd on funding assistance for gender equality.
in somalia, there are important opportunities to turn the prevention plan into reality.
the upcoming elections in 2020-21 and the ongoing constitutional review offer unique chances to create an inclusive society for future generations.
the ministry is focused on utilizing these opportunities, such as empowering diverse groups of women to work together to have their voices recognized by developing shared goals and approaches.
we have great chances to enhance collaboration among national and international entities.
working groups dedicated to each aspect of the national development plan, such as pillar 9 on human rights and gender equality, allow the government, civil society, and global partners to join forces, create unified plans, and act as advocates for more effective and forward-thinking assistance.
constance senekal, who works as a teacher, started pig farming as a means to support her family.
constance underwent training through the sadp program provided by the ministry of agriculture and food security in livestock care and product marketing.
she utilizes facebook as a platform to connect with a broader audience, finding it more effective than traditional media like radio.
when traveling through romania, you will notice a contrast between two different sides of the country.
one side is characterized by urban areas that are lively, connected with the european union, and economically prosperous.
for instance, bucharest stands out as a vibrant city with flourishing modern amenities and a higher income per person compared to the eu average.
on the flip side, the rural parts of romania tend to be less developed, impoverished, and socially disconnected.
in order to continue progressing and reach similar standards of living as those in the eu, romania will need to undertake certain adjustments.
the workforce's skills have not evolved at the same rate as the economy, which is becoming more sophisticated.
romania's export focus has shifted from labor-intensive, low-technology industries to advanced sectors like automotive, machinery, electronic equipment, and information and communication technology (ict).
romania's infrastructure is in poor condition, with the country ranking 102nd out of 137 countries in terms of transport infrastructure quality.
due to inadequate planning and ineffective public administration, romania has been unable to effectively utilize the structural funds it has received from the eu since joining.
20% of the population do not have access to clean drinking water, while 33% lack access to a flushing toilet.
the situations are even more dire for the roma community, where only 28% are employed and 70% live in poverty.
the mix of extensive maternity benefits and scarcity of part-time work opportunities has unintentionally discouraged women from joining the workforce.
gender stereotypes persist in assigning majority of child and elderly care responsibilities to women, whether they are employed or not.
a large number of workers are stuck in unproductive agriculture and informal work, resulting in inefficient use and distribution of labor.
consequently, the shift to higher-productivity jobs has been slow.
considering the many conflicting aspects, can romania still take pride in its past accomplishments?
looking back, the answer is definitely affirmative.
in just a short period, romania has established an inclusive society, strengthened its democracy, and achieved unprecedented prosperity.
in the future, romanians should be worried if the country does not fix its governance issues.
this could lead to unstable economic growth and reduced prosperity for all.
a successful and fair romania should ensure that no one is left out.
david lynch recently revealed during a radio interview that the upcoming hd reissue of his well-known 1986 movie blue velvet will feature previously thought lost footage.
lynch expressed his excitement about rediscovering these scenes, as they had not been seen since they were initially edited out.
he credited the internet as the primary reason for including these scenes in the film.
as a devoted lynch aficionado, i felt a surge of nervousness and excitement for several reasons.
firstly, my deep admiration for blue velvet gives me pause as lynch has displayed in works like mulholland dr.
and inland empire the ability for a single scene to be monumental.
i am content with blue velvet as it is and fear altering its impact on me.
this apprehension stems notably from a childhood memory of watching a commercial promoting the re-release of star wars with added scenes, a memory that still resonates with me to this day.
the guidelines for creating a cento are straightforward and this form can be a good introduction for beginners in writing.
when executed effectively, a cento can serve as a tribute to the original poet, revitalizing and enhancing the meaning of the borrowed words.
one of the presenters discussed the contrast between halloween celebrations in the united states and dia de los muertos in mexico.
it could be compelling to feature marginalized or alternative cultures in your fictional world.
i trust that this list has been beneficial to you.
just bear in mind that if you are determined to evade work, you can simply tap into your creativity.
while writing may be challenging, finding ways to dodge writing tasks can lead to an enjoyable and satisfying creative endeavor.
keep in mind that where there is a strong desire to avoid responsibilities, there is always a solution.
describe a memorable snow day from your past or create a poem or short story inspired by the current winter scene outside your window.
it's important to stay cozy indoors during this cold weather.
the impact on enrollment and attendance, as well as english test performance, was even more significant for girls who initially had the highest language skills.
experiencing poverty can often lead to a double burden.
according to kenny and sandefur's analysis, tax-transfer systems in wealthy nations help in reducing inequality but can worsen poverty in the poorest countries.
in four out of five sub-saharan african countries with ceq data, taxes and transfers were found to increase the number of individuals living in extreme poverty.
in tanzania, poverty levels are almost 20 percent higher as a result of taxes and transfers.
territorial development strategies should begin with effective institutions that provide essential services to all and facilitate economic concentration and movement of workers throughout different regions.
this involves transferring authority from central to local levels and improving coordination between sectors at all levels.
in such interventions, it is crucial to ensure that the advantages reach beyond just the communities directly linked to these corridors.
it is important to deliver various benefits to communities along economic corridors through enhanced spatial and land-use planning, improved policies and regulations, fostering private sector involvement, boosting trade and logistics capacities, creating connecting roads to major corridors from cities and small towns, and providing essential infrastructure services.
strategically pinpointed and organized actions can offer customized strategies to regions with slower economic growth and living standards.
these actions should be chosen carefully by looking at the area comprehensively and implementing a comprehensive approach that spans multiple sectors in terms of planning and funding.
by examining our methods of communication, shopping, transportation, work, and leisure activities, we can see the significant impact that technology has had on all aspects of life and commerce over the past decade.
sub-saharan africa showed its ability to utilize technology through the mobile telecom revolution in the 2000s.
there is now significant potential for a digital influence in africa.
to realize this potential, it is essential to establish the five key elements of a digital economy: digital infrastructure, education and expertise, financial services, platforms, and digital entrepreneurship and innovation.
in addition to providing access to the digital sphere, enabling individuals to verify their identities through digital identification is essential.
a significant portion of adults in sub-saharan africa, around 29 percent, lack proper identification.
this percentage is even greater among specific demographics such as women, youth, and those experiencing poverty.
implementing digital id initiatives could provide people with access to vital government services, as demonstrated by rwanda's current efforts.
enhanced digital literacy and skills are essential.
people require basic digital literacy to engage with the digital realm, while most employees need digital skills for their daily tasks.
additionally, digital entrepreneurs need specific coding abilities to establish online enterprises.
key african markets are already benefiting from efforts by major tech firms and specialized educational organizations like andela to foster these skills.
we are dedicated to supporting africa in developing its digital economy and are excited about collaborating with governments and businesses to achieve this goal.
the qualitative graph in figure 2 displays the correlation between project costs and usefulness, with project stages indicated by dots.
a red vertical line marks the point at which technology or a product attains practicality or usefulness.
only a small number of project teams are able to progress beyond this point and sustain a consistent increase in investment.
the reason for this is that many projects will demand a diverse range of resources in order to advance from the proof of concept (poc) stage to production.
activities such as field testing, engaging with user focus groups, creating new commercial-grade applications, and integrating new processes into existing technologies require specialized skills that may be lacking within the team that initially conceptualized and launched the idea to the poc stage.
entrepreneurship is common in developing countries, but most entrepreneurs struggle to expand their businesses.
various obstacles such as financial, technical, and informational challenges hinder their growth.
even when these hindrances are removed in research studies, the expected business growth does not always materialize.
furthermore, initiatives aimed at overcoming managerial and information barriers often face low participation rates.
in line with our predictions, we observed significant differences in all aspects of business goals within the group being studied.
over 50% of the businesses surveyed do not aim to expand in terms of size, employees, or customer base in the next year.
additionally, a notable portion of entrepreneurs struggle to envision an ideal business or the timeline for reaching their desired business goals.
this highlights a wide range of aspirations within the business community.
the findings have significant implications for policy and future studies.
understanding the importance of aspirations for business growth can help explain why policies focusing on reducing constraints related to resources and skills often fail to stimulate business expansion.
the diverse results emphasize the need to improve the targeting of programs providing assistance to businesses based on their growth aspirations.
aspirations play a crucial role in predicting future business actions, therefore incorporating them into policies targeting investments, savings, credit utilization, and innovation can enhance their effectiveness.
it is anticipated that such policies will have a greater impact on entrepreneurs with strong aspirations for expanding their businesses.
the guide has been effectively put into practice in albania and guyana, and is currently being implemented in bangladesh, indonesia, malaysia, morocco, and pakistan.
the authorities in guyana have utilized the guidelines to pinpoint key areas for policy actions in the retail payments industry.
by following the outlined calculation process and considering the data indicating that the cost of cash transactions is nearly three times higher than electronic transactions, it is projected that guyana could save up to 1 percent of its gdp by digitizing approximately 75 percent of its existing paper-based consumer and governmental transactions.
albania has utilized the findings in other ongoing projects, such as the creation of the national retail payments strategy.
the point of sale, being the primary channel for cash transactions, presents the greatest opportunity for reducing both the frequency of cash transactions and associated costs.
these outcomes are just a summary of more comprehensive measures and discoveries that will be released in the near future.
the world bank aims to assist other countries in adopting the guide so that national authorities can utilize the outcomes to make necessary policy changes in the retail payment sector.
if there had been a student with more advanced math knowledge in the 10th grade class, the outcome of the self-discovery and discussion lesson could have been altered significantly as they could have shared their expertise with their peers.
however, in a group where everyone has similar levels of knowledge, especially if it is limited, collaboration may not be as productive since conversations might not bring in a variety of new and diverse ideas.
it is essential to grasp how to enhance the continuous professional development initiative in ethiopia.
collaboration is indispensable and should be ongoing, but the substance of the program is equally important.
without access to new information, a group of learners with similar backgrounds cannot reach their maximum potential, even with well-intentioned collaboration efforts and carefully structured 60-hour annual training.
i am confident that my parents prioritized my health above all, but they may have also considered the impact on others when they encouraged me to avoid smoking.
as the eldest of three siblings, my actions likely served as an example for my brothers.
they might have envisioned me starting a family one day and wanted to prevent exposing their future grandchildren to secondhand smoke.
by altering my behavior, they aimed to indirectly benefit others.
in simpler terms, they recognized smoking's negative consequences on those around me and employed a financial incentive to make me acknowledge the costs i could have imposed through smoking.
in a recent research paper, i explore the application of monetary rewards in deterring negative behaviors beyond just smoking.
these behaviors include risky actions like unsafe sex, obesity, alcohol and drug abuse, and premature marriages.
i examine how financial incentives can impact such behaviors, focusing on three mechanisms connected to the reasons for their prevalence: externalities, limited rationality, and resource limitations.
the private sector can contribute in this area.
invest4climate, a collaboration between the world bank and the un, aims to combine public finance, policy changes, and creative financing to attract increased investment from the private sector for climate initiatives.
studies on happiness have consistently highlighted the importance of music in promoting general well-being.
in periods marked by ongoing stress, violence, or instability, having access to music and the arts becomes crucial.
music has the ability to provide solace and healing, offering a means to cope with the wounds caused by challenging life situations like poverty and social injustices.
moreover, music can be utilized to bring attention to societal issues and inspire action towards positive transformations.
na-young, a 12-year-old girl from korea, relocates to north america with her family, leaving her close friend, hae-sung, behind.
despite sharing a strong bond that could potentially grow into something more, their chance to explore this is curtailed by their separate journeys.
during the following 24 years, na-young and hae-sung mature and occasionally interact.
na-young adjusts to a new culture by adopting the name nora, mastering english, and eventually pursuing a career as a playwright.
meanwhile, hae-sung fulfills military duties and establishes himself as an engineer in korea.
their sporadic meetings, both online and in person, complicate their connection, leaving the future of their relationship uncertain.
berkeley public health: how would you explain the concept of artificial intelligence to someone who has been in a coma for 20 years?
jodi halpern states that pattern recognition programs utilize statistical and other models to develop unique simulations that mimic human behavior, decisions, and judgments.
therefore, any system that provides specific types of mental health support should be considered seriously as a potential advantage.
i am worried about the use of marketing bots being presented as therapists and reliable companions for individuals who are feeling depressed or extremely vulnerable.
on the other hand, there is a wide range of applications in the mental health field besides therapy bots.
this includes mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy apps with large user bases that do not focus on simulating relationships.
additionally, some healthcare systems in the uk and certain parts of the us are beginning to utilize ai for medical record management to help alleviate administrative tasks for mental health professionals.
jodi halpern md, phd, holds a position as a professor of bioethics and medical humanities in the ucb-ucsf joint medical program.
jh: the potential of using ai to automate electronic medical records management and other administrative tasks is quite promising.
up to now, digital companies developing mental health apps have not faced consequences for their manipulative actions.
this raises concerns about the need for regulation and safeguarding measures to protect individuals.
while most individuals discuss these issues as distinct concerns, we view them as closely interrelated.
the increasing influence of artificial intelligence and the widespread loneliness crisis together form a potentially harmful combination.
time might be running out before we reach a critical stage of emotional and social damage.
during the early 2000s, psychologist john cacioppo from the university of chicago discussed how loneliness spreads.
he suggested that as people become lonelier, they tend to become more hesitant about engaging socially, worrying about potential rejection or harm.
consequently, they become more cautious and distant from others, avoiding social interactions.
furthermore, ai systems are not created with the intention of facilitating human connections.
in reality, they often hinder such interactions.
it is crucial for companies that create and release ai systems to prioritize this issue to prevent significant harm.
our findings indicate that loneliness can reduce lifespan, while strong social relationships can have life-saving benefits by enhancing well-being, predicting a longer and healthier life, and promoting positive traits in individuals.
it is essential that ai technology is developed in a way that promotes such connections.
the small robotic dinosaur blinks its large blue eyes, extends its neck, and turns its head towards a person who affectionately pats it.
it appears to express happiness as it closes its eyes.
however, when it unexpectedly stops moving, the individual gently flips it over to inspect its battery.
clark and fischer noted that individuals recognize social robots as machines containing wires and sensors designed to appear as characters such as a small dinosaur, a pet dog, or a human caregiver or teacher.
despite this awareness, when engaging with these robots, most people are inclined to interact with them as if they were the characters they represent.
clark noted that individuals also understand that the characters are intentionally created to engage with people.
a viewpoint that builds upon the portrayal model is presented by byron reeves, a stanford researcher and the paul c.
edwards professor of communication in the school of humanities and sciences.
reeves examines how individuals psychologically interpret media characters and avatars, as well as robots.
they claim that interpretations of visual representations are quick and intuitive, and children are able to comprehend them early on.
reeves claimed that his model is better suited for forecasting the future development of social robotics technology.
clark and fischer pointed out that although people may interact with social robots as if they were real humans or animals, the technology is still far off from accurately simulating true human interaction.
this form of excessive optimism also leads to issues with other popular yet restricted technologies like voice assistants and ai chatbots.
according to clark, designers of robots and similar technologies ought to clearly communicate the limitations to users.
clark and fischer's model acknowledges the effort involved in creating social robots and fosters a positive perception of individuals who engage with them.
according to their model, it is considered typical behavior for an individual to treat a small dinosaur robot as if it were a pet.
the key question is whether social media is negatively impacting daily life: is it hindering crucial activities that support mental well-being?
is it leading to noteworthy conflicts or difficulties within relationships with family and friends?
is it impeding progress in schoolwork or academic performance?
in recent years, there has been a significant increase in the use of video chat platforms such as zoom and facetime globally.
these tools, which replicate face-to-face interactions, give users the ability to see their conversation partners.
however, unlike traditional interactions, these platforms also often feature a user's own video feed.
this means that individuals are now continually observing themselves for extended periods of time, as opposed to intermittent glimpses in a mirror.
in addition, being objectified can result in changes in behavior and physiology.
in one study, women who tried on a swimsuit felt feelings of shame, which then led to reduced eating.
other studies have indicated that when women view themselves as objects, they tend to speak less in groups composed of both men and women.
in a study we released in 2021, our research group demonstrated that women who view themselves as objects struggle to accurately perceive their body temperature.
to investigate this phenomenon, we queried women about their perceived coldness when outside nightclubs and bars during chilly evenings.
our findings indicated that the more a woman emphasized her physical appearance, the weaker the relationship between the level of clothing she wore and her perception of cold.
although there is no specific research on the relationship between video meetings and self-objectification, recent studies indicate that our worries may be valid.
a research study revealed that women who prioritize their looks and spend more time on video calls tend to be less satisfied with their appearance.
the feeling of dissatisfaction with one's appearance is tied to zoom fatigue, with women from various ethnic backgrounds reporting higher levels of fatigue compared to men.
extensive research indicates that zoom calls have a strong likelihood to lead to self-objectification, with women bearing the brunt of the negative effects.
the existing gender disparities are worsened in virtual social settings, and taking a break from constantly seeing oneself on screen can significantly benefit mental health, especially for women.
how do people generally react when a meeting is called off?
matt abrahams suggests that most individuals are typically delighted by the news.
if you must schedule a meeting, following these six suggestions from abrahams will ensure that it is effective.
according to abrahams, a successful meeting invitation should capture attendees' interest right from the start and establish a positive atmosphere for effective teamwork, starting with the title of the meeting.
abrahams states that often people schedule meetings based on their own availability without taking into account the state of the attendees, such as their level of rest, hurry, or fatigue.
abrahams suggests that in hybrid meetings with both remote and in-person attendees, soliciting input from the smaller group first can promote greater balance in participation.
unquestioning positivity differs from practical and realistic optimism.
toxic positivity entails the idea that individuals must maintain a positive outlook at all times, regardless of the severity of the situation.
regrettably, attempting to ignore negative feelings is not an effective approach.
avoiding facing difficult emotions is counterproductive and harmful.
toxic positivity involves improperly handling emotions by failing to recognize negative feelings like anger and sadness, which are natural parts of human emotional experience.
creating a culture within organizations that values and recognizes honest expression of emotions, even those that are not always positive, can be beneficial.
while some individuals may receive recognition and motivation for speaking out, others risk being dismissed or penalized.
there are also those who opt to stay silent due to uncertainty about how leadership will react, leading them to suppress their thoughts.
when people opt for silence, they usually do so out of fear or indifference.
the chart illustrates a spectrum ranging from fear to safety and apathy to impact.
the ideal position is the top-right quadrant, indicating a strong balance between safety and impact within an organization, which fosters a healthy environment for speaking up.
this environment is not one of fearlessness but rather a place where individuals are less fearful.
the other two quadrants are more complex.
in the top left quadrant, safety is evident but impact is limited.
in this scenario, you may feel comfortable addressing a situation with a friend, coworker, or manager, but doubt that it would result in significant change.
this hesitation could be due to factors such as bureaucracy, systemic issues, or the perceived unlikeliness of personal behavioral changes.
presently, mclear remains a vocal supporter of assisting leaders and organizations in developing environments in which individuals believe they are important, accepted, and able to be genuine and healthy.
how can we rebuild connections in a time when we are navigating a mix of different work environments, from remote to in-person with masks, and when our comfort in loungewear and the decline in social skills from lack of practice have become challenges we face?
studies indicate that frequent moments of connection are crucial for personal well-being and group productivity.
these interactions can enhance learning abilities, cognitive skills, creativity, focused attention, dedication, and overall performance.
these brief exchanges can leave individuals feeling refreshed and energized, preparing them to address upcoming challenges.
moreover, these small instances of alignment are fundamental in forming strong relationships, as they can enhance your circle of contacts and foster stronger workplace friendships.
the united states has never had a female president, despite the belief of many americans that women are equally qualified for leadership roles as men.
however, gender bias persists, creating obstacles for women seeking to become president.
however, willer points out that it is important to bear in mind that hillary clinton received more votes from the public.
he suggests that if she had been a candidate for governor, she would have emerged victorious.
willer suggests that male democratic candidates should support and promote female candidates by spreading the message about their ability to win elections.
by debunking any misconceptions and working together, there is potential to increase the possibility of a woman being elected as president.
cultivating the quality of intellectual humility is a significant goal, and one way to support this is through the practice of mindfulness, encompassing all its different dimensions.
how can we maintain true and complete mindfulness without falling into the trap of self-assured arrogance, similar to the downfall experienced by the "sage on the hill"?
the ggsc provided funding for this story as part of their initiative to raise awareness of the science of intellectual humility, which is supported by the john templeton foundation.
the practice of mindfulness involves developing the ability to respond thoughtfully rather than reacting impulsively to various situations, thoughts, emotions, or individuals.
this practice is seen as a valuable way to access our potential for intellectual humility by letting go of past experiences and societal influences that weigh us down.
when our guard is up or we are feeling anxious, we tend to stick to our familiar and flawed beliefs about others and the world, which provide us with a sense of safety.
even though we may realize the limitations of these beliefs and understand the benefits of a more humble approach, simply thinking about it is not enough to bring about change.
ultimately, similar to many valuable endeavors, overcoming ingrained habits and behaviors takes time and perseverance.
however, the possibility of creating a more harmonious, optimistic, and joyful society makes it a worthwhile pursuit.
one morning, i reviewed poetry written by my ninth-grade students about experiences with racism.
i was impressed by the eloquence and emotional depth of their work.
however, both my students and i were aware that i would also be assigning grades based on their writing.
engage students in learning activities that meet their needs by incorporating group work, partner discussions, and opportunities for peer connections.
provide positive feedback during early project stages to boost their confidence while also granting them the freedom to make decisions and feel independent.
utilize welcoming language: encourage students to join activities willingly and without pressure whenever feasible.
allow them to make choices and decisions autonomously, and to act based on their own motivation.
demonstrate patience: one of the most difficult things to do is to show students that we are capable of facing challenges and persisting through tough times.
by working on improving our own patience and self-kindness, we strengthen our ability to effectively carry out all our duties as teachers.
the level of independence that students feel during an activity is important.
when students find an activity intrinsically interesting and enjoyable, like writing, drawing, or solving a math problem, they are driven by their desire to improve and master the task.
allowing students to take charge of their learning in this state of intrinsic motivation can lead to them willingly taking on challenges, making it easier for educators to support them as guides rather than strict supervisors.
this could involve students taking the initiative to arrange an activity or find a new way to finish a task, which can serve as a positive example for their peers.
likewise, assigning leadership positions to students can help them learn how to effectively manage key aspects of the classroom, empowering them to assume responsibility and uphold accountability.
perhaps the adolescent who seems unenthusiastic or hesitant is close to experiencing a significant breakthrough in their life.
by regarding students as valuable, skilled, and able, we establish a bond with them and aid in nurturing their self-assurance.
this mutual trust facilitates the development of strong self-esteem, which is based on emotional security, ultimately empowering them to embrace challenges and evolve in the long run.
in the united states, there is a continuous decline in the number of black teachers.
in california, over 78,000 black students attend schools where there are no black teachers.
what is causing black educators to exit the profession?
based on the results of the study and the comments from the survey, the following are five suggestions for school administrators and policymakers trying to encourage black educators to stay.
a culturally affirming school administrator would acknowledge the presence of racism and anti-blackness within their school environment, affecting both students and faculty.
they may analyze student performance data to offer targeted assistance to specific groups based on academic requirements, and work towards ensuring equitable treatment of staff regardless of race or gender.
participants recommended promoting inclusivity by deliberately incorporating elements of black culture into different aspects of the school environment.
for instance, instead of limiting the teaching of historical black figures to black history month, actively incorporate black history lessons throughout the entire academic year.
one illustration of affinity spaces for black students is the black student union framework.
educational institutions that have black student unions facilitate relationships among black students and provide them with chances to investigate colleges and careers that resonate with their identities.
some participants underscored the importance of providing educational opportunities, such as training on implicit bias, anti-black racism, and professional development, for all employees.
they stressed the significance of improving the expertise and capabilities of educators to promote inclusivity in the environment.
simultaneously, along with providing professional development opportunities, it is essential to ensure accountability at the school level.
if teachers are mandated to undergo training in culturally responsive teaching methods, how can we determine its impact on the overall classroom and school environment?
one way to enhance accountability could involve incorporating additional questions in staff satisfaction surveys to evaluate the presence of cultural responsiveness and inclusivity at the school site.
another accountability measure could entail developing a rubric to assess how professional development values are implemented and reflected in the overall school environment and culture.
teachers emphasized the significance of listening to and backing black educators, creating opportunities for them to take on leadership roles, and acknowledging their valuable input.
a number of black educators stated they were not being utilized as leaders within their schools or were frequently passed over for roles such as instructional coaching or leading their department.
this overlooking of black educators is seen as a display of bias and it is recommended that schools and districts actively work towards empowering black educators to take on leadership responsibilities.
for instance, schools can establish mentorship or training programs for black teachers to explore and take on responsibilities beyond their classroom duties.
this approach provides teachers with a platform to understand various positions within their school or school district.
individuals who reported being the sole black educators in their school expressed feeling pressured to represent the entire black community.
this leads to a negative school atmosphere where microaggressions are prevalent among both students and staff.
to address this issue, school districts can actively seek to hire black educators by collaborating with teaching programs that have diverse participants or providing support for black educators as they start their careers.
after becoming a mother, i entered a new phase of growth where i had to let go of old beliefs.
instead of focusing on individualism and expecting certain outcomes, i now had to confront my own arrogance and the tendency to always be the one assisting others, rather than allowing myself to be helped.
however, despite the compelling research, it became apparent that only my daughter, among the group sitting on the couch, would attend the nearby school with a predominantly black student population.
a collection of essays written by individuals seeking to integrate the principles of leading a purposeful life into their everyday experiences.
i soon realized that by actively listening and being open to surprising answers, i could be sure that my actions were driven by solidarity, not a savior complex.
chronic absenteeism is prevalent in public schools after the pandemic, including ours.
when the community school manager was asked about potential solutions to help marginalized students attend more regularly, it was anticipated that practical items like bus passes or alarm clocks would be suggested.
however, the surprising recommendation was a costly hair product that older girls at the school consider essential.
the manager believed that providing this product to the students, particularly unhoused girls, would encourage more regular attendance.
as a result, the product was purchased and distributed by the community school manager.
during this time of personal growth within the school community, my journey took a turn into the personal and political realms.
i was introduced to the enneagram, a personality classification system with origins in ancient traditions, now brought into mainstream awareness by oscar ichazo, a south american individual.
the enneagram consists of nine distinct personality types, each characterized by unique motivations and challenges.
arndt and jonsson displayed moral courage by rescuing miller and preventing her attacker from causing further harm.
moral courage is required in situations where we witness our values being compromised, societal expectations being disregarded, or laws being violated.
by taking action to prevent these injustices, even in the face of potential negative consequences, we demonstrate moral courage.
in different contexts, individuals demonstrate moral courage by facing bullies, challenging discriminatory actions, or exposing cheating.
this bravery can also be shown in the workplace through actions like exposing corporate fraud.
despite potential consequences like physical harm or social rejection, those who bravely defend their ethics can serve as protectors, drivers of social progress, and sources of inspiration for others, ultimately making a significant positive impact.
given this situation, the aspiration is for a society where a large number of individuals exhibit moral courage.
unfortunately, the occurrence of moral courage is quite scarce.
instances of violent altercations, sexual misconduct, or racist incidents often go unaddressed, with bystanders choosing not to intervene.
many of us may have witnessed or experienced such situations and opted to stay on the sidelines.
witnesses must observe an event and then perceive it as an act of misconduct.
afterwards, witnesses must take on accountability and have confidence in their ability to intervene effectively.
in the end, observers must determine whether to take action despite possible dangers.
in a recent research project, researchers studied moral courage using an experience-sampling method.
participants were asked to report instances of wrongdoing they witnessed in their daily lives over a week through their mobile phones.
upon reporting a wrongdoing, participants answered questions related to various aspects of the moral courage model.
the results supported the model, indicating that moral courage was more prevalent when participants felt accountable and competent, but decreased when they viewed the situation as being potentially risky.
in summary, it is important to recognize that moral courage is a multifaceted process that is influenced, in part, by both our individual characteristics and the circumstances we find ourselves in.
when faced with a situation that demands moral courage, it can be difficult to recognize the positive impacts it can have for the broader community, as certain acts of moral courage may not always feel comfortable.
think about the concept of moral courage in relation to bullying situations.
it can be challenging to speak up against classmates or inform a teacher about the issue, especially when we feel a strong bond of loyalty with them.
this loyalty to our peers may clash with our desire to advocate for what is right, hindering us from taking action.
in combination, demonstrating moral courage is frequently difficult.
however, understanding these challenges should not dishearten us.
instead, we can utilize this understanding to create specific strategies for fostering moral courage.
each individual has the opportunity to cultivate greater moral courage, but it doesn't have to be a task undertaken alone.
various institutions like educational institutions, workplaces, and online platforms also have a vital part to play in this endeavor.
what specific suggestions can be offered to promote moral courage in these settings?
develop and reinforce social and ethical standards: by having a clear grasp of our ethical principles, it is simpler to identify unethical behaviors.
organizations can aid in this effort by recognizing and exemplifying core values.
for instance, the moral standards and principles exemplified by educators can serve as significant guiding principles for children and adolescents.
in situations where wrongdoing occurs, it is important not to suppress anger as it can drive action and intervention.
it is also crucial to understand that when individuals express anger, it should not be dismissed as unreasonable but viewed as a reaction to injustice.
offer and promote reporting mechanisms: institutions can offer reporting systems to help witnesses report incidents more easily and without the need for direct confrontation, lessening the burden on individuals to choose the best intervention method.
displaying social support: if individuals confront a perpetrator, it is important for others to be encouraged to assist them in order to minimize potential dangers.
practicing self-compassion involves treating oneself with the same kindness one would show a friend during difficult times.
by soothing ourselves when facing challenges and encouraging ourselves with kindness, we can reduce anxiety and depression.
adolescents who cultivate self-compassion tend to experience lower levels of anxiety and depression.
this practice also helps children effectively deal with obstacles, leading to increased well-being and self-esteem.
how can we support children in cultivating a compassionate inner voice?
here are three strategies to achieve this goal.
the manner in which we communicate with children significantly influences their internal dialogue.
consistent validation and nurturing from caregivers can lead to the development of an inner voice that is compassionate.
studies indicate that children who receive supportive and empathetic parenting are more likely to treat themselves with kindness.
conversely, children of parents who are critical tend to be more self-critical.
initially, it may be uncomfortable to show ourselves kindness.
feeling uneasy when trying something new is typical, but this discomfort diminishes as we become more accustomed to it.
just like mastering riding a bike or solving math problems requires practice, nurturing a self-compassionate mindset also requires practice.
roderick's extensive experience advocating for racial equity and social responsibility has shaped a framework for fostering change.
the book outlines eight dimensions essential for establishing and upholding environments that promote students' grasp of civil resistance, critical thinking for solving urgent issues, and the significance of empathy among peers.
it serves as both a motivating call to action and a practical guide offering suitable teaching methods, best practices, and educational resources for schools and classrooms.
a common belief in society is that as we age, our ability to imagine decreases.
however, in the book learning to imagine, cognitive scientist andrew shtulman challenges this notion.
he posits that our imagination actually improves as we accumulate knowledge and experiences throughout our lives.
therefore, contrary to popular belief, our capacity for imagination does not decline over time; rather, it continues to expand as we learn and reflect.
in contrast to the standard method that focuses solely on overall life satisfaction, the culturally sensitive approach yields higher average happiness ratings in countries that prioritize interdependence, harmony, and relationships.
this suggests that traditional happiness assessments may underestimate the well-being of collectivist societies.
this work emphasizes the significance of cultural influences on gauging happiness, suggesting that other cultural beliefs and perspectives are also influential in shaping individuals' perception of happiness.
there are various methods of measuring happiness that could serve as valuable avenues for further research.
did such measures contribute to enhancing the quality of the research?
a study by university of british columbia professor elizabeth dunn and graduate student dunigan folk, published in nature human behaviour, examined 532 studies on five key practices for a happier life: gratitude, social interaction, exercise, mindfulness, and spending time in nature.
a study conducted on more than 500 middle school students over two school years revealed that classrooms that focus on effort, growth, and acceptance of mistakes promote the development of intellectual humility.
another study involving high school students, young adults, and undergraduates found that classrooms emphasizing intellectual ability tend to hinder the development of intellectual humility.
a recent study published in the journal of positive psychology this year recommends one specific strategy: engaging in random acts of kindness.
one possible reason for this is that assisting others reduces our tendency to focus on ourselves in social interactions, according to researcher jennifer cheavens.
this can lead to an increase in happiness and self-confidence.
additionally, acts of kindness have the power to strengthen social connections.
another study conducted in 2023 discovered that teenagers who participated in a kindness game on an app showed greater levels of compassion and empathy towards others and were less likely to engage in physical aggression compared to those who played a different game.
the research revealed that individuals who frequently ghosted their friends exhibited higher levels of depression later on, independent of their initial level of depression.
according to michaela forrai, the findings imply that ghosting can have a negative impact on our mental well-being, possibly due to its detrimental effects on significant relationships.
however, many of us may also be feeling compassion fatigue as we become less empathetic due to exposure to hardship and suffering.
is there a way to address this issue?
a study published in psychological science in 2023 by researchers izzy gainsburg and julia lee cunningham from the university of michigan suggests that viewing compassion in a new light could potentially help reduce feelings of fatigue.
one initial approach suggested in a recent study is to prioritize the development of a supportive work environment.
after one year, individuals who received increased support in the workplace were found to display higher levels of productivity, engagement, focus, and overall well-being.
parents are frequently seeking new advice on how to support their children's development, but research suggests that caring for ourselves is fundamental for our children to thrive.
in a recent emotion journal article, katherine nelson-coffey and john coffey identified a straightforward method to achieve this: expressing gratitude through practice.
one possibility is that we tend to pay more attention to negative aspects of life and overlook the improvements that have occurred over time, leading to a false perception of moral decline, as suggested by mastroianni.
research indicates that violent crimes are on the decline, people are probably less self-centered nowadays, and commonly held beliefs about different generations are mostly inaccurate.
in our experiences as parents, we all face moments of stress, confusion, joy, and contentment.
however, each parenting journey is distinct and may involve unique challenges.
some parents care for children with chronic health issues, demanding extra caregiving abilities.
others navigate the pressures of parenting adolescents in a competitive society.
meanwhile, some parents have adult children, presenting new phases and obstacles to overcome.
in 2023, the top parenting books offer valuable advice based on scientific research to help parents cultivate love, connection, and resilience in their children.
these books address various subjects, such as the link between parenting and nature, breaking the cycle of adverse childhood experiences, and the importance of parental well-being for overall child well-being.
this captivating and insightful book explores the brilliance of the natural world in a manner that will inspire wonder, while also shedding light on the discrepancies in the upbringing of children in western societies shaped by colonization, prompting readers to reflect deeply.
narvaez and bradshaw outline the challenges of stress and loneliness faced by many children in the modern world and emphasize the pressing need for intervention.
crucially, the book offers advice to parents on the importance of actively listening to their preadolescents and adolescents instead of solely engaging in monologues.
the authors emphasize the significance of listening, as it fosters a sense of validation and respect among children and enhances parental understanding of their experiences and perspectives.
this understanding enables parents to offer more effective support and guidance in their interactions with their children.
conversely, he suggests that striving for perfection can be counterproductive.
being a perfectionist can be harmful, as it can hinder our ability to perform at our best by causing us to avoid discomfort and errors, which are vital for personal development and improvement.
we requested participants to provide genuine feedback on the practices shown on ggia by conducting semi-structured interviews.
these interviews covered a range of topics like childhood emotional experiences, encounters with racism, perspectives on emotions, methods of expressing emotions, influences in learning about emotions, and so on.
the aim was to delve deeply into the lives of the participants through meaningful and genuine discussions.
all members of our focus group raised various issues regarding the concepts, terminology, and objectives of the 15 happiness practices.
however, they all provided a detailed set of suggestions on how to enhance these practices to better address the needs of the black community.
the following suggestions, derived from these discussions, have the potential to assist educators, mental health professionals, and psychologists to modify happiness techniques in a manner that resonates with black individuals.

a picture taken during the time of slavery at boone hall plantation in south carolina.
the initial challenge in considering black happiness is rooted in the extensive history of slavery, segregation, and racial discrimination faced by african americans.
these systemic barriers have impeded their ability to attain basic well-being and have posed additional obstacles to finding happiness.
the use of racial stereotypes raises doubts about the validity of discussions on african american happiness, highlighting how black joy has historically been used to justify oppressive practices like slavery and white supremacy.
in essence, addressing happiness and other positive emotions within the context of an oppressed community is complex and fraught with challenges.
certainly, black perspectives on happiness also emphasize that the african american experience of joy is frequently dampened by the realization that displaying black happiness could perpetuate negative stereotypes and prejudices about the black community.
during the 1930s, he became well-known for his roles providing humor in many hollywood films.
he typically portrayed a submissive, dim-witted, humorously idle, clumsy african american character, which was characterized by his wide, cheerful grin.
race relations in the south of america were more hierarchical and violent compared to other regions.
however, even in the northern and western parts of the country, black individuals also faced pressures to demonstrate deference towards white people.
hollywood films prior to the 1950s predominantly portrayed black men and women as submissive figures like stepin fetchit and smiling caregivers, enforcing these stereotypes among the public.
beckham was surprised by the results he obtained.
his participants were happier than he had anticipated, and their responses contradicted the negative expectations based on questioning whether black individuals as a whole were content or should be satisfied.
in addition, the black workers he examined seemed to be more content compared to the black professionals and students he studied, despite facing challenges in their social and economic circumstances.
it is possible that these challenges contributed to their overall happiness.
the history of black joy highlights that inequality is not only a societal issue but also impacts mental well-being.
affluent individuals with higher wealth and income are often protected from the challenges and uncertainties faced by those with lower incomes.
in relational cultural theory, it is proposed that suffering arises from a lack of connection, while belonging is seen as the antidote to suffering.
the perpetuation of animosity and the presence of adversaries only worsen feelings of isolation.
conversely, love and its accompanying qualities such as empathy, comprehension, security, admiration, and an acknowledgment of our shared human experience, foster a sense of belonging that counteracts suffering.
being mindful of your thoughts and feelings provides a solid basis for engaging with negative thoughts.
by grounding yourself in the present moment and focusing on your physical sensations, you can better manage difficult emotions without immediately resorting to negative narratives, self-criticism, or forming barriers to love, compassion, and overall well-being.
one could envision a kind or spiritual entity using these words for you, and directing these words toward a random person can also have a positive impact on our well-being.
this process aids in ridding ourselves of negative emotions such as hatred.
when applied, it helps in developing a strong self-perception to manage difficult experiences and challenges.
enemies, animosity, and pain should be viewed with a balanced perspective.
it is natural for humans to oscillate between love and hate, preferences and aversions, and feelings of fear and insecurity.
these emotions are a common part of our psychological makeup.
when feeling vulnerable, enemies may seem plentiful.
however, our brains are wired for survival rather than joy, so they have a tendency to fixate on negative experiences and threats, amplifying their significance.
however, excessive control and lack of control can both lead to issues.
this typically occurs when various biological, social, and individual influences result in decreased adaptability.
individuals who are highly overcontrolled may find it challenging to deal with change, as they are often less receptive to new experiences and feedback, and tend to be firmly set in their routines.
they may harbor feelings of jealousy towards others and have difficulty letting loose and enjoying themselves in social settings.
additionally, they may show minimal expressions, seldom displaying emotions openly or responding with smiles or tears, while making efforts to conceal their feelings.
these qualities can increase the chances of a person feeling socially isolated and lonely, leading to a decline in their mental well-being.
however, in order for someone to receive appropriate assistance, they need to be accurately recognized as having high levels of overcontrol.
the current evaluation process for overcontrol can be time-consuming and intricate, requiring completion of several questionnaires and an interview with a trained clinician.
this may restrict individuals' access to assistance and impede research progress.
i am currently creating a more straightforward assessment approach to quickly detect issues with overcontrol.
this will facilitate further research on overcontrol for researchers.
berkeley public health: how would you explain artificial intelligence to a person who has just woken up after a 20-year coma?
jodi halpern explains that the technology utilizes statistical and other models to develop advanced pattern recognition algorithms capable of replicating human behavior, decision-making, and judgments.
artificial intelligence reasoning methods differ from those used by humans, but large language models demonstrate the ability to mimic human behavior.
therefore, any system that provides specific types of mental health support should be considered seriously as a possible advantage.
i am worried about the use of marketing bots as therapists and trusted companions for individuals who are depressed or extremely vulnerable.
however, there are various applications in the field of mental health that go beyond therapy bots, such as mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy apps that have garnered a large user base.
additionally, certain healthcare systems in the uk and the us are beginning to implement ai technology for medical record-keeping purposes to alleviate administrative tasks for mental health professionals.
jodi halpern, md, phd, is a professor of bioethics and medical humanities at the ucb-ucsf joint medical program.
jh: the use of ai to handle electronic medical records and other administrative duties shows great potential.
there is a significant burnout issue in the field of medicine overall, with a large percentage of physicians and nurses reporting feeling burnt out.
this is concerning as it results in healthcare providers being unable to offer the level of compassionate and focused care that patients require.
up to now, digital companies developing different mental health apps have not faced consequences for potentially manipulative actions.
this raises concerns about ensuring regulation and safeguarding individuals from harm.
belize, tajikistan, and azerbaijan have recently achieved malaria-free status, with countries like rwanda and ghana also showing significant progress in the fight against malaria.
the gene-editing technology crispr, whose creators received the nobel prize in 2020, has transitioned from the laboratory to practical applications.
recently, the united kingdom, bahrain, and the united states have authorized the first therapeutic use of crispr.
in the springtime, the food and drug administration gave its approval to the first vaccine for rsv, a respiratory virus that poses risks to both children and older individuals.
for the first time ever, artificial intelligence has played a role in the discovery of a new antibiotic and a novel class of antibiotics.
in july, ghana joined the ranks of 123 other countries worldwide and 28 other african countries in abolishing the death penalty, with the exception of cases involving high treason.
despite 2023 being the hottest year recorded and global emissions staying persistently high, there were several positive developments for the climate.
although there is limited evidence of the benefits of social prescribing in children, research in adults has shown that it can enhance quality of life and alleviate social isolation.
as more children are in need of mental health services but face long waiting periods, social prescribing could be a potential solution to offer support during this wait for assessment.
this approach may provide different methods to enhance mental health and overall well-being.
however, due to limited proof of its effectiveness, further investigation is imperative before implementing any programs.
research on young working-class men in south wales reveals shifting perspectives on masculinity.
while some men reject the concept of toxic masculinity, viewing it as a way to shame men, others struggle to align changing ideals of manhood with outdated, harmful behaviors.
the complexity is exacerbated by the ambiguous nature of the term.
toxic masculinity is essentially an extreme emphasis or exaggerated display of traits typically associated with masculinity, like competition, self-reliance, and emotional suppression.
this often results in behavior such as taking risks, avoiding vulnerability, and difficulty in expressing emotions, which can have harmful effects on both men and women.
for instance, some men may avoid talking about mental health due to a rejection of weakness and vulnerability, while others who struggle to express their emotions may show it through frustration, anger, and physical violence.
however, qualities typically associated with masculinity, like being strong and unemotional, can also have their value in certain situations, such as during emergencies and when important life-or-death decisions need to be made.
this shows that masculinity is multifaceted and can manifest in various forms.
society has traditionally valued masculinity that includes attributes like bravery, resilience, and physical power.
for instance, historically, labor-intensive jobs in industries like manufacturing along with traditional family dynamics have contributed to the development of gender stereotypes where men are typically seen as the primary providers and women as homemakers.
this has further emphasized characteristics like resilience and emotional detachment as defining features of masculinity.
given this context, it is imperative to promptly reevaluate the insights provided by current research regarding men and masculinity.
the evolving society and economy are influencing changes in men's behavior, as indicated by research findings.
for instance, studies on white, middle-class men in university show an increased tendency to openly communicate and express their emotions both verbally and physically.
critics of this notion argue that young men in such positions may defy traditional concepts of masculinity due to their elevated social standing.
recent qualitative research indicates that there is a shift in the behavior of certain working-class young men.
they are becoming more inclined to express their emotions openly, acknowledge vulnerability, and hold more equal views on household chores.
although exhibiting such progressive attitudes, they occasionally resort to using sexist and homophobic language.
my research supports the notion that there are positive societal shifts occurring in the construct of masculinity.
conversely, he contends that striving for perfection is also not advisable.
perfectionism can hinder us in negative ways, impeding our ability to perform at our best due to our fear of discomfort and failure, which are essential components for personal development and progress.
in my own study with peers, we discovered that when analyzing children's performance in cognitive assessments, only children display similarities to children raised with one sibling.
we demonstrated that the differences we noticed between generations can be traced back in part to the evolving features of families with only one child.
our research in britain revealed that single-child households generally have higher socioeconomic status.
however, we observed a shift over time where being an only child has increasingly been linked to potentially challenging circumstances like being raised in a family with divorced parents.
the evolving structure of families with only one child can account for why the advantage experienced by isolated children today is not as significant as it was in the past when compared to those raised with siblings.
collectively, the findings indicate that whether individuals have siblings or not does not have a significant influence, especially when compared to other aspects of family life.
for instance, our study found that coming from a underprivileged upbringing seems to have a greater influence on children's cognitive test performance than whether they have siblings or not.
the findings also indicate that it is necessary to move away from viewing only children as a homogenous group with common characteristics.
the idea of being an only child is not unchanging and varies based on societal changes and the different types of families that have only one child.
reevaluating how we perceive and research only children will enhance our comprehension and challenge the enduring stereotypes present in society.
the climate crisis is pervasive in our world today.
it can feel overwhelming when billionaires like jeff bezos and elon musk are spending exorbitant amounts on private space trips while also contributing large quantities of greenhouse gases.
amidst this, small individual actions like using metal straws instead of plastic or choosing to walk instead of drive may appear insignificant, as well as the impact of individual votes.
this narrative depicts the transmission of hope from a small demonstration to government leaders, illustrating the potential impact of individuals in addressing climate change.
it suggests that a key strategy in confronting this challenge is choosing to actively participate in this network of hope.
every autumn, numerous high school seniors start the challenging process of sending in their college applications.
however, the process leading up to this difficult transitional period actually begins long before.
during their formative years, children and their families internalize societal expectations emphasizing the importance of academic success and future professional accomplishments in a competitive environment.
consequently, many individuals come to assess their value based on their academic achievements and extracurricular accolades.
maryam abdullah inquires about the evidence indicating that a focus on achievement can be harmful.
parents are reacting to long-standing structural issues by adjusting to significant economic shifts, such as rising inequality, the decline of the middle class, globalization, and intense competition.
they worry that without their active supervision and encouragement, their children may struggle economically.
in the face of growing inequality, childhood is no longer viewed as a distinct phase but rather as a critical period for equipping children for a challenging and uncertain future.
how could our objectives and daily choices be influenced if we reevaluated our perspective on well-being?
what advantages might be experienced in both our personal lives and communities?
consider the following innovative concepts regarding happiness and well-being that may prompt reflection and change in your own life.
if you are intrigued by the idea of a fulfilling life following this path, consider incorporating more spontaneity and fun into your daily routine.
explore new activities and remain open to the possibilities they may bring.
while happiness and fulfillment may vary with life's challenges, psychological depth can be cultivated gradually through continuous new experiences.
a team of researchers is looking into a lesser-explored aspect of happiness in well-being studies, focusing on tranquil sensations of serenity, equilibrium, and unity.
for instance, what causes variations in economic success among individuals?
some may attribute it to personal dedication, while others may emphasize the influence of external factors like education, family background, ethnicity, or geographical location.
it is important for individuals to feel a level of control over their own lives.
research has shown that having this sense of control can lead to better health and lower levels of apathy and hopelessness.
those who do not recognize or value the impact of external factors may tend to be excessively critical of themselves when they fail or show little empathy towards those facing greater challenges than themselves.
what are the factors that contribute to the success or failure of students in education?
is it due to varying levels of effort among students, or is it influenced by the amount of support and resources provided by schools and teachers?
what factors contribute to climate change?
is it possible for individuals to play a role in reducing its impact?
why have minority groups been historically oppressed?
is it due to persistent systemic racism or actions of individuals in the past?
thankfully, there are numerous actions we can take to cultivate a more positive sense of acknowledgment in both our personal lives and communities.
our non-profit organization, moving up media lab, has developed several resources that help individuals evaluate their attribution more effectively.
additional individuals were instructed to engage in a poverty simulation game named spent for 10 minutes to showcase the different external factors that lead to poverty.
however, even in these narratives, we can observe significant external influences at work.
for instance, consider the film rocky.
while it is evident that rocky puts in immense effort to attain success in boxing, a closer examination of the original film reveals numerous external elements that, had they been different, could have hindered his success.
for instance, his opportunity to compete for the championship only arises when another boxer sustains an injury.
he is chosen from a list of local fighters primarily due to his italian surname.
initially, he declines the chance to fight for the title until persuaded by the boxing promoter.
his loan shark employer grants him time off and funds for training.
paulie supplies him with complimentary steaks daily.
adrian steadfastly backs him, and the list continues.
by sharing more detailed stories about giving credit, we can enhance a culture that has a more balanced and healthier understanding of the factors that truly influence life results.
one example that i find especially interesting is the research done by rachel l.
ruttan, who is an assistant professor of organizational behavior at the university of toronto.
her research revealed that individuals who had faced and successfully overcome personal challenges tended to show less empathy towards others currently facing the same challenges, compared to individuals who had not experienced those struggles.
for instance, individuals who have successfully quit smoking or lost their job may be less compassionate toward others going through the same struggles, compared to those who never smoked or were never fired.
this contradicts our usual expectations of empathy.
ruttan suggests that this behavior might be linked to how people attribute success.
when individuals believe their accomplishments are circumstantial, they may feel less confident in their success.
conversely, those who see their achievements as a result of their own efforts tend to feel more secure in their accomplishments but may also be more inclined to view others' struggles as a lack of determination.
having a deeper understanding of attribution can be a catalyst for transformation both personally and on a societal level.
it encourages us to ponder essential questions in a non-confrontational manner, without the usual criticism associated with discussions about privilege.
it offers a more sophisticated and comprehensive approach than relying solely on sheer determination.
this insight can enhance the narratives we create about ourselves and those around us.
just think about the possibility of more individuals sharing such experiences.
how much greater could our generosity be?
how much more accountable would we become?
how much more compassionate could we be towards ourselves and others, leading to less criticism and judgment?
during times of intense stress, such as when someone is approaching death, experiencing awe may still have a positive impact.
maria monroy, dacher keltner, and their team conducted a research study amidst the covid pandemic to investigate this phenomenon.
collaborating with a community population and healthcare workers, their findings reveal the significance of feeling part of something greater than oneself in deriving meaning, particularly during periods of hardship.
when considering remarkable experiences, many people might immediately think of iconic landmarks like the eiffel tower or the grand canyon.
however, awe can be found in even the most ordinary moments.
so, what defines awe and how do such experiences benefit us?
reduced self-centeredness: awe has the potential to counter self-absorption by offering us a broader perspective.
numerous studies indicate that experiencing awe can promote acts of kindness and empathy.
a stronger perception of significance and direction: awe appears to fuel both feelings of spirituality and an interest in scientific exploration.
the participants in the research began with a one-hour zoom session for education and orientation.
following that, they were given a series of online questionnaires every day for 22 days.
the questions covered topics ranging from feelings of awe and other positive emotions to bodily discomforts like fatigue and pain.
the surveys also inquired about stress levels and overall feelings of well-being.
it was observed that days with more experiences of awe resulted in lower stress levels and a heightened feeling of well-being among both the community participants and healthcare workers.
community members reported fewer physical ailments like back pain and headaches on days with more awe.
however, these benefits were not observed among the healthcare workers.
a document written for the john templeton foundation by the greater good science center at uc berkeley.
the study's limitations are influenced by its timing, as it was conducted during the pandemic, leading to a reliance on a convenience sample of willing participants.
this suggests that the findings may not be broadly representative of the general population.
nevertheless, the results provide a basis for further research in different contexts or with specific groups facing difficult situations.
according to the main author of the study, jasper van assche from a university in belgium, this indicates that contact theory remains effective even in situations of conflict.
van assche desires that his study will encourage individuals to recognize the advantages of combining living spaces and enhancing chances for positive interactions among different groups.
this could be achieved through both top-down approaches, like government-mandated school integration, as well as grassroots efforts.
for instance, van assche proposes that communities could organize inexpensive and casual gatherings to facilitate connections among people, thereby diminishing biases and fostering acceptance in an informal manner.
in a recent study published in the journal nature, researchers examined various surveys from a large number of americans and individuals from 59 other countries across the globe.
the participants in these surveys had expressed their opinions regarding the trends of honesty, ethical conduct, and moral principles in their respective societies.
in a recent publication in the journal of child psychology and psychiatry, kim and his team discovered that children born to younger mothers and those living in highly stressful households were more likely to experience mental health issues if they had been exposed to discrimination and violence before birth during the apartheid era in south africa.
kim went to emory university for his bachelor's degree and then pursued further studies at northwestern university, focusing on biological anthropology and researching how societal oppression affects health.
they aimed to investigate how stress hormones and the immune system could perpetuate trauma across generations.
they were curious about how the stress experienced during the apartheid era could impact children years later and potentially lead to mental health issues.
furthermore, they pondered on the potential benefits of reparations and restorative justice in addressing and healing the damage caused by past traumas.
he mentioned that by having this information, students and researchers could enhance the availability of mental health services in the area for individuals, including those affected by intergenerational trauma.
kim mentioned that a project planned to be completed in nine months, which commenced in september 2019, ended up taking two and a half years because of research delays and travel restrictions caused by the pandemic.
we have collected articles that delve into the origins of peace, conflict, and healing; provide tools for personal well-being and advocacy; and highlight the inherent kindness in humanity.
a study discovered that higher exposure to prenatal stress during apartheid did not lead to a higher occurrence of mental illness in the child.
this finding goes against previous research on prenatal stress and intergenerational trauma, which has typically shown a clear connection between stress during pregnancy and mental health problems.
kim discovered that expectant mothers who face specific stressors might be introducing their unborn babies to negative psychological responses to stress.
this can potentially raise the likelihood of psychiatric disorders for the child.
kim was surprised by the discovery.
considering the turbulent and violent circumstances during apartheid, as well as previous studies on intergenerational trauma, he believed it made sense that there would be a noticeable impact on the mother-child relationships.
in october 1936, a group of 200 individuals embarked on a journey from south tyneside to london to raise awareness about the economic hardships and joblessness affecting their community of jarrow.
in this pilot project, participants are compensated at a rate equivalent to a separate program by the welsh government, which supports individuals transitioning out of care.
the jarrow and east finchley pilot specifically targets a more diverse group of individuals within these communities.
the project has been built on our studies of universal basic income, indicating that addressing financial instability is crucial for improving public health.
this is especially pertinent at present due to the impact of covid-19 and the rising cost of living on employed individuals, self-employed individuals, and small business owners, placing many at risk of extreme poverty.
this has led to a secondary crisis of mental health issues that is expected to escalate.
our latest report demonstrates that the only solution to resolving this ongoing crisis is through taking decisive and impactful actions.
the concept of the government distributing resources through consistent and reliable payments to all citizens is innovative and transformative.
it shifts the focus of welfare from aiding only a specific group who lack other means of meeting their needs to supporting both employed and unemployed individuals in avoiding poverty.
one important yet often ignored outcome of basic income is its possible positive impact on public health.
if set at an appropriate amount, basic income could enhance public health in three different ways.
furthermore, by lessening economic disparities, individuals would have the choice to exit harmful situations, thereby decreasing both stress and stress-induced health issues.
the pandemic has underscored the risks of individuals being trapped in such environments, with potentially substantial health consequences in the long term.
furthermore, by providing individuals with a more stable and foreseeable future, their perception of their longevity may also improve.
this enhanced perception could influence their behavior, leading to potential changes.
for instance, individuals with a clear outlook on their future may be less inclined to participate in risky behaviors like substance abuse, and more inclined to prioritize activities that benefit their health and well-being, based on our findings.
the nhs introduced free healthcare services.
thirty years later, the labour government aimed to investigate the reasons behind the continued existence of health disparities.
in the future, people might wonder why there was resistance to universal basic incomes (ubis) in the same way we now question the opposition to the national health service (nhs) in the 1940s.
however, following world war ii, a unique phenomenon occurred in california as sexual minorities began relocating to the san francisco bay area and establishing some of the earliest openly gay, lesbian, and transgender communities.
concurrently, for heterosexuals, the advent of new contraception methods allowed for a separation of sexual pleasure from procreation, women attained increased economic independence, and divorce rates surged.
various countercultures in california, such as the beats and hippies, overtly rejected traditional ideals of sexual monogamy.
this trend saw a proliferation of cults and organizations championing personal development and sexual liberation.
second-wave feminism intersected with these movements, challenging the underlying male dominance and steering them towards a more egalitarian framework.
understanding this history is crucial as it shows that polyamory has never been primarily focused on youth, beauty, and sexual relationships.
people have always aged while being involved in multiple partnerships; society just struggles to acknowledge older individuals and accept non-monogamous relationship structures.
one thing that stood out to me is that when everyone involved consciously adopts the principles of polyamory, it can contribute to greater happiness in later stages of life.
embracing this mindset involves seeking innovative solutions that polyamory allows for, and acknowledging the advantages of letting go of traditional expectations of monogamy.
according to child development research, it is important for children, especially young ones, to have direct and straightforward visual representations.
children are more responsive to clear and simple messages and stories rather than subtle cues.
visual learning is a primary mode of learning for kids, and they benefit greatly from seeing characters that resemble themselves on screen.
contrary to the belief that children are not influenced by appearance, they do pay attention to characters who look and behave like them, which can significantly impact their self-esteem.
to foster diversity representation, it is essential for children to see human characters that mirror their own identities, rather than animals, monsters, or robots.
working together, we can support children in embracing their experiences and identities, educate them about diverse perspectives, and empower future generations to be more confident and skillful in understanding and addressing issues related to race.
christine clark specializes in studying the reasons behind why individuals cause harm to others, in order to help identify ways to address and prevent violence.
the issue of police brutality has gained significant attention as more incidents are being recorded, yet the problem persists.
clark questions why this is the case despite the increased visibility of these events.
what are some potential remedies to address police brutality in your opinion?
your work also explores the growing issue of mass shootings in the country, as the frequency of these incidents continues to rise each year.
for instance, there were over 50 mass shootings in january 2023 alone.
do these shootings serve as inspiration for others to commit similar acts?
cc: did your research discover any possible methods to mitigate the ideological connections that you believe can result in individuals engaging in violent acts?
happiness scores are derived from a survey that assesses life satisfaction by asking respondents to envision a ladder representing their life, with 0 being the worst possible life and 10 being the best.
participants are then asked to rank themselves on this ladder, encouraging reflection on their own well-being, achievements, resources, and social status.
in the research, a culturally appropriate method was created to assess well-being, revealing that the current happiness rankings may not fully capture the scores in some nations.
this study identified a potentially more precise approach to gauge happiness globally.
our views on happiness are influenced by our cultural background.
for instance, in cultures that prioritize individualism, happiness is often measured by personal satisfaction and self-experience.
in such cultures, happiness is often associated with feelings of excitement and enjoyment.
in some countries, the emphasis on happiness is rooted in connections and maintaining positive relationships, prioritizing social harmony and reliance on others.
unlike individualistic cultures, where happiness is seen as an individual pursuit, in collectivist cultures, people attribute their happiness to communal experiences and the well-being of those around them.
consequently, individuals in these cultures tend to perceive happiness as contentment, and their own happiness levels are often influenced by the happiness of those in their social circle.
surprisingly, despite being commonly perceived as unattractive and unpleasant creatures, rats exhibit compassion in experiments by helping a distressed fellow rat, even at the cost of having to share a cherished piece of chocolate.
this behavior is not always evident in all humans.
elephants display high levels of empathy, as seen in their willingness to help injured individuals and their grieving behavior when one of their own dies.
an example of this is the case of the elderly matriarch eleanor, who was repeatedly supported by another matriarch named grace during her struggles.
the elephants' emotional reactions are evident in instances where they seem distraught or disconsolate, such as when encountering the body of a companion of a different species, as demonstrated by a young elephant reacting to the remains of a rhinoceros killed by poachers.
stanford medicine researchers, along with colleagues from two other institutions, have published a study that challenges established beliefs about the biological basis of friendliness, romantic attachment, and parental behavior.
oxytocin has long been associated with promoting bonding and nurturing behavior in mammals.
it has been increasingly tested in clinical trials as a drug to potentially improve social behavior in individuals with conditions like schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder.
oxytocin works by attaching to its specific receptor, which is a protein found on the surface of cells in various areas of the brain.
is it possible that this respected hormone is betraying its known receptor by engaging in secret interactions with a yet-to-be-discovered receptor that is right in front of us?
numerous individuals seek to find purpose and fulfillment in life.
however, what distinguishes a meaningful life from simply a happy one is a common question.
some individuals found meaning in their own work and personal lives, rather than just focusing on helping others.
they derived equal satisfaction and purpose from activities that were self-beneficial.
when the researchers delved deeper into the issue, they found that the difference in ratings may be attributed to how individuals perceive activities while they are happening compared to how they remember them afterwards.
our experts chose the final insights after receiving nominations from our large network of almost 400 researchers.
we aim for these insights to provide comfort in knowing that challenges are common and to offer hope for the upcoming year.
have you ever been captivated by the beauty of a painting or the peacefulness of a local nature reserve?
do you enjoy engaging in conversations with others or relishing simple pleasures in life?
according to a study in nature human behavior in 2022, valuing these small moments can significantly increase our sense of purpose and meaning.
previous studies have shown that finding meaning in life is influenced by having a sense of purpose, feeling that one's life is significant, and perceiving the world as coherent.
however, this study suggests that valuing experiences might also be a significant contributor to a sense of meaning.
certainly, actively cultivating gratitude might prove more challenging in practice.
how can we learn to value and cherish the moments of our daily lives?
the researchers found that awe was a key factor in fostering appreciation in their study.
participants who watched a moving video displaying the beauty of nature reported feeling more grateful for their experiences, ultimately resulting in a deeper sense of purpose in life.
another suggestion is to value the simple joy of thinking on a daily basis, as research published in the journal of experimental psychology: general in 2022 revealed that we often fail to realize how much we can actually enjoy moments of introspection.
the concept of finding meaning may appear daunting and out of reach, but this study implies that it can be discovered in the little elements of life.
comfort can be sought in various ways in life, such as a comforting shower, a cozy snuggle with a cat, or a relaxing evening on the couch without any commitments.
scientists carried out five studies involving more than 2,100 individuals participating in activities focused on personal development, like taking improv classes, journaling about their feelings, or educating themselves on topics such as covid-19, gun violence, or conflicting political perspectives.
during the tasks, researchers instructed certain participants to deliberately aim to experience feelings of discomfort, unease, or even distress.
these individuals were encouraged to challenge their comfort levels and understand that experiencing discomfort indicated that the activity was effective.
for instance, students in improv classes embraced more time performing and taking on outlandish roles; writers were eager to create another heartfelt and introspective diary entry; and individuals were inspired to engage with complex yet enlightening news pieces.
this study indicates that we may be too quick to criticize typical human feelings such as anxiety, tension, and unease.
although our natural response may be to steer clear of these emotions, we could enhance our personal growth and lead a more fulfilling life by accepting them.
conscientiousness: our drive to achieve goals and take on responsibilities decreased.
the age group that experienced the most changes during the pandemic was younger adults.
among them, there was a significant decrease in agreeableness and conscientiousness, and a noticeable increase in neuroticism.
this indicates that they exhibited heightened feelings of anger, anxiety, irritability, and depression.
nevertheless, these results present a new perspective on mental health challenges.
despite the apparent difficulty of overcoming conditions like depression, many individuals not only manage to conquer them but also lead happy and fulfilling lives.
two studies conducted in 2022 suggest a possible remedy: feeling awe.
experiencing a feeling of amazement towards things that are greater than ourselves can lead us to broaden our scope of compassion and increase our inclination to behave as responsible members of the global community.
in a different study published by psychological science, researchers observed comparable advantages of feeling awe when individuals witnessed the 2017 solar eclipse.
by examining tweets from nearly 3 million twitter users during the eclipse, researchers discovered that individuals along the path of the eclipse showed more awe and used less self-centered language compared to those not in the path.
additionally, those who expressed more awe in their tweets also tended to use more language that was affiliative, humble, and collective when compared to their tweets before the eclipse.
combined, the research indicates that feelings of awe have the potential to expand our sense of empathy and solidarity by emphasizing our shared humanity and collective connection.
however, a study published in psychological bulletin in 2022 challenges this view.
in the end, studies revealed that younger age groups exhibited greater levels of cooperation and less selfish behavior compared to older age groups.
climate change is a daunting problem caused mainly by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, leading to long-term changes in temperature and weather patterns.
there are known solutions to address this issue, including improving transportation efficiency and transitioning to renewable energy sources.
two additional recent studies examined actions that individuals can take to protect themselves from believing and disseminating misinformation.
what prompted individuals to engage in more investigative behaviors was a characteristic known as intellectual humility, demonstrating an awareness that one's beliefs may be inaccurate.
by taking our intellectual humility quiz, you can receive suggestions on how to enhance your intellectual humility.
do individuals with depression have a more accurate perception of their level of control in life compared to others who may tend to be overly optimistic and perceive more control than they actually have?
the theory of depressive realism is worth testing due to its significant influence in various fields such as science, culture, and potential mental health treatment policies over the years.
this theory has been extensively referenced in numerous studies and research projects, showing its widespread impact.
the study was coauthored by moore along with amelia dev, who was the lead author and is currently a doctoral student at the university of miami.
the other authors included sheri johnson, a psychology professor at uc berkeley, and karin garrett, a former undergraduate student researcher.
the researchers incorporated advanced and improved measurements for the study, such as introducing a tool to assess bias and manipulating the level of control participants had in the experiment.
the researchers discovered that the college students' perception of control was not significantly affected by their levels of depression within the group.
moore suggests that although depression does not necessarily enhance decision-making skills, the larger question of accurately assessing our sense of control in different circumstances holds significance across different aspects of our lives.
fast forward nearly 100 years to the emergence of positive psychology, which was groundbreaking as it shifted focus from examining and treating individual dysfunction to exploring the behaviors and characteristics that lead to personal growth.
by emphasizing strengths, virtues, and well-being, positive psychology brought attention to areas of human thought and connection that had been overlooked by science for a long time.
happiness inequality was increasing in conjunction with income and wealth inequality before covid-19, according to the world happiness report.
the pandemic further exacerbated disparities in well-being among different groups.
researchers visited households in the ukrainian cities of kharkiv and lviv and conducted face-to-face interviews with nearly 1,300 participants, providing them with questionnaires containing ethically delicate questions to complete and return in sealed envelopes.
in countries affected by war, there is a harmful pattern where individuals who are continually exposed to news of conflict in nearby regions tend to experience higher levels of stress and depression, influencing their attitudes towards violence.
studies indicate that societies recovering from conflict are at a heightened risk of various forms of criminal violence such as domestic violence, theft, and homicide.
articles that investigate the origins of peace, conflict, and healing; provide guidance for leading a healthy and engaged life; and emphasize the inherent kindness of humanity.
in a separate research conducted by timmer and her team and featured in the british journal of criminology, similar surveys were utilized to reveal that individuals with greater exposure to war are more inclined to personally inflict harm on others.
similarly to the previous study, individuals experiencing higher levels of stress or negative emotions were more prone to view violence as a viable solution to conflicts.
a collection of essays where individuals seek to incorporate the principles of a fulfilling life into their everyday routines.
the paragraph discusses numerous instances where individuals have demonstrated remarkable courage and resilience in seemingly hopeless situations.
for instance, despite the bleak outlook following the dunkirk evacuation in 1940, numerous brave individuals defied the odds by embarking on small boats to cross the dangerous english channel.
additionally, the apollo 13 disaster serves as another example of overcoming adversity through courage, as scientists faced insurmountable challenges following an explosion on the spacecraft.
in dire circumstances, the choice often comes down to either summoning courage or succumbing to defeat.
courage may not be as easily shared as hope, but once acquired, it becomes a potent and positive influence.
it is more than just standing against environmental issues; it is also about confronting difficult situations and turning them into opportunities for raising awareness.
it involves being aware of the challenges and possibilities of a changing world and facing them with a sense of purpose.
when i sense despair encroaching, i pause to reflect on what we aim to safeguard and to mourn what we've forfeited.
these are typical emotions when confronting significant changes, and it's crucial to acknowledge and process them at your own pace.
if the constant pressure and gloom of the media become overwhelming, i opt to stroll in the berkeley hills, kayak, or leisurely wander my local streets, focusing on the birds' songs and the comforting shelter of an oak tree.
isaac addae, a business professor, grew up in a family of ghanaian immigrants who were known for their generosity.
from a young age, he was inspired to make a difference in the world and was determined to devote his life to serving others.
however, experts acknowledge that achieving these effects hinges on striking a healthy equilibrium between altruism and taking care of oneself.
after recognizing that her excessive dedication was draining her energy for other tasks, oakley pondered on ways to reduce her level of involvement while still assisting her students.
by encouraging students to seek help from their peers before reaching out to her, she saw a decrease in demands on her time and was able to focus on supporting students with pressing issues.
challenging your traditional beliefs about generosity can also assist you in breaking free from a repetitive negative pattern.
to put it differently, the common assumptions about baby boomers being self-centered and generation z being compassionate may not always hold true.
additionally, these stereotypes can lead to an overreliance on younger generations to address issues like climate change, rather than acknowledging the responsibility shared by all individuals to take action.
in summary, to improve the world and ensure the prosperity of future generations, we must move past stereotypes and avoid fostering conflicts between generations, as this benefits no one.
rather, we should seek more opportunities to unite and bond, collaborating on the important task of creating a better world for both present and future individuals.
some time ago, i surveyed a group of adults and had them reflect on various disagreements they have with others, ranging from minor to significant issues.
following that, i inquired about their perception of the portion of these disagreements where they believe they are right.
i doubt my own beliefs, stances, and perspectives as they may be incorrect.
i enjoy discovering new information that challenges my existing beliefs.
according to our research, individuals with high levels of intellectual humility tend to be more discerning when evaluating the evidence presented in an article regarding the benefits of dental flossing.
their ability to differentiate between reliable and unreliable information on the topic stems from their awareness that their beliefs could potentially be inaccurate.
thus, intellectually humble individuals prioritize scrutinizing the quality of evidence supporting their beliefs.
intellectual humility is closely linked with a willingness to acquire new knowledge.
those who exhibit high levels of intellectual humility show greater interest in seeking out new information, as evident in their strong desire for intellectual curiosity.
this curiosity appears to stem from both their enjoyment of acquiring knowledge and their discomfort when faced with gaps in knowledge or understanding.
additionally, individuals with high intellectual humility tend to display a greater enjoyment in engaging in critical thinking, pondering complex issues, and solving intellectual challenges compared to those with lower levels of intellectual humility.
research suggests that individuals high in intellectual humility tend to refrain from criticizing those with differing opinions, while those low in this trait tend to react emotionally to disagreement and may belittle those with differing views.
this essay marks the beginning of a three-year project by the ggsc to promote awareness of research on intellectual humility and its significance.
aside from exacerbating disputes and generating resentment, a lack of intellectual humility can lead to real-world challenges.
those who are closed-minded towards differing opinions can hinder open and sincere conversations.
for instance, leaders who do not welcome diverse perspectives may prevent group members from sharing their thoughts, potentially impeding innovative and beneficial ideas.
conversely, leaders who are humble and open to alternative viewpoints can encourage others to participate more actively in discussions.
intellectual humility offers individuals personal, practical, and societal advantages.
however, the factors that influence why some individuals exhibit more intellectual humility than others remain mostly unexplored due to limited research on the topic.
nonetheless, findings from related fields can offer some insights for speculation on this matter.
because most personal traits have some genetic component, it is not unexpected that intellectual humility may also be partially influenced by genetics.
this is supported by the correlation between intellectual humility, overconfidence, and openness, all of which have genetic factors at play.
certain ideologies may not encourage people to exhibit intellectual humility.
for instance, many religions assert that they are the sole possessors of the truth and discourage individuals from questioning the validity of their beliefs.
it should be noted that individuals who do not adhere to any religious beliefs may also lack intellectual humility; atheists, for example, may be just as resolute in their convictions as religious extremists.
regrettably, many of us tend to overestimate the correctness of our beliefs and viewpoints, often without considering the potential for error.
however, individuals can develop greater intellectual humility by choosing to be more open-minded and through interventions that challenge their overconfidence, leading them to become more humble intellectually.
i had an in-depth conversation with grinker about mental illness, its historical context, and ways in which various groups can work together to promote changes in societal perceptions and norms surrounding mental health.
jn: in my book, divergent mind, i examine how mental health diagnoses became more prevalent during the growth of capitalism and british colonialism.
my work has a modern perspective that focuses on how women were pathologized.
i am interested in exploring the connection between capitalism and the societal stigma surrounding mental illness.
jn: people with neurodivergences are likened to canaries in the coal mine, signaling the need for society to adopt alternative lifestyles and distance itself from harmful aspects of contemporary culture.

typically, these narratives start with the perpetrator acknowledging the harm done, followed by a section detailing how they came to realize their contribution to the damage.
the narratives conclude with the individual accepting responsibility for their actions and committing to making amends.
currently, i see the need to simultaneously destroy and construct bridges.
these actions are essential to navigating a world after trump's presidency.

i had a conversation with price discussing why we have unrealistic expectations for ourselves, the negative impacts this can have, and potential solutions to address it.
devon price argues in their book that it is important for people to consider logically whether individuals have control over their levels of motivation.
they emphasize that no one willingly chooses to experience emotions like depression, exhaustion, or burnout.
i strongly believe in the importance of individuals taking time to assess their personal values rather than conforming to societal expectations.
it is crucial for people to reflect on what they genuinely desire their lives to be like.
how can people fight against the habit of categorizing themselves or others as lazy in javascript?
at greater good, we focus on studying social and emotional well-being research and aim to assist individuals in implementing these findings in their personal and work lives.
we understand the challenges inherent in our field.
is it feasible for a person without a scientific background to find a middle ground between entirely rejecting and blindly accepting scientific information?
are there warning signs to be alert to when reviewing a study on platforms like greater good or hearing about one on a fox news segment?
when reading a primary research study, how can a non-scientist assess its trustworthiness effectively?
here are 11 inquiries you could consider when reviewing the most recent scientific discoveries related to the pandemic, inspired by our research at greater good.
animal studies provide valuable information to scientists, but their direct relevance to human daily life is limited.
similarly, if research exclusively focuses on males, the findings may not apply to females, and vice versa.
this pertains to the covid-19 vaccines currently being distributed globally.
side effects are expected with any medication, including vaccines.
the severity of these side effects can vary among individuals based on factors such as genetics, health condition, age, upbringing, and living environment.
hass is contemplating whether the potential negative impacts of the side effects could outweigh the overall harm of covid-19 for the majority of people.
typically, a study's results are considered more reliable with a greater number of participants.
however, for certain types of research, having a large sample size may not always be feasible or recommended.
due to time limitations imposed by the covid-19 pandemic, the size of study samples has been restricted.
although researchers aim to make fair comparisons and account for various variables in their analyses, conducting a study requires balancing what can be achieved based on the study design with how broadly the results can be applied.
ultimately, it is crucial to correctly determine the connection between factors.
this is key in comprehending measures to combat the transmission of covid-19 such as shelter-in-place directives.
merely demonstrating that increased adherence to shelter-in-place guidelines was linked to reduced hospitalization rates is not as definitive as proving that a specific community that implemented shelter-in-place rules had lower hospitalization rates compared to another similar community that chose not to.
the foundation of the scientific method lies in continuously advancing and incorporating new findings in research.
scientists rely on previous studies to shape their own investigations, recognizing that each study contributes to a lineage of knowledge that will be further developed in the future.
as you review a study, consider whether the researchers appropriately discuss and give credit to previous research and insights from diverse fields that influence their work and interpretations of results.
this was important for the discussions about mask mandates and social distancing.
existing knowledge about the effectiveness of both practices in preventing infections, based on centuries of practical experience and research, was well-established.
in summary, we should adopt a mindset of curiosity and skepticism when approaching new studies.
it is important to treat all research with seriousness but also maintain a healthy level of skepticism.
it is valuable to compare new information with our own experiences, but we must be cautious of our biases.
cultivating humility, doubt, and patience is key, acknowledging that we may not always be successful in doing so.
it is important to embrace self-awareness, acknowledging our mistakes and practicing self-forgiveness.
with this information in mind, what is the reason behind people's reluctance to follow basic health recommendations, such as wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and adhering to stay-at-home orders issued by local authorities to prevent overwhelming hospitals?
since the start of the pandemic, numerous individuals have attempted to downplay its effects, frequently with political motives.
their claims are based on flawed calculations, inadequate data, or unrealistic optimism.
in a survey conducted by political scientists clifton van der linden and justin savoie in april of this year, they discovered that canadians were more inclined to wear masks when motivated by the idea of protecting others rather than themselves.
similarly, a recent study in sweden revealed that individuals who displayed generosity in an economics game were more inclined to educate themselves about the virus, wear masks, and practice social distancing.
that being said, there are numerous ways to mishandle these interventions.
even though research shows that lockdowns can prevent fatalities, many experts suggest that they should be a final option after exploring all other avenues.
this means it could be acceptable to maintain operations in businesses and schools, but only with strict enforcement of mask-wearing, widespread access to reliable testing, and extensive contact tracing.
unfortunately, in many parts of the united states, this level of coordination and precaution has been lacking to say the least.
in the book the semisovereign people published in 1960, elmer e.
schattschneider, a political scientist, contended that economic inequality acted as a means of disenfranchising voters.
he believed that this occurred as the wealthy and affluent could influence the discussion and manipulate outcomes to favor their own interests due to their economic advantage.
this perception that the political system primarily prioritized their needs could discourage lower-income and working-class individuals from engaging in the political process.
the main point is that inequality significantly reduces voting rates among low-income individuals, as demonstrated by recent studies.
a fresh examination of polling data for the 2020 election by fivethirtyeight further supports this finding, showing a correlation between lower incomes and lower voter turnout.
researchers at harvard university conducted a study in 2001, analyzing the data from the current population survey for the years 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996.
their findings revealed a correlation between high voting inequality among different socioeconomic groups in states and the likelihood of individuals reporting fair or poor health.
this connection between inequality, health status, and voting patterns was also observed in various other countries.
to validate the connection between disparities in health and political engagement, aaron reeves and johan mackenbach analyzed voter registration and health information from 17 european nations.
their research revealed a direct relationship between unequal participation in politics and increased health disparities.
furthermore, individuals facing health issues might have limited access to the usual resources that would encourage them to participate in voting.
this could lead to them becoming disconnected from their communities, spending less time in communal areas, or not being effectively reached through voter registration campaigns.
a recent study by steven o.
roberts, an assistant professor of psychology at stanford university, revealed that discussions about race are lacking in leading psychological publications.
the study, published in perspectives on psychological science, found that only a small number of prominent psychological publications focus on race, and when race is addressed, it is predominantly written and edited by white scholars.
the researchers examined photos of editors and authors online, mainly from faculty webpages, to identify their race.
they emailed the individuals to confirm their self-reported racial identity and validate the researchers' initial assessments.
the racial composition of editors-in-chief differed across different areas of psychology.
in cognitive psychology, which focuses on mental processes such as perception, memory, thinking, attention, and language, there has never been an editor of color in either of the journals.
roberts suggests that cognitive psychologists might steer clear of studying race because they focus on examining universal, race-neutral phenomena.
the researchers also considered if the difference could be accounted for by the number of white authors.
if there are more white authors, they should be more prevalent in all journals.
however, roberts discovered that in less prestigious specialized journals, white authors were actually not as prevalent as expected.
roberts suggests that journals should first communicate a strong commitment to diversity from the top down.
this includes clearly indicating if the journal showcases research that embraces diversity and values the involvement of diverse scientists in editing, writing, and contributing to the journal.
additional suggestions include involving a wide range of individuals at various stages of the publication process, examining the diversity of research subjects during reviews, publishing yearly reports on diversity, and creating a team dedicated to promoting diversity.
roberts suggests that authors have the power to influence change by including a thorough explanation and rationale for the racial composition of their research subjects, a practice that is not widely seen in traditional psychology publications.
roberts wants this project to acknowledge the hard work of numerous psychologists over the years who have often been overlooked when it comes to having their research published in prestigious journals.
other cities are contemplating similar actions.
for example, los angeles has already redirected some of its police budget to community programs.
a number of people acknowledge the deep-seated issue of racial profiling in law enforcement, which has led to higher rates of arrests, imprisonment, and violence against african americans.
they believe that these problems are ingrained in the system and that only a complete restructuring of the police force can address the issue.
additionally, concerns have been raised about the escalating expenses of policing without a substantial improvement in public safety, as well as the impact of police unions in preserving existing practices.
if the city shifts funds from the police department to community investments, will it enhance public safety?
there could be additional underlying problems within law enforcement that have not been explored through research on reform efforts.
while ward is optimistic about the initiatives requiring police officers to step in if they witness a colleague misusing their authority, he acknowledges that this will be a significant challenge for them to implement.
for instance, in one of the studies, it was discovered that the instances of violent misconduct among sheriffs increased when they were allowed to form unions.
another research found that police officers who were dismissed from one department were frequently rehired by other departments, and these rehired officers were more likely to engage in repeated misconduct in their new roles.
these concerns suggest that there are fundamental problems within police departments that may require a complete overhaul.
ward suggests that it is logical to reconsider and reshape a system and environment that dehumanizes individuals involved in criminal activities, while also glorifying law enforcement in an unhealthy manner.
in camden, new jersey, in 2013, the city faced challenges due to high crime rates and limited finances, prompting officials to dissolve the police department and union and implement a new strategy.
they adopted community policing, fostering better cooperation between law enforcement and residents, while also directing resources towards public services.
this approach led to a significant decrease in crime rates.
certainly, camden serves as just one illustration of how this approach can be implemented.
however, studies indicate that emphasizing community health could be more crucial in preventing crime than relying solely on aggressive policing tactics.
criminologists travis pratt and francis cullen from the university of cincinnati conducted a meta-analysis of more than 200 studies to examine the correlation between various community and police force factors and crime rates.
research shows that improving education in communities is linked to lower crime rates.
after-school programs that emphasize social skills and character education can also deter youth delinquency, indicating that investing in these programs could enhance public safety.
increasing access to healthcare has been shown to lead to a decrease in crime rates, as evidenced by the link between expanding medicaid and reduced crime.
additionally, the availability of drug treatment facilities in communities has also been connected to lower crime rates.
by enhancing healthcare access, we can effectively enhance public health and diminish crime levels.
ward points out that although racism disproportionately impacts african americans and other communities of color, the negative effects are not limited to them.
he argues that existing in a society tainted by racism and prioritizing white supremacy over the well-being of all citizens ultimately harms everyone.
the thought of these incidents looms heavily in the thoughts of the many individuals who participated in demonstrations against police violence and advocating for change in the aftermath of george floyd's death.
floyd, an african-american man in minneapolis, died after a police officer kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes.
his tragic death invoked memories of philando castile, another black man who was fatally shot by a police officer during a traffic stop in minnesota back in 2016.
for example, a significant number of americans have been influenced by negative depictions of arabs or muslims in the media and entertainment, leading to the tendency to stereotype them as extremists or terrorists.
similarly, throughout history, black men have also been subject to this phenomenon.
with repeated exposure to portrayals of black men as criminals, research indicates that we are more inclined to perceive them in this light.
can this knowledge and hands-on experience help to decrease incidents of police violence against the black community?
essentially, when individuals stereotype others, it can heighten the risk of violence.
police officers can also be affected by the societal culture they are a part of, with research indicating that a more racially biased society can result in biased policing.
a study conducted in 2017 by eric hehman et al.
examined the racial biases of over two million americans and their connection to police use of lethal force against african americans.
the findings suggested that police in areas where white residents held stronger implicit racial biases were more prone to using lethal force against black individuals.
meindl and his team discovered that individuals who support the concept of hard work tend to prefer concentrated power, whereas those in favor of wealth redistribution advocate for a more equitable distribution of power.
in simpler terms, both groups are influenced by fundamental beliefs about the ideal society rather than just self-interest.
those who prioritize maximizing well-being and happiness tend to value equality and distributive justice based on needs, while those who prioritize societal power tend to favor rewarding merit as a means to achieve their goals.

this is a remarkable time in the field of education, as old ways of thinking are rapidly being dismantled worldwide.
this presents educators with a chance to influence the future generation to be more aware socially, emotionally, and morally.
greater good in education provides complimentary evidence-based and well-informed methods and techniques aimed at enhancing students' social, emotional, and ethical growth, supporting the well-being of educators, and fostering positive school environments.
for the creation of ggie, we held discussions with professionals, scholars, and developers deeply involved in this field.
we were impressed by the difficulties they encounter.
while there is no perfect solution, we specifically tailored ggie to address these challenges.
for this reason, ggie provides a diverse range of practices focused on various prosocial skills, instead of a fixed curriculum.
educators are encouraged to select practices that align with their students' needs and their own values when teaching.
ggie has a special part called my well-being that focuses on the health of staff and teachers.
it covers techniques like mindfulness, self-compassion, and gratitude to help enhance adult social-emotional skills.
ggie contributes to creating a positive atmosphere in schools.
research indicates that building trust among educators is crucial for improving schools.
developing strong relationships where everyone supports each other is essential for nurturing trust.
english teachers can assist students in cultivating empathy by analyzing the motivations and traits of characters, as outlined in the method of promoting empathy through literature.
history educators have the opportunity to encourage gratitude by engaging students in the people who made a difference activity.
this exercise encourages students to investigate historical figures who have made positive contributions to society and to show appreciation for their efforts.
the use of drawing serves as a method for art teachers to incorporate emotion regulation techniques into their lessons.
the participants were asked to decide whether they would remove oxygen from the current patient to save others if they were in control, and they were also asked to evaluate the morality of this decision.
those who were encouraged to think about the value of information were more likely to choose to remove oxygen from the patient and considered this decision to be more morally justified compared to those who were not prompted.
joshua greene, a co-author of the study, is optimistic about the findings.
the results suggest that individuals have the capacity to set aside their natural reluctance to make morally sound decisions, particularly when these decisions bring about greater benefits for a larger group of people.
during the survey, some participants were randomly asked to choose true or false within 11 seconds, while others were told to delay their response for at least 11 seconds.
a third group received no specific time instructions and completed the survey at their own pace.
the study at ucsb revealed that individuals who answered questions in less than 11 seconds tended to have higher scores in social desirability.
essentially, when given a short amount of time to respond, they portrayed themselves as more kind and helpful.
conversely, when provided with more time, participants tended to depict themselves in a more selfish manner.
the reason why the belated good samaritan teachers did not offer assistance is still a topic of contemplation.
while results from real-life observations might differ from conclusions drawn in controlled experiments or surveys, recent studies suggest an alternative explanation.
it is proposed that arriving slightly less late could also be considered a compassionate act towards others.
the theology students might have chosen not to help the single person in need in order to better cater to the wider audience in the lecture hall.
this situation is not an instance where unethical behavior triumphed, but rather a scenario where hurried individuals made a utilitarian decision to maximize their positive impact on a larger group of people.
the cameras monitored busy areas like public transit stations, shops, and streets where gatherings of people occurred.
the study only considered video footage that depicted aggressive incidents without the initial presence of police or emergency services.
franco suggests that the new project should be examined in the context of numerous psychological studies conducted over several decades that support the concept of the bystander effect on individuals.
some experts are skeptical about the level of helpfulness that bystanders exhibit, despite the findings of recent research.
although the study may have increased the reported rates of assistance, philpot suggests that there may have been overlooked verbal interventions that were not captured in the video footage.
previous research has presented conflicting findings on the frequency of bystander intervention in public conflicts.
for example, one study from 1983 found that bystanders attempted to intervene in just 11 percent of cases.
however, other studies have shown higher rates of bystander assistance, such as observations of barroom attacks where bystanders intervened around one-third of the time.
another recent review of police case files revealed that bystanders stepped in to help in nearly 75 percent of public attack incidents.
view psychologist philip zimbardo and award-winning photographer ted jackson as they explore the bystander effect, altruism, and the capacity for heroism that exists in each one of us.
nevertheless, humans have the ability to learn and adjust based on their experiences in response to changing aspects of their environment.
in times of danger, our focus shifts towards self-preservation instincts rather than social interactions.
typically, individuals tend to prioritize immediate risks and desires as well as maintaining a positive personal and social image.
this behavior helps ensure safety and smooth social interactions.
however, there are situations where without supervision or input from others, our brains may make errors in judgment.
although stories like this one may lead to negative feelings, they also offer valuable chances for contemplation and education.
is it possible that elements of mainstream culture and lifestyle, in addition to receiving poor legal guidance, influenced their decision and made it appear justified?
even though the williamses made a mistake, given all the circumstances, can you honestly claim that you would have made a different choice?
following his graduation from college, psychologist michael reichert provided counseling services at family court where he assisted in making decisions for numerous teenage boys involved in delinquent behaviors such as theft, violence, and escaping from home.
as he reviewed various reports from police and educational institutions, he frequently observed the significant number of offenders who had undergone severe hardships and neglectful situations.
fortunately, there is also positive news.
reichert provides valuable advice for parents aiming to guide young boys towards becoming empathetic men.
his suggestions emphasize forming strong connections with boys, fostering their independence, and prioritizing their emotional development.
here are a few of his suggested strategies.
the exceptional skills and star power of a talented individual can elevate a business to new heights, as demonstrated by the significant decisions recently made by soccer icon david beckham.
anita elberse strolls with authentic brands ceo jamie salter and soccer legend david beckham at the harvard business school campus.
in 2023, beckham enhanced his skills by actively recruiting argentinian star lionel messi to join his miami team.
messi, who had recently won the world cup, was a highly coveted player by many clubs internationally.
despite efforts by beckham and other investors to boost us soccer, the sport still lagged behind domestic favorites such as football and baseball.

in october, an israeli tank crew fired two shells at a clearly marked group of journalists in lebanon, resulting in the death of a reuters reporter.
the crew then likely continued to shoot at them with a heavy machine gun for almost two minutes, according to a report released on thursday.
reuters was unable to confirm whether the israeli tank crew was aware that they were targeting journalists, or if they additionally used a machine gun to shoot at them, and if so, the reason behind it remains unknown.
both of the remaining reuters journalists and another afp reporter present did not recall hearing the sound of the machine gun.
they all mentioned being in a state of shock during that moment.
according to international humanitarian law, journalists are protected as civilians and cannot be targeted during attacks because they are not considered military objectives.
"we strongly denounce the assault on a group of journalists who were clearly identifiable and working openly.
our colleague issam abdallah lost his life in the attack, and several others were injured.
we urge israel to provide an explanation for this tragic event and to ensure that those accountable are held responsible," stated reuters editor-in-chief alessandra galloni.
afp global news director, phil chetwynd, emphatically repeated his request for a comprehensive and open investigation to be carried out by the israeli military.
he stated that if the reports of continuous machine gun fire are verified, it would further support the idea that this was a purposeful and planned assault.
ihtisham hibatullah, who is in charge of international communications at al jazeera, called on the israeli government to reveal the results of its own inquiry.
"this incident clearly suggests a deliberate act of targeting, as substantiated by various investigations, including those conducted by tno," he stated.
tno observed that the seven journalists were clad in blue protective gear, with "press" marked on their vests in white letters.
they were capturing footage of cross-border shelling from a vantage point on a hill close to the lebanese village of alma al-chaab for almost an hour prior to the incident.
video recordings of the incident aftermath also displayed a black vehicle owned by reuters, with the word "tv" prominently displayed in large yellow tape letters on both the hood and the roof.
tno mentioned that there was a direct visual connection between the location of the tank rounds being fired and the area where the attack occurred.
in the video footage broadcasted before the attack, there were sounds of drones possibly present, and an israeli helicopter could be seen flying above in certain clips.
the institute pinpointed the origin of the two tank rounds by utilizing video footage capturing the second round's muzzle blast and trajectory, along with audio recordings gathered at the scene of the event.
nonetheless, the rapid succession of gunfire following the tank rounds, combined with the examination, convinced tno that it was probable both originated from the same source.
the institute did not present any alternative explanations for the origin of the machine gun shots.
approximately half a minute after the second tank round, a machine gun fired around 25 shots, followed by bursts of nine and 12 shots.
after another 30 seconds, three shots were heard, followed by a single shot and a metallic ping sound, possibly caused by a bullet hitting a nearby low wall according to tno.
the attack also caused injuries to reuters photographer thaier al-sudani, aged 47, cameraman maher nazeh, aged 53, and two journalists from al jazeera, along with another journalist from afp.
some of the experts who examined the tno report for reuters had differing opinions on whether the tank crew intentionally aimed at journalists.
jessica dorsey, an expert in international humanitarian law at utrecht university, stated that the tno report suggests that machine gun fire from the same location likely accompanied the two tank rounds, indicating a deliberate targeting of the victims.
she believed that from a legal standpoint, if the matter ended up in court, it would further strengthen the argument that the incident constituted a war crime.
yet, nick kaufman, a lawyer from britain and israel who has a background serving in the idf military advocate general's corps and has defended prominent clients accused of war crimes at international criminal courts, stated that the reason for the tank firing at the journalists remained uncertain.
israel's military announced that they have footage of the attack and are currently conducting an investigation, but no findings have been shared with the public yet.
even if you are highly accomplished or just average, women continue to bear the greatest burdens and make significant sacrifices at home, stated the feminist, who was 28 years old, during a conversation at a cafe in xian, a city in the northwest.
"she told reuters that in past generations, many individuals, particularly women, made sacrifices in their careers and personal lives after getting married, only to find that the promised happy life did not materialize.
nowadays, living a fulfilling life is already challenging on its own." president xi jinping emphasized the importance of developing a new culture around marriage and having children in response to the decline in china's population for the second year in a row, with record low birth rates.
chinese premier li qiang committed to creating a society that supports childbirth and improving childcare services in the government work report for this year.
the communist party considers the nuclear family essential for societal stability, stigmatizing unmarried mothers and limiting their access to benefits.
however, an increasing number of well-educated women are embracing "singleism" due to rising economic uncertainties, high youth unemployment, and a downturn in the economy.
after years of enhancing women's education, employment rates, and social status, chinese officials are now grappling with a challenge as these women are growing more defiant towards their propaganda.
in china, the trend of people living alone for an extended period is growing, leading to the emergence of online groups where single women predominantly connect with one another for mutual support and understanding.
female influencers in their thirties or forties on xiaohongshu, a chinese social media platform similar to instagram, frequently receive thousands of likes on posts containing the hashtag "no marriage, no children." one online community on douban that is against marriage has 9,200 members, and another platform dedicated to promoting the idea of singleism has 3,600 members who engage in discussions about shared retirement plans and other related topics.
liao yueyi, a 24-year-old college graduate who is currently unemployed in the city of nanning in the south, recently confessed to her mother that she frequently has bad dreams about the idea of having children.
she shared on wechat that her choice to not get married or have children was made after careful thought.
she stated that she does not feel the need to apologize to anyone, as her parents have come to accept her decision.
instead, she has chosen to adopt the chinese concept of "lying flat," which involves doing the minimum required to get by, in order to save money for future trips.
she mentioned that she believes it is acceptable to date or live together, but sees children as requiring a significant investment with few benefits.
she also mentioned considering the idea of sharing a house with female friends once they all retire.
a significant number of women who were interviewed mentioned that they preferred to focus on self-discovery, were disenchanted with traditional chinese family structures dominated by men, and were unable to find supportive male partners as the primary reasons they chose to remain unmarried and without children.
gender parity was found to be a factor, as every woman noted the challenge of finding a partner who respected their independence and supported an equal sharing of household responsibilities.
although not all of the women interviewed identified as feminists or saw themselves as purposefully going against the government, their behaviors are indicative of a larger pattern of chinese women's empowerment shown through individual decisions.
some experts argue that while the number of individuals remaining single for life may not dramatically increase in the future, the trends of postponed marriages and declining fertility could still challenge china's demographic aspirations.
during a press briefing at a yearly parliamentary gathering in beijing, wang emphasized that communication and cooperation between the two countries can persist only if there is mutual respect and acknowledgment of their diverse viewpoints.
wang announced that china plans to present a proposed resolution on artificial intelligence to the united nations general assembly.
the resolution will address the importance of balancing advancements in ai technology with considerations for security.
beijing is dealing with ongoing geopolitical tensions on various fronts, such as trade with europe, the conflict in ukraine, various issues with japan, and disputes with the philippines over the south china sea, which is a focal point for conflicting territorial claims in the region.
wang expressed china's readiness to collaborate with russia to promote new opportunities for cooperation and strengthen their friendship.
china and russia established an unrestricted partnership in february 2022 during putin's visit to beijing, shortly before he deployed thousands of troops into ukraine, which led to the most lethal land conflict in europe since world war two.
china has agreed to waive the visa requirement for citizens from 22 countries, with the most recent additions being thailand, singapore, and malaysia.
china has decided to grant citizens from countries like germany, france, spain, the netherlands, and italy visa-free entry for 15 days.
however, despite this gesture, these european countries have not extended the same visa-free entry privilege to chinese citizens.
according to valisure, the discovery of benzene in the acne treatment products stood out as notably distinct from the other instances identified.
valisure found that certain products had the potential to exceed the fda's allowable limit for benzene by over 800 times in their tests.
criticism from competitors and customers, as well as warnings from regulatory agencies, indicate that a few of the six companies may face regulatory scrutiny due to possible non-compliance in the near future.
however, the addition of new charges, like a "core technology fee" of 50 euro cents per user account annually, has drawn the attention of the eu antitrust chief margrethe vestager, even if developers choose not to utilize apple's app store or payment platform.
competitors like proton, a swiss email service, have expressed their opinion that apple's efforts to comply with regulations are insufficient.
in the event that a company's overall revenues surpass its total costs, it is considered to be earning supernormal profits.
these profits serve as an incentive for firms to enhance their competitiveness, provide rewards to entrepreneurs, and facilitate the more efficient allocation of limited resources.

i've reached out to local second-hand bookstores for help, and doe books suggested a book search service in springfield which i'm waiting to hear from.
i will continue to search for another undamaged copy for you, but i apologize and ask for your understanding in the meantime.
to address speculation, the management would like to clarify that there will be no christmas bonus this year due to financial constraints amid the economic downturn.
this decision has been made to avoid laying off employees or reducing working hours.

however, i ask that my role be restricted to the event only.
additionally, i would appreciate a written agreement outlining how my name will be utilized in your promotional materials.
our family always eagerly awaits the annual springfield festival and we are expecting another wonderful event this year.
i am writing in reference to the advertisement in the doe post seeking applicants for a chemical engineering position.

i have experience working on various projects related to polymerization processes and am currently researching how polyethylene products can be used in aeronautical applications.
my passion for plastics was ignited during my time at doe university, where i focused my graduate thesis on the historical uses of polyethylene.
i have attached my resume and am eager for the chance to have a face-to-face interview.
i recently had a discussion with jane doe regarding the clinical director role at your facility.
both of us believe that this position aligns well with my professional objectives and skills.
for six years, i served as the clinical coordinator overseeing two 26-bed units at the springfield facility.
during this time, i introduced two innovative programs that have since become commonly utilized in clinical treatment.
my advanced training in clinical research at springfield university has equipped me to oversee the experimental departments at the primary clinic.
for further information about my qualifications and background, please refer to the enclosed resume.
i look forward to meeting you to explore how my skills and experience align with your requirements.
my time in the english department has equipped me to write effectively for diverse audiences, and i have successfully published a significant amount of my creative writing.
doe's mentorship, i have focused on incorporating writing into my work in archaeology.
given the current financial constraints and conflicts regarding land use, it is crucial for archaeology to have skilled writers who can make the subject engaging to the public.
i am submitting my application for the teaching job advertised in the springfield herald.
as outlined in my attached resume, i have extensive experience as an english teacher and have recently obtained my master's degree from springfield university, where my studies were focused on adult education, culminating in my thesis research in this field.

more information about these additional courses can be found in my resume.
i went to your springfield showroom last saturday and purchased an oak desk along with two matching three-drawer filing cabinets for my study.
today, when i returned home, i discovered that the furniture had been delivered in my absence.
however, the filing cabinets sent were of the four-drawer variety, which i am unable to use due to space constraints.
i would be grateful if you could promptly arrange to pick up the cabinets and exchange them for the ones i initially ordered.
kindly contact me to schedule a convenient time for the exchange when i will be available at home.
i am hopeful that this issue can be swiftly resolved to allow me to organize my files promptly.
i placed an order for letterhead stationery for our main office in springfield on march 17.
we received the delivery within a week, however, the letterhead contained the address of a different company.
in the recent spring season, i opted for a yard waste recycling bin and promptly settled the required payment when it was delivered.
i was under the impression that the collected waste would be disposed of at the city's recycling location every monday.
however, i have noticed that my yard waste is instead being mixed with the general household trash and taken to the landfill.
this situation undermines the trust i had in the service.
i kindly ask for the proper recycling of the yard waste or a refund for the service provided.
i wish to report a complaint about the unreasonable traffic enforcement measures taken in the last three thursday evenings at the main and elm streets intersection in springfield.
on thursdays, there is an event held at doe's tavern called "cruise in," where participants gather to showcase their customized cars and motorcycles, enjoying discounted tacos with proceeds going to charity.
however, for the past three weeks, police have blocked off elm street at main to prevent traffic congestion, leading to longer detours and backups causing frustration among participants.
this enforcement has created more conflict between drivers and law enforcement than in the event's entire four-year history.
a formal review of this practice is requested, focusing on its effectiveness and considering reasonable alternatives if the police aim to manage the event differently.
we appreciate the invitation to jane's graduation celebration and are excited to reunite with all of you.
this event will make our reunion even more meaningful.
we are excited to spend this time with you and to get to know jane and her husband better.
i was happy to receive your invitation to jane's retirement party.

it has come to your attention that john doe has agreed to take on a role in kansas as the sales director for doe corporation.
i am thrilled for john's new opportunity, but we will deeply feel his absence in springfield.
his optimistic outlook and high level of energy have truly contributed to creating a welcoming work environment in our office.
at this time, i do not intend to replace john.
jane doe will take over all of his clients' responsibilities.
it is with a blend of feelings that i share the news of jane doe's retirement, our long-time department secretary.
for 37 years, she has been dedicated to her role, and we will definitely miss her presence and contribution.
jane's ability to focus on details without losing sight of the big picture has proven to be very beneficial.
her dedication to meeting deadlines by putting in extra effort shows her commitment to delivering high-quality work.
i am thankful for her support in keeping me organized, on schedule, and on budget.
aside from her expertise, jane's kindness and subtle motivation have made her a respected colleague and friend to everyone.
please be informed that starting on march 1, there will be changes to sales territories and quotas, as detailed in the attached document.
while some adjustments may appear unusual, please note that they were made thoughtfully.
a key issue prompting these changes is the significant amount of time sales representatives spend away from their families.
this situation causes stress for both the employees and their families, as well as the company.
the modifications aim to reduce this stress and are intended to benefit everyone involved.
your feedback and ideas are valued as we navigate through this transition.
we expect sales to rise following this modification, as we will have more time for selling and less time for travel.
best wishes to all in their new roles.
if you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out.
because of john doe's request, we are changing your management duties.
we value and support your decision to move to springfield to be close to your sick mother.
john will take charge of the centerville operations.
the springfield role remains unchanged, so you will be comfortable in that position.
it is believed that this change is beneficial for you, and it is hoped that you will assist john with your knowledge as he takes over.
if you have any queries regarding the relocation, jane from the personnel department will be able to help you.
i kindly ask that you amend our notice to accurately show the value on which we will be taxed.
if this message does not provide adequate justification for the correction, please advise on the required steps.
i am hopeful that this adjustment can be completed before my tax deadline.
i am advocating for the uniform tax bill, as a small business owner supporting five full-time employees and my family of six.
as a member of the middle class, i understand the significant tax burden we shoulder and i am willing to pay my fair share.
after a thorough review of the uniform tax bill, i believe it would distribute the tax burden more evenly.
i disagree with the notion that high-income earners would not contribute their fair share under this legislation.
i urge you to utilize your influence to back this bill, as many others like me are rallying local support for it.
i wish us all success in our efforts.
the clerk's responsibilities include maintaining precise court documents, supervising the court clerk's tasks, managing voter registration, and coordinating election schedules.
john is aware of the significance of maintaining meticulous records and having positive interactions with the community.
he is trustworthy, dependable, and prepared to dedicate the hours required for the role.
in my opinion, john doe is the most capable individual to serve as our next county clerk.
i am enthusiastically endorsing jane doe as the candidate for delegate to the state assembly on behalf of our party.
this section presents a positive outlook on the advancement of philosophy.
it suggests that historical evidence supports the idea of progress, provided that we understand what philosophical issues are and how to resolve them.
the author concludes by questioning why many individuals lean towards a negative perspective on the progress of philosophy.
one of the most well-known philosophical issues is represented by exhibit a, which is the mind-body problem articulated by descartes.
in his works like the meditations, descartes argued that the presence of consciousness conflicts with materialistic beliefs, leading to the assertion of a form of dualism.
fellow philosophers of his time, such as thomas hobbes, antoine arnauld, and princess elisabeth of bohemia, raised objections to descartes' arguments in different manners.
naturally, these are just two examples, but they are fundamental ones.
it's difficult to find two problems in philosophy more significant than descartes' mind-body problem and hume's induction problem.
additionally, the instances provided serve as a clear demonstration of a widespread approach often used to resolve philosophical issues.
these issues are resolved by broadening the scope of what constitutes truth or a justifiable belief.
in essence, resolution occurs when we recognize the necessity of altering or abandoning a previously convincing boundary thesis.
how could someone challenge this proposal?
just like any philosophical topic, the concepts involved are intricate and offer various paths for exploration.
however, due to limitations in space, i will focus on three primary critiques.
although the issue of successor problems may arise, it should not be seen as a valid argument against holding a reasonable sense of optimism.
it is important to understand that progress in philosophy does not mean that no new problems can emerge.
this belief is unreasonable and would suggest that progress is unattainable in any field if followed consistently.
if the problem at hand remains identical between the original issue and its successor, it can challenge a sense of reasonable optimism.
however, in numerous instances, the successor problem differs from its predecessor.
for instance, the current problem regarding materialism and consciousness is separate from descartes' query.
descartes focused on equating matter with extension, whereas today's philosophers do not center their discussions around that concept.
however, despite the common objection to negativity in addressing boundary problems, there are two clear rebuttals to this view, particularly in the context of the argument being discussed.
firstly, the objection fails to recognize the nature of boundary problems, which often involve conflicting elements that necessitate trade-offs for resolution.
these dilemmas inherently demand relinquishing certain aspects.
hence, deeming the act of rejecting elements as merely negative overlooks the intricacies of these issues.
this is a fundamental aspect of addressing any paradoxical situation.
when faced with a set of credible premises leading to an implausible outcome, it is evident that all premises and the negation of the conclusion cannot simultaneously hold true.
therefore, to untangle the paradox, it is essential to make negative assertions.
an insistence on avoiding negativity while attempting to resolve the issue effectively hinders any progress in tackling the problem.
i believe we should acknowledge that philosophers frequently seek theories or explanations for phenomena that interest them.
upon further consideration, it becomes apparent that philosophers have also achieved success in this regard.
while philosophers may not focus on causal explanations, they are keenly interested in constitutive explanations.
when pondering concepts like consciousness, morality, or knowledge, the aim is to gain insight into the underlying structure of these elements in the world.
have we advanced in addressing such philosophical queries?
with the perspective influenced by lewis's idea of explanation, the crucial consideration becomes whether the current information offered on these constitutive structures surpasses past insights.
however, if the question is posed in this manner, it is hard to argue against answering it positively.
the information presented in areas such as philosophy of mind regarding the essence of conscious states appears to align well with the criteria lewis outlines in his assessment of effective or ineffective explanations.
for instance, the concept that conscious states involve the awareness of properties, as opposed to merely the presence of properties, is a prevalent idea in modern attempts at elucidating consciousness.
this proposition is widely accepted and integrated into various philosophical approaches to the mind.
even those philosophers who oppose it usually do so on the grounds that it may not be applicable to all conscious states, rather than dismissing its relevance altogether.
thus, this perspective on mental states offers more insightful knowledge on the fundamental structures linked to consciousness compared to previous understandings.
it illustrates a step forward in tackling a non-boundary problem.
to the degree that it mirrors typical progress in the field, there is cause for cautious optimism.
this indicates the approach of the non-contingent relationship supported by vmp, mirroring socrates' stance against euthyphro.
according to vmp proponents, euthyphro's understanding of aesthetic value is as unclear as his grasp on piety.
objects like exceptional artworks, graceful movements, and grand castles that we admire for their aesthetics do not possess value solely because they provide pleasure.
instead, they warrant our enjoyment because of their inherent aesthetic value.
as aesthetically valuable entities, they deserve a positive emotional response, such as pleasure or fondness.
the paragraph introduces eight characteristics in a specific order, from general aspects of pleasure in general to more specific qualities of aesthetic pleasure.
it begins with shared characteristics of all pleasures and progressively focuses on the unique qualities of aesthetic pleasure.
legal normativity is a complex concept within positivistic legal thinking, which is the prevailing perspective in legal philosophy in the 20th century and beyond.
positivists believe that law is essentially a human construct, created by individuals and institutions.
this raises the challenging question of how factual, social, behavioral, and psychological elements can give rise to normative aspects in law.
in other words, how can objective facts result in the creation of norms, and what kind of norms are these?
the multiple projects response argues that legal actors can sometimes be mistaken in their interpretation of their own actions.
it suggests that this may not be a significant issue, drawing parallels to the idea that scientists can also misunderstand their own work in the field of science.
the text questions why legal practitioners should be expected to have a deep understanding of the sociological and anthropological aspects of their profession.
if this skeptical viewpoint holds true, then there may not be a need to be concerned about the potential errors attributed in the multiple projects response.
in the movie reflections from 2008, timothy hutton portrays tom brindle, an europol agent who goes to barcelona in search of a serial killer known as pygmalion.
marco has agreed to collaborate as it is believed that, despite being apart, he might have similar traits, interests, and so on as his twin.
this could be beneficial in locating his twin.
an intriguing concept falls short in a movie that is somewhat dull and sluggish, despite timothy hutton delivering impressive acting.
hutton shines brightly in the film, suggesting potential for a promising career trajectory akin to sean penn's success.
this is a story in the style of "columbo," where the killer is revealed early on, and the focus is on the detective's pursuit and capture of the criminal.
personally, i prefer the "miss marple" murder mystery format, where the identity of the killer is a mystery that engages the audience more deeply in the story.
a problem in the movie is the abundance of secondary characters, which detracts from the main story and its emotional core.
for instance, a crucial moment for timothy hutton's character, tom, facing the death of his beloved, fails to have the intended impact.
this is due to an excessive number of unnecessary scenes and characters that prevent a deeper connection to tom's emotions and story development.
however, the other cast members deliver solid performances in their respective roles.
director bryan goeres maintains a moderate pace throughout the film.
it is suggested that he could have added more suspense and tension by varying the pace.
without hutton's performance and the anticipation of a surprising ending, the viewer might have lost interest.
when the plot twist finally arrived, it turned out to be disappointingly predictable.
the reader felt disappointed not only by the lack of surprise in the twist itself, but also by the fact that the story leading up to it could have been more effectively developed to build up to the twist.
if you enjoy films featuring timothy hutton or reminiscent of "columbo", you might find this movie appealing, but it may not exceed your expectations.
on the other hand, if those aren't your preferred genres, it's best to avoid it.
although the storyline mainly centers on the investigation, the manner in which the writers have tom making connections is frequently unrealistic, particularly in the film's later stages leading to the finale.
some parts of the movie seemed hastily done, as if they were trying to cram too much into the ending without proper development beforehand.
the narrative follows a skilled inspector from interpol as they track down a serial murderer who is at large in the northwestern region of the mediterranean.
due to ambition overshadowing skill, several aspects of the film are poorly done.
a major drawback is the decision to cast timothy hutton, who appears disinterested and somewhat unfriendly, unrelated to his character portrayal.
the other roles are well-suited for the cast, but the movie could benefit from having more consistent performances in some of the minor roles, especially among hutton's coworkers.
the primary issue faced by this well-made film was the audience itself.
it consisted of older women who would loudly shriek and giggle obnoxiously throughout a majority of the film, accompanied by their spouses who would chuckle in response.
it seemed as if they had never found anything as humorous as brando's character anxiously fixing his hair when expecting a visit from a young soldier.
mildred loving is portrayed in a unique and beautiful manner by ruth negga in the film loving, showing her as a modern hero in her journey to assert her identity and as a symbol of liberation for all americans.
the character's development in the movie, from a quiet presence in society to a heroic figure for her family and community, is praised.
negga's portrayal is notable for its subtle approach that enhances the character's complexity and makes her more appealing and engaging.
the narrative can be seen as both subtle and deeply meaningful.
the story includes specific and ordinary details that are sometimes presented in a slow and methodical manner.
the film initially grabs your attention but then proceeds at a slower pace, conveying a sense of quiet intimacy in the couple's private life.
the portrayal of characters, such as the mother-in-law and rich's best friend, is creative and engaging, showcasing the actors' talents.
the depiction of race relations is innovative and compelling, with a focus on the bonds between individuals rather than exploiting stereotypes.
last but not least, i focused on the main essence of the review: the theme.
i aimed to elevate the complexity of my assertions by providing supporting evidence.
i made a conscious effort to clarify to my intended audience the significance of the movie and the potential insights they could gain from it.
i delved further into exploring the various emotions the film aimed to evoke in its audience, and i am pleased with the revisions i made.
one of the most highly acclaimed films on the topic of education, most likely to succeed, has been gaining popularity in smaller theaters and various locations across the country.
the documentary compellingly argues for the need to transform the traditional education system and spotlights the innovative approach of high tech high in san diego, particularly its project-based learning program.
venture capitalist ted dintersmith serves as the executive producer, with greg whiteley taking on the roles of producer, writer, and director to create a engaging and impactful narrative that resonates emotionally and intellectually.
in addition, dintersmith and tony wagner authored a book with the same title that delves further into the subject matter.
alternating between these instances are brief, impactful interviews with houlbolt and queere, filmed in vivid contrasting colors; a red setting for the clown to coincide with his makeup, and blue for freckles.
as concise as they are candid, these interviews are startling in their sincerity as an unseen interviewer guides each individual to discuss topics like fear, death, love, and hope.
through this dual approach, sullivan constructs a detached yet potent world where the subtle complexities of familial ties can abruptly fracture, erupting in aggression.
this highlights a key conflict in the book - whether to prioritize the present moment or to have some sort of long-term plan for life.
the author believes that a mix of both approaches is necessary, as an extreme focus on either can be unproductive.
moreover, while constantly dwelling on death can be unsettling, ignoring it completely can lead to making decisions that are later regretted.
discussing the explained ideas shows an understanding and analysis that goes deeper than simply restating the author's points.
while the book provides important insights on immigration and birth control in western countries, reflecting on these topics presents various perspectives and offers a distinct viewpoint.
the writer's extreme views suggest they may be among the most racist individuals encountered.
their opinions appear to advocate for a scenario where there are fewer black individuals compared to white individuals in the future.
this implies a belief that other races are inferior and should not outnumber white people.
the author does not take into account the holocaust or concerns of the jewish people when addressing his subjects.
it could be said that he is conscious of the significant challenges facing western countries, but chooses to focus on lesser issues by claiming to predict a grim future.
basically, we need to reflect on the lessons we gained from a particular book.
i have selected animal farm, and here is my reflection, which is still a work in progress.
individuals must shift their perspectives on the presence of advantages and authority.
it is essential for them to engage in open conversations about these topics without being hindered by feelings of shame or blame.
one recommendation is for people to assess the current state of society, pinpoint existing issues, brainstorm appropriate remedies, and work together to put these solutions into action.
development on the game started in 2010, building upon the progress made on valkyria chronicles ii.
while maintaining the familiar elements of the series, the game received various refinements to make it more accessible to new players.
key members of the development team, including character designer raita honjou and composer hitoshi sakimoto, as well as director takeshi ozawa from the previous game, were involved in the project.
the script was managed by a team of writers, and the opening theme was performed by may'n.
the soldiers are permitted to move in any direction with their personal and public belongings, except for weapons used in war.
the soldiers were permitted to depart as troops following orders, rather than as defeated and surrendering soldiers.
on the morning of february 8, 1861, rector and totten reached an agreement to transfer control of the arsenal to state officials.
later that day, governor rector led the citizen militia to the arsenal, as all federal troops had departed except for totten, who stayed back to hear the governor's speech and personally hand over the arsenal.
in 1860, the little rock arsenal was designated as an "arsenal of deposit," which meant it served primarily as a storage facility for weapons destined for the state militia during emergencies.
as a result, the arsenal didn't have significant activities such as producing or repairing weapons, or making cartridges when it came under state control.
the arkansas military board had to establish these operations from the beginning.
in 1997, the museum of science and natural history combined with the little rock children's museum to create the arkansas museum of discovery, which then moved to a historic building in the little rock river market district.
additionally, the macarthur museum of arkansas military history was established on may 19, 2001 in the tower building.
this museum aims to educate the public about arkansas' military history, safeguard the tower building, pay tribute to american military personnel, and recognize douglas macarthur's origins.
during the late 1920s, barker started to question if she was sufficiently contributing to the church and thought about dedicating herself entirely to sacred projects.
encouraged by her loved ones, she chose to balance both secular and sacred endeavors.
barker kept attending evening classes at the croydon art school from the 1920s to the 1940s and later became a teacher there.
she went on sketching trips to various locations in sussex, cornwall, and the southern coast with her family and friends.
additionally, she visited artist margaret tarrant in gomshall, surrey, and also stayed with family in ugglebarnby, near whitby, north yorkshire.
the advancement of women's football in africa encounters various obstacles such as restricted educational opportunities, poverty among women, gender disparities, and violations of women's rights.
financial support primarily originates from fifa rather than national football associations, further complicating the growth of the sport.
additionally, retaining players poses a challenge as many female footballers leave africa for better prospects in europe or the united states.
the plain maskray typically forages near the surface of the seabed for food instead of burrowing.
it mainly feeds on caridean shrimp and polychaete worms, but it also consumes small bony fishes, penaeid prawns, and amphipods on occasion.
larger maskrays have a more diverse diet, including a higher proportion of polychaete worms.
additionally, these rays can be parasitized by the tapeworm acanthobothrium jonesi.
the tower was made up of two levels and a mezzanine.
the first floor housed the renowned sundial room, previously an open loggia that was enclosed by pope urban viii.
the room was then adorned with extensive frescoes painted by simon lagi, and flemish artists paul and matthijs bril between 1580 and 1582.
in the present day, the tower features paintings by cristoforo roncalli and matteino da siena.
the music video opens with an empty street, then shows various marginalized individuals going about their daily lives.
there are scenes of people playing dominoes, a gang teasing an elderly man, and an overweight woman walking down the street.
mariah carey is also seen observing these activities.
as the chorus kicks in, everyone in the street begins dancing and helping each other, with a gospel choir joining in.
the street becomes filled with people of different ages and backgrounds celebrating and harmonizing.
the video captures a message of unity and compassion, with a neon sign in the background reading "jesus saves." bulloch visited with stephen mallory, the secretary of the navy, in richmond to discuss a plan involving loading fingal with cotton to be sold on behalf of the navy department for acquiring more ships and equipment in europe.
following mallory's approval, bulloch procured a cargo and coal in savannah and made an unsuccessful attempt to evade the blockade on 23 december.
however, the union's control of the channels from savannah made escape impossible.
by late january 1862, bulloch informed mallory of the futile situation and was instructed to hand over the ship to another officer and find an alternative route back to europe.

after his mother loretta passed away from skin cancer during his freshman year, cullen considered going back home to ontario, but his father encouraged him to stay and pursue both his education and hockey career.
turning to the sport as a way to deal with the grief, he played every game in her honor and believed that drawing strength from his mother's struggle helped improve his skills on the ice.
while receiving treatment one day, cullen suffered a cardiac arrest while being wheeled down a hospital hallway by his wife.
doctors had to use a defibrillator to bring him back to life.
following a bone marrow transplant that weakened his immune system, he had to limit his human contact.
in april 1998, a check-up confirmed that the cancer had disappeared, prompting cullen to start preparing for a return to his previous activities.

he then discovered his family's disinterest in returning to their home city of cleveland.
consequently, cullen retired on november 28, 1998, and took up a coaching role with the lightning.
the nhl honored his resilience by awarding him the bill masterton memorial trophy in 1999.
additionally, the ihl renamed its comeback player of the year award to the john cullen award in tribute to his attempted comeback.
cullen's struggle with cancer motivated timm harmon from the moffitt cancer center to collaborate with the lightning to increase awareness and funds for cancer research.
in the winter of 1998, the nhl also got involved by launching the hockey fights cancer program to raise money for research.
cullen has actively supported and promoted this initiative.
ancient egyptian deities refer to the gods and goddesses honored in ancient egypt, whose worship was central to the ancient egyptian religion that originated in ancient times.
these deities represented natural elements and were revered through offerings and ceremonies to maintain harmony and order in accordance with maat, or divine principles.
following the establishment of the egyptian state circa 3100 bc, the responsibility of overseeing these rituals fell to the pharaoh, who asserted divine authority as the gods' intermediary and oversaw the temples where these practices took place.
gods were believed to be universally present and capable of impacting both natural occurrences and human destinies.
individuals engaged with them at both formal temples and informal shrines, seeking their guidance for personal matters and also for broader state ceremonies.
egyptians commonly prayed to their gods for assistance, performed rituals to impel their intervention, and sought their counsel.
the interaction between humans and deities played a key role in the fabric of egyptian civilization.
the origins of predynastic egypt can be traced back to autonomous villages.
some scholars believe that the egyptian pantheon developed as different communities merged into larger states, leading to the spread and blending of worship of local deities associated with specific areas.
conversely, others contend that the main predynastic gods were widespread throughout the nation, transcending political boundaries, similar to how various aspects of egyptian culture were uniformly present throughout the country.
the last stage in the development of egyptian religion occurred with the unification of egypt.
rulers from upper egypt became pharaohs of the entire country, establishing themselves and their officials as the only ones allowed to communicate with the gods.
as a result, kingship became the central theme of the religion.
a great deal of what is known about egyptian beliefs about the gods comes from religious writings created by the country's scribes and priests, who were the privileged class in society.
the majority of the population at the time were unable to read or write.
the extent to which the common people understood the complex ideas developed by the elite remains uncertain.
it is possible that there were differences in how the general population and the priests perceived the divine, with the commoners potentially interpreting symbolic religious explanations as literal truths.
however, the limited information available suggests that popular religious beliefs align relatively closely with those upheld by the elite.
overall, there seems to be coherence in the portrayal of the gods and their characteristics between the two groups.
it was believed that divine conduct controlled all aspects of nature.
with the exception of a few gods who caused disorder, the actions of the gods upheld harmony and nurtured all living creatures by utilizing a force known as heka, which is often interpreted as "magic" in english.
heka was viewed as an essential force that the creator god utilized to shape the world and the deities.
the initial divine act involves the creation of the cosmos as depicted in various creation myths.
these myths highlight different gods who perform as creator deities.
for example, the ogdoad's eight gods, symbolizing chaos before creation, give birth to the sun god who establishes order in the newly shaped world.
ptah, representing thought and creativity, shapes all things by imagining and naming them.
atum generates all things as extensions of himself, while amun, according to his priesthood's beliefs, precedes and gives rise to the other creator gods.
these diverse accounts of creation were not viewed as conflicting but rather as providing various perspectives on the intricate process through which the structured universe and its numerous deities emerged from an initial state of chaos.
following creation, a series of gods govern as kings over the divine realm in most myths.
they combat chaos and contend among themselves before ultimately stepping back from the human world and placing historical kings of egypt in charge.
gods were associated with specific parts of the universe in ancient egyptian beliefs.
the universe was believed to consist of the earth, the sky, and the duat, with the surrounding dark formlessness representing the time before creation.
while most gods were thought to reside in the sky, those with specific roles were associated with different parts of the universe.
mythological events, occurring before the gods retreated from the human realm, took place on earth, with occasional interactions between earth-bound deities and sky deities.
the duat, on the other hand, was considered a distant and isolated realm where communication between its resident gods and those in the living world was challenging.
additionally, the space beyond the cosmos was believed to be inhabited by deities, some of which were regarded as hostile while others were supportive of the ordered world of gods.
in egyptian belief, names are seen as reflective of the true nature of the entities they represent.
thus, the names of deities often correlate with their characteristics or origins.
for instance, the name sekhmet, associated with a powerful goddess, means "powerful one", while amun's name, linked to a god of mystery, signifies "hidden one".
similarly, nekhbet's name relates to her city of worshippers, nekheb.
however, some names lack clear meanings despite their association with specific roles.
for example, the names of sky goddess nut and earth god geb do not directly translate to "sky" or "earth" in egyptian.
the egyptians came up with incorrect explanations for divine names, attributing additional meanings to them.
for instance, in the coffin texts, the name of the god sokar was interpreted as "cleaning of the mouth" to associate it with his role in a specific ritual.
in the pyramid texts, it is suggested that the name sokar derived from words spoken by osiris, aligning sokar with the key funerary deity.
the gods were thought to have various names, including secret ones that revealed their true essence more deeply.
knowing a deity's true name gave one control over it.
this significance of names is illustrated in a tale where isis poisons ra and demands his secret name as payment for the antidote.
once she learns the name, she shares it with her son horus, granting them increased knowledge and authority.
the egyptian gods were linked in intricate and ever-changing relationships.
these connections with other deities played a crucial role in shaping each god's identity.
for instance, isis, known as a healer and the guardian of horus, was also revered as the special deity of kings.
these divine relationships served as the foundation for the myths that were developed.
many gods in egyptian mythology are connected through familial relationships, often depicted as male and female pairs to emphasize the importance of procreation.
triads of deities, consisting of a father, mother, and child, symbolize the creation of new life and the passing of power from one generation to the next.
this pattern, exemplified by deities like osiris, isis, and horus, became widespread over time, with various divine families such as ptah, sekhmet, and nefertum at memphis, and amun, mut, and khonsu at thebes.
these genealogical relationships are fluid in egyptian belief, with figures like hathor embodying different roles in different contexts.
nine, arising from the multiplication of three by three, symbolized a large collection for the egyptians.
they referred to various significant groups as " enneads ", groups of nine, irrespective of the actual number of members.
the most renowned ennead was the ennead of heliopolis, a divine family lineage originating from the god atum, encompassing numerous essential gods.
this terminology was commonly broadened to encompass all of egypt's deities.
this divine gathering had a somewhat unclear and changeable hierarchy, where gods with significant influence or age in mythology were considered to have higher positions.
at the top of this hierarchy was the king of the gods, typically associated with the creator deity.
throughout different eras in egyptian history, various gods held this esteemed position.
for example, horus was most significant in the early dynastic period, ra in the old kingdom, amun in the new kingdom, and isis in the later ptolemaic and roman periods.
when new gods rose to prominence, they often inherited characteristics from their predecessors.
isis, for instance, incorporated attributes from several goddesses as she gained importance, and when amun took over as the leader of the pantheon, he fused with ra to become a solar deity.
in 1971, erik hornung published a study challenging the notion that egyptian religion was monotheistic or pantheistic.
he argues that many deities, including lesser-known ones, were frequently depicted as superior to all others.
hornung suggests that the term "god" in ancient texts was generic and could refer to any deity chosen by the reader to worship.
he highlights that while the characteristics and representations of gods varied, they were never portrayed as completely interchangeable in a monotheistic or pantheistic manner.
instead, he proposes that henotheism, the worship of one god without denying the existence of others, better describes egyptian religious practices.
according to hornung, the gods in egyptian mythology were united only in myth and before creation, and emerged as a multitude from a uniform nonexistence thereafter.
egyptian texts provide detailed descriptions of the gods' bodies, attributing qualities such as flesh made of gold, bones of silver, and hair of lapis lazuli.
the gods are said to emit a fragrance resembling incense, and some texts specify details like height and eye color.
however, these features are not fixed, as gods are known to alter their appearances.
egyptian writings often refer to the deities' true forms as "mysterious," and visual depictions of the gods symbolize specific traits rather than being literal representations.
for example, the depiction of anubis as a dog or jackal in egyptian art serves to counter the threat of scavengers to buried mummies and to symbolize resurrection through his black coloring.
even though the egyptians thought their gods were among them, direct interactions between humans and the divine realm were generally restricted to specific situations.
while literature may depict gods appearing to humans physically, in reality, communication between egyptians and the gods was often through indirect channels.
to safeguard the sanctity of the temple sanctuaries and protect them from outside impurities, the egyptians encased them and limited access primarily to kings and high priests.
except during festive processions when the cult statues were briefly brought out in portable shrines, common people were prohibited from direct interaction.
however, individuals had alternative ways to engage with the divine, as public temple areas included designated areas for prayer, such as doorways or stand-alone chapels nearby.
communities constructed and oversaw their own chapels, and some households had personal shrines.
despite the perceived distance between humans and the gods, the egyptians were continually surrounded by various means to connect and communicate with their deities.
the egyptian gods interacted with both human lives and the natural order.
while their influence was primarily felt in egypt, foreigners were seen as outside this divine order.
however, in the new kingdom period when egypt controlled other nations, foreigners were believed to be under the rule of the sun god just like egyptians.
humans had the choice to disregard divine guidance and the principles of maat, but in doing so, they risked facing divine retribution.
this punishment was delivered by deities wielding their ba, a power that was believed to carry out the will of the gods in the human realm.
the ancients attributed natural calamities and diseases to the wrath of the deities' bas.
on the other hand, the gods were also thought to be capable of healing the virtuous and prolonging their lives.
over time, specific deities embodying these concepts emerged, such as shed, who symbolized protection from harm during the new kingdom, and petbe, an apotropaic deity from later periods in egyptian history who was thought to mete out justice for wrongdoing.
egyptian texts offer varied perspectives on whether the gods bear responsibility for human suffering.
some texts attribute misfortune to the cosmic disorder, isfet, contrasting it with maat, absolving the gods of blame for evil occurrences.
certain deities linked with isfet, like set, are sometimes implicated for worldly chaos without incriminating other gods.
conversely, some texts do place blame on the gods for causing human suffering, while others present justifications defending the gods.
in the middle kingdom, narratives began linking evil in the world to a myth in which the creator god combats a human revolt against his authority and then distances himself from the earth due to human disobedience, leading to the existence of suffering.
during the new kingdom, texts show less questioning of the gods' just nature compared to the earlier middle kingdom writings.
the focus shifts to emphasizing personal relationships with deities and their capacity to intervene in human affairs.
in this period, individuals placed trust in specific gods for personal protection, diminishing the significance of upholding maat ideals in favor of seeking favor from the gods for a prosperous life.
even the pharaohs were perceived as reliant on divine assistance, and post-new kingdom governance increasingly heeded oracles conveying divine will.
official religious rituals in egypt were concerned with upholding maat for the greater good of society, while the common people's religious practices were more personal in nature, focused on seeking divine assistance for their individual challenges.
as the roman economy declined in the third century ad, temples and cults in egypt diminished.
by the fourth century, christians began to suppress the worship of egyptian deities, leading to the extinction of formal cults, such as at philae in the fifth or sixth century.
beliefs surrounding the gods faded away over time, though some persisted in magical texts until the seventh and eighth centuries.
practices like processions and oracles from the worship of the deities were modified to align with christian beliefs and were integrated into the coptic church.
the extent to which modern coptic practices are directly descended from those of ancient egyptian religion is a topic of debate among scholars due to the significant changes in egyptian culture over time.
however, many festivals and traditions observed by present-day egyptians, regardless of their religious affiliation, bear similarities to the worship practices of their ancestors.
south of heaven is the fourth album by the american thrash metal group slayer.
it was released on july 5, 1988, marking the band's second partnership with producer rick rubin.
rubin's work on their previous album, reign in blood, was pivotal in shaping slayer's evolving sound.
south of heaven marked slayer's second album to make it onto the billboard 200 chart.
this album was the final one to be put out by def jam recordings before becoming an american recordings release when rick rubin split from russell simmons.
despite columbia records' refusal to distribute the album, it was picked up by geffen records through warner bros.
south of heaven reached number 57 on the charts and received a gold certification in 1992 from the recording industry association of america.
the main song and track called "mandatory suicide" by slayer have been covered in different ways, especially on tribute albums.
toni ferguson created string quartet versions of both songs on an album titled the string quartet tribute to slayer: the evil you dread.
the cover version of the main track was noted for its ominous chord changes, as described by music critic johnny loftus from allmusic.
private flying can be categorized into recreational purposes and personal transport, with individuals either owning aircraft themselves, sharing ownership collectively, or renting from flying clubs.
a survey conducted among pilots in 2001-2002 revealed that common recreational flight activities included local trips near the base aerodrome, visits to other aerodromes, and day outings.
additionally, around half of the flights returned to the departure aerodrome, with only a small percentage involving overnight stays away from home.
in 2007, there were 27 deadly incidents involving general aviation aircraft which led to the deaths of 48 people.
this stands in contrast to the previous year, where 16 accidents resulted in 19 fatalities.
while the figures for 2007 were above the norm, they were not considered unusually high.
airspace is used by various users, including commercial, military, and general aviation.
it is categorized into controlled and uncontrolled airspace, where controlled airspace requires aircraft to be under the guidance of air traffic controllers, while uncontrolled airspace allows for autonomous operation.
general aviation flights mostly operate outside of controlled airspace, with some exceptions permitting entry under specific circumstances.
in recent years, regional airports like edinburgh airport have seen a significant rise in commercial air transport (cat) operations, creating challenges for general aviation (ga).
while there may not be intentional discrimination, the practices have inadvertently deterred or excluded ga.
charges for ga aircraft have increased, including the introduction of handling fees at some airports.
there are restrictions on ga parking and activities at certain airports, leading to a decline in light ga aircraft presence at major international airports such as heathrow, stansted, gatwick, and manchester.
the planning system plays a crucial role in the functionality of general aviation (ga) aerodromes.
as many cities lack direct air transport services and access to commercial airports for ga is increasingly challenging and costly, having a well-supported network of aerodromes is seen as a significant national concern.
however, there is no unified national planning policy for ga aerodromes, leading to decisions being made at a local level without considering broader national implications.
aircraft noise, as the main concern in many planning decisions related to ga land use, is the subject in which planning restrictions are often based.
local planning authorities, not always familiar with ga, tend to either reject planning requests or approve them with strict conditions.
this lack of clear planning guidelines can hinder the growth and safety of ga operations, as seen in examples like little gransden airfield, which must adhere to limitations on movements, potentially impeding further development.
the idea of a gold dollar was suggested multiple times in the 1830s and 1840s but was not immediately approved.
however, following the california gold rush, which significantly increased the availability of gold, congress was motivated to take action and authorized the creation of a gold dollar in 1849.
initially, the gold dollar quickly gained popularity in commerce as silver coins were being hoarded or exported.
eventually, when congress mandated lighter silver coins in 1853, silver coins started circulating once again, leading to the gold dollar becoming less common in transactions.
furthermore, due to the economic turmoil brought about by the american civil war, federal coins disappeared from circulation, further diminishing the use of the gold dollar in commerce.
the carving was extremely detailed and demanded intense and continuous effort over a period of weeks.
i created the initial tools and molds for producing the final tools twice to ensure they fit perfectly with the minting equipment.
i wanted to complete the project on my own to prove skeptics wrong about my skills.
i think the outcome was successful.
the first design of the gold dollar, known as type 1, shows an image of liberty facing left wearing a crown or tiara with her name on it.
her hair is tied up in a bun, and she is encircled by 13 stars symbolizing the original states.
on the back side, there is a wreath with the date and value, along with the nation's name placed at the edge.
the process has been employed in several important complete syntheses such as the danishefsky taxol synthesis, which creates the anticancer drug taxol, and the kuehne strychnine synthesis that generates the pesticide strychnine.
besides the reactions documented by johnson, corey, and chaykovsky, other homologation reactions utilizing sulfur ylides have been employed and categorized collectively under the same label.
aggarwal has created a new technique that uses the sulfide mentioned earlier along with a unique alkylation process that involves a rhodium carbenoid produced on-site.
however, this method also has restrictions as it is only effective for a specific range of substrates and cannot be used with electrophiles containing basic substituents because the carbenoid is used up in competition with them.
the agreement conspicuously did not address any of the social changes that madero had loosely pledged in the past, nor did it make any alterations to the existing porfirian state.
furthermore, madero advocated settling land disputes exclusively through the courts with the same old judges in place, a decision that sparked occasional violence, especially in rural regions.
at approximately the same period, there was widespread dissatisfaction among farmers in morelos which developed into a significant uprising led by the brothers emiliano and eufemio zapata.
the goal was to quickly disband the revolutionary groups and establish the federal forces as the sole military presence in mexico.
this decision aimed to placate the army, which had objected to reaching a compromise with madero.
many reviewers praised the feast of the goat, appreciating its portrayal of the connection between sex and authority, as well as the vivid descriptions of violent scenes.
trujillo held the title of dictator from 1930 to 1938, and again from 1942 to 1952, but he exerted control over the country during the whole time.
despite his regime being largely nationalist, daniel chirot notes that trujillo did not follow a specific ideology, and his economic and social policies were generally considered progressive.
the novel's story is separated into three main parts.
one part follows urania cabral, a fictional character from the dominican republic, while another delves into the group of conspirators planning to assassinate trujillo.
the third part centers around trujillo himself.
the narrative shifts between these three plotlines and moves back and forth between 1961 and 1996, often including flashbacks to earlier times in trujillo's rule.
as the novel reaches its conclusion, the three narratives start to converge more frequently.
the tone of these final chapters becomes notably bleak, focusing on the brutal torture and demise of the assassins by the sim, the unsuccessful coup, urania's traumatic experience, and the compromises made to appease trujillo's most ruthless followers, who carry out their savage retribution on the plotters before fleeing the country.
the story closes with urania gearing up to go back home, committed this time to staying connected with her family on the island.
the main themes of the feast of the goat involve political corruption, masculinity, memory, and the interplay between writing and power.
olga lorenzo, who reviewed the book for the melbourne age, proposes that vargas llosa's main objective is to expose the illogical influences of latin tradition that lead to authoritarian rule.
memory plays a significant role in the parts of the novel that focus on the assassins, as each of them recalls the events that led to their participation in the assassination of trujillo.
these events include the galindez kidnapping and murder in 1956, the murder of the mirabal sisters in 1960, and the split with the catholic church in 1961.
vargas llosa uses these historical incidents to show how the assassins are linked to specific moments that reveal the brutality of trujillo's regime.
moreover, trujillo himself is depicted reflecting on his own past, particularly his training under the us marines.
primarily, mario vargas llosa employs the character urania within the narrative to aid in the novel's exploration of remembering the regime.
urania's story both opens and concludes the novel, providing a framework for examining the past and its impact on the present.
furthermore, her expertise in studying the history of the trujillo regime allows her to grapple with the collective memory of the regime for the nation.
this aligns with the novel's goal of ensuring that future generations remember the brutalities of the dictatorship and the perils of unchecked authority.
ruiz suggests that writing has the ability to alter reality by immersing readers in the past and helping them grasp the true essence of myths and inaccuracies found in historical accounts.
understanding the past is deemed essential for comprehending the present from a postmodern perspective.
ruiz asserts that "the feast of the goat" serves as a postmodern narrative that empowers the recreation of history.
some reviewers have noted that the feast of the goat stands out for its realist style compared to the allegorical approach often seen in dictator novels.
the novel has generally been well-received, with many reviewers appreciating its compelling storytelling even if it may take some liberties with historical accuracy.

the caves' rock architecture, carved from solid basalt rock, is believed to have been constructed between the 5th and 8th centuries.
there is ongoing debate about the identity of the individuals who originally built the caves.
while the caves were once adorned with paint, only faint remnants of the original artwork can be seen today.
even though the primary cave was renovated in the 1970s, several other caves, including three with significant sculptures, remain in poor condition.
these caves were recognized as a unesco world heritage site in 1987 due to their cultural significance and as they embody a remarkable example of human creativity and provide exceptional evidence of a culture that is either still existing or has vanished.
located on the eastern side of the island, there is a cluster of caves on stupa hill that hold buddhist relics.
the hill draws its name from the stupa monument it features.
one of the caves remains unfinished, while the second one houses a brick-built stupa.
the primary cave combines elements of chalukyan architecture, such as large sculptures of deities and guardians, and square pillars with unique capitals, with gupta artistic features like representations of mountains, clouds, and female hairstyles.
one tale about the depicted panels involves a quarrel between parvati and shiva.
ravana happened to come across mount kailash, and in frustration at the obstacle, he shook it.
this action startled parvati, causing her to seek comfort in shiva's embrace.
shiva, angered by ravana's behavior, subdued him until ravana praised shiva and asked for forgiveness, becoming a devoted follower.
alternatively, another account suggests that shiva was pleased with ravana for calming parvati and granted him a blessing.
located on the eastern hill north of sitabai's cave is a hindu excavation structure with a veranda.
originally intended to have three cells, this construction was halted due to a defect in the rock.
on the east side of the hill lies a desolate pond surrounded by artificial boulders and buddhist cisterns.
at the tip of the northern spur of the main hill stands a mound reminiscent of a buddhist stupa.
townsend made significant changes in his life by leaving the music industry, cutting his iconic hair, and quitting drinking and smoking.
he struggled with writing music without the use of drugs and felt lost as a musician.
after trying to produce music without success, he eventually decided to pick up the guitar and focus on creating music the natural way.
this marked a period of self-discovery where he learned how to be creative without relying on drugs.
the next album, titled addicted, was released in november 2009 and is described as a blend of commercial and heavy music.
it includes lead vocals from devin townsend and dutch singer anneke van giersbergen.
brian waddell, previously a member of the devin townsend band, joined the project to play bass.
in april 2016, devin is currently in the process of recording the seventh album for dtp, titled transcendence, at armoury studios in vancouver.
townsend, inspired by diverse influences, created two distinct musical projects: the intense strapping young lad and his more melodic solo work.
while strapping young lad embraced a range of aggressive metal genres, townsend's solo music fused various styles such as ambient, hard rock, and progressive rock.
he described his solo work as a complex blend of hard rock and metal with rich orchestration and atmospheric layers.
despite commercial success with strapping young lad, townsend's true artistic identity lies in his solo endeavors, which he prioritizes over his other project.
since the 1980s, there have been efforts to reconstruct the synagogue in its original spot, but progress has been slow due to political factors.
there are significant disagreements between the government and jewish groups regarding the level of involvement the organizations should have in decisions related to the rebuilding project, such as the design and style of the new structure.
construction started in 1866 and finished in the subsequent year.
the synagogue was consecrated on september 27, 1867, in a ceremony attended by city and regional authorities, prominent figures from zagreb, and many citizens.
as the first significant public building in zagreb's lower town, its design and size were highly admired and commended.
the addition of an organ to the religious services in the new synagogue led to a split among the congregation.
a small group of orthodox jews, who opposed the use of the organ, decided to hold their own services in rented rooms.
in the earthquake of 1880, the synagogue sustained slight damage and was subsequently restored in the following year.
there were additional disputes regarding the style and nature of the proposed new building.
although it would have been possible to create an exact replica, this option was not given much thought.
it was broadly agreed that the new building should serve both cultural and commercial purposes.
the jewish community of zagreb favored a contemporary design inspired by the original synagogue, while bet israel pushed for reproducing just the facade of the former building, considering it highly symbolic.
the stance of architects, city planners, and art historians reflected similar divisions in opinions.
political activists have raised concerns about fits, arguing that they are used to deter legal protests.
journalists have also reported issues with fits preventing them from documenting protests and monitoring their activities.
a dedicated group called fitwatch was established in 2007 to counter fit operations and track their conduct.
two members were arrested at a 2008 event for obstructing fits.
another police unit, the video intelligence unit, similar to fits, is managed by greater manchester police.
the home office announced in june 2010 that it would review the application of fits in public order policing.
in june 2010, the home office revealed plans to reassess the application of fits in public order policing.
this decision came in response to findings that fits were gathering information beyond suspected criminal activities, such as documenting individuals giving speeches at protests.
three fitwatch members were found guilty for impeding fit officers while trying to take pictures at a no borders meeting in london in june 2008.
in july 2010, the inner london crown court overturned their convictions, as the judge suggested that the officers may have infringed upon the protesters' human rights.
the case originated in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania, where the judge initially rejected both trinsey's and the commonwealth's motions.
however, on june 10, 1991, the district court ruled the statute unconstitutional as it failed to allow for "popular participation" required by the fourteenth and seventeenth amendments by not incorporating primary elections.
after examining the legislative history of the seventeenth amendment and electoral processes, the court determined that pennsylvania's nomination process before special elections suggested a right to vote, which was compromised by the absence of primaries, leading to a strict scrutiny of the law.
despite the commonwealth's arguments, the court found that these reasons did not justify denying the right to vote, ultimately deeming the special elections statute unconstitutional.
jordan was sought after by many college basketball teams such as duke, north carolina, south carolina, syracuse, and virginia.
he ultimately decided to attend north carolina on a basketball scholarship in 1981 and studied cultural geography.
many people consider jordan to be the best basketball player in history.
in a survey conducted by espn in 1999, jordan was ranked as the top north american athlete of the 20th century, surpassing legends like babe ruth and muhammad ali.
additionally, he was named the basketball player of the 20th century by the associated press.
jordan's achievements include being on the front cover of sports illustrated 50 times, and being recognized as the greatest athlete of the past 50 years in sport's september 1996 issue.
jordan's personal airplane showcases a carolina blue stripe, the iconic " air jordan " logo on the tail, and details related to his career in the registration number.
during world war ii, the occupying forces of nazi germany and the soviet union suppressed polish culture, targeting scholars, artists, and cultural artifacts.
this resulted in widespread deaths and destruction that aimed to erase poland's cultural heritage.
niall ferguson, a british historian, noted that the mistreatment of poles was just one of the many similarities between the oppressive regimes of the nazis and soviets.
the invaders plundered and ruined a significant part of poland's cultural and historical treasures, in addition to targeting and killing leaders in the polish cultural community.
the majority of polish educational institutions were shut down, and the ones that stayed open had their educational programs drastically changed.
the german forces in poland were heavily involved in eradicating jewish culture, particularly through the destruction of wooden synagogues.
additionally, they prohibited the sale of jewish literature across the country.
educational and training programs focus heavily on the world war ii era and the occupation.
war-related events and figures are prevalent in various forms of media such as tv, radio, and print.
the impact of world war ii is also evident in literature, education, film, theater, and the arts.
politicians frequently reference this historical period.
this country stands out for frequently and ceremoniously acknowledging anniversaries associated with world war ii.
following germany's defeat and the armistice in november 1918, the royal navy held markgraf and the main warships of the high seas fleet in scapa flow.
these vessels were disarmed and operated with only a bare minimum crew while the allied nations finalized the treaty of versailles.
just before the treaty was officially signed on 21 june 1919, rear admiral ludwig von reuter, in charge of the interned fleet, gave the order to sink the ships to prevent the british from taking control of them.
unlike other ships that were scuttled, markgraf was never salvaged and remains on the seabed to this day.
after being commissioned on 1 october 1914, markgraf underwent sea trials until 12 december.
by 10 january 1915, the ship had become part of the iii battle squadron of the high seas fleet along with her three sister ships.
on 22 january 1915, the squadron was separated from the fleet to practice maneuvers, gunnery, and torpedo drills in the baltic sea.
the ships sailed back to the north sea on 11 february, missing the opportunity to support the i scouting group during the battle of dogger bank.
archaeologists have determined that the coldrum stones were constructed by pastoralist communities shortly after agriculture was introduced to britain from continental europe.
while part of a broader tradition of long barrow building in neolithic europe, these stones are considered a local variant of barrows found near the river medway, known as the medway megaliths.
the coldrum stones are in the best state of preservation among the medway megaliths and are situated close to other barrows like addington long barrow and chestnuts long barrow on the river's western side.
on the eastern side of the river, three other well-preserved long barrows, kit's coty house, the little kit's coty house, and the coffin stone, can be found.
the stones in the area can be classified into two main groups: one located to the west of the river medway and another on blue bell hill to the east, with a distance of around 8 to 10 km between them.
the cluster in the west includes coldrum long barrow, addington long barrow, and the chestnuts long barrow, while the eastern group comprises kit's coty house, little kit's coty house, the coffin stone, and other stones possibly from chambered tombs.
it is unclear whether these structures were all built simultaneously or one after the other, and there is uncertainty regarding their intended purposes and whether they were used in a hierarchical manner.
all the medway long barrows were built following a similar blueprint, with each one oriented in an east-west direction.
they featured a stone chamber located at the eastern part of the mound, most likely with a stone facade beside the entrance.
these chambers were made of sarsen, which is a tough and long-lasting type of stone found in abundance in kent, created from hardened sand during the eocene period.
during the early neolithic era, builders would have sourced these stones locally and then transported them to the monuments' locations for construction.
there might have been a front structure in front of the tomb, similar to those seen at other tombs in britain like west kennet long barrow and wayland's smithy.
there could have also been a stone at the entrance, as seen at kit's coty house and lower kit's coty house.
some of the large fallen stones on the eastern end of the site might have been components of this front structure.
keith suggested that the skulls he studied shared common characteristics, theorizing that they could belong to either one large family or multiple families with shared ancestry.
similarly, other researchers observed comparable features in skulls from different long barrows in britain, but smith and brickley cautioned that this did not necessarily indicate a family connection.
they suggested that the findings could also be attributed to a small, closely related population that lived in scattered groups.
the presence of occupational remains on top of the bones was not exclusive to this site but was a typical feature in chambered tombs from southern england.
by examining a similar case found at kit's coty house, ashbee believed that the coldrum chamber would have been divided into sections by internal slabs, which acted similarly to the side chambers found in west kennet and wayland's smithy.
the megalithic tombs dating back to the early neolithic period have been neglected and impacted by agriculture.
even though the coldrum stones are considered one of the least damaged long barrows in kent, they too have experienced significant deterioration over the past six thousand years.
one notable issue is the collapse of the eastern side, with the stones that supported it now lying at the base of the slope.
it is suggested that some of the sarsens at the bottom of the slope may not have been part of the original structure but were added later, potentially by farmers who found them in nearby fields.
the song received prestigious awards in 1987, winning best single at the brit awards and best international hit at the ivor novello awards.
two decades later in 2005, it was recognized as the song of the decade (1985-1994) by the british academy of composers and songwriters.
furthermore, in 2015, the british public ranked it as the nation's 12th favorite 1980s number one in a poll conducted by itv.
in 1983, during a trip to new york to interview sting for smash hits, neil tennant connected with producer bobby orlando.
impressed by some demo recordings, orlando proposed to work as a producer for tennant and his duo partner.
"west end girls" is a synthpop track with hip hop music influences.
the socially aware tone and driving bassline of the song were inspired by grandmaster flash's protest rap tune "the message".
lowe and hague developed a dynamic and captivating rhythm for the music, enhancing the song from its previous simple beats and limited keyboard parts.
"west end girls" has been praised by music critics.
stephen thomas erlewine described the song as "hypnotic" and highlighted its status as a classic dance and pop single.
rob hoerburger noted its catchiness and compelling bass line in a review for the group's second album, but was critical of some elements in the lyrics.
michael hubbard complimented "west end girls" as a song that contributes positively to the overall collection of music in a review of a live album, suggesting that it helps solidify the duo's status as important musical figures.
in a review by nitsuh abebe from pitchfork media on the compilation album popart: pet shop boys - the hits, it was noted that in the song, tennant is presented differently than a traditional singer.
rather than coming across as a star, he is likened to a mysterious figure in a raincoat, softly delivering the verses like a stranger walking beside you, quietly pointing out interesting details.
in 1993, the band east 17 recorded a version of "west end girls" for their album walthamstow, but it did not achieve widespread success on the charts.
greg kurstin produced all the tracks, while jason halbert provided vocal production specifically for the song "every christmas." the concert dvd features performances that were recorded during the television special kelly clarkson's cautionary christmas music tale.
the pair of thieves successfully stop the gang sent by gabbar to terrorize the villagers.
then, during the holi festival, gabbar and his henchmen launch an attack on ramgarh.

he had concealed his disability by always covering his arms with a shawl.
researchers have identified various prevalent themes in the movie, including the celebration of violence, adherence to feudal values, clash between established social norms and insurgent groups, close relationships among males, and the film's representation as a reflection of national identity.
stansfield chose to stay in the conference by signing with exeter city after his contract expired on 12 june 2006.
he expressed on local radio that his primary goal was not about achieving promotion or scoring a specific number of goals, but rather to have a positive impact on the younger players at the club.
stansfield experienced ongoing stomach discomfort in the beginning of 2010, leading to his hospitalization for examinations towards the end of march.
by april 8, 2010, it was publicly disclosed by exeter city that he had received a colorectal cancer diagnosis.
in an interview with the local news program bbc spotlight, manager paul tisdale acknowledged the seriousness of the situation, noting that although the news was not optimistic, stansfield possessed the strength and determination to confront it.
fans of exeter still cherish the memory of stansfield.
at the beginning of the new season on 9 august 2014, during a match against portsmouth, supporters honored him by unfurling a large flag that resembled his team's shirt.
on 8 august 2015, exeter city and yeovil town arranged to hold a minute's applause in tribute to a player who had worn the numbers seven and nine during his time at each club.
this gesture was made during their meeting at st james park.

in 1969, saprang began his military journey as a rifle platoon leader in the 3rd infantry battalion, 4th regimental combat team.
throughout his time in the military, he states that he engaged in around 200 conflicts.
saprang was briefly moved to the ministry of defense in april 1997 before being promoted to commanding general of the 15th infantry division in october 1997.
he was later elevated to 3rd corps commander in 2003.
rumors circulated in 2004 that he might take over the command of the 4th army due to criticism of general pongsak ekbannasingh's handling of the south thailand insurgency, following multiple arson attacks.
however, pisarn wattanawongkhiri ultimately replaced pongsak in april 2004.
a week following the coup, saprang and anupong paochinda, both leaders of the coup, were appointed as assistant army commanders.
the previous army commander, general pornchai kranlert, who did not participate in the coup, was reassigned to a non-active role.
additionally, saprang was upgraded from the rank of lieutenant general to general.
saprang expressed concerns in an interview that allowing telecommunications companies to be privately owned could jeopardize national security.
the military government had previously revealed intentions to halt the initial public offering of tot and cat telecom and to merge the two state-run enterprises.
a week after saprang alluded to a restructuring of aot's senior leadership, chotisak asapaviriya, the president of aot, resigned due to health issues.
additionally, the directors of suvarnabhumi airport and aot commercial operations were removed from their positions.
police commissioner general seripisut temiyavej was then appointed as a director at aot.
saprang, as the chairman of aot, led an initiative to reopen don muang airport alongside suvarnabhumi airport, despite opposition from various parties, including the civil aviation department, airlines, and internal research conducted by airports of thailand.
there was a potential threat of 60 airlines ceasing flights to thailand if they were required to relocate back to don muang airport.
in addition to the monetary donation requested by the army, the aot board approved 200 million baht for the military and provided some of its explosives detectors to help in addressing the conflict in south thailand.
saprang and former prime minister chavalit yongchaiyudh engaged in a heated exchange over the 2006 bangkok new year's eve bombings after chavalit criticized saprang's competence.
saprang contended that evidence and intelligence indicated that the bombings were orchestrated by ousted politicians in collaboration with disloyal soldiers to undermine the government.
nonetheless, prime minister surayud chulanont contradicted saprang's claims shortly after.
in may 2007, saprang hinted that he had insights about the confiscation of a terrorism manual in bangkok by english authorities from a london flat.
he refrained from revealing more details and urged the public to draw their own conclusions.
shortly after, an explosion occurred near chitrlada palace.
saprang later explained that the discovery of the manual was actually made in the early 1990s.
this led deputy chief of the british mission in bangkok, andy pierce, to express his worry over saprang's statements, which he argued were unsubstantiated.
after showcasing his talents, ali was discovered by an italian man in cairo and was offered a contract to perform in music halls across europe and even for important figures.
he recalled being invited to showcase his skills at the winter palace in saint petersburg by tsar nicholas ii of russia around 1914.
impressed by his performance, the tsar honored him with a special decoration as a token of appreciation.
post world war i, ali took charge of his career, traveling worldwide and expanding his repertoire of tricks along the way.
ali's signature act involved ingesting a large amount of water and kerosene before performing as a "human flamethrower".
he would expel the kerosene as a long stream of fire over a metal prop, often a model house or castle with a small flame inside.
the kerosene, being lighter than water, allowed him to expel it first before shooting a stream of water up to six feet away to extinguish the fire.
the spectacle was accompanied by a drum roll or fire bells for dramatic effect.
reports of the engagement made their way back to france, but amidst the chaos of the revolution at that time, little attention was paid to events in india.
historian william james suggests that in more stable political circumstances, the incident would have had a greater impact, while edward pelham brenton posits that the french intentionally disregarded the news to avoid upsetting britain.
in britain, the admiralty approved of cornwallis' actions, implying that the french were using trade as a cover to aid mysore against britain.
the event did not alter the course of the war in india, which was mainly focused on the city of seringapatam.
by february 1792, as british forces sealed in on the city, tipu sultan initiated peace negotiations that eventually concluded the war with concessions made to the east india company and its allies.
the album was initially launched in japan on june 7, 2006, by universal music group, followed by a release in germany two days later.

the home kit consisted of red shirts with white sleeves, light blue shorts, and white socks, while the away kit featured light blue shirts with white sleeves, white shorts, and light blue socks.
benenden health remained as the shirt sponsors for the second year in a row.
statto provides information on where teams are placed in the league, while other details are obtained from individual sources.
the use of brackets around club names indicates that the player's contract with that club had ended before they joined york.
players who are named but have not played have been included in the team for the match but were not utilized during the game.
china has long been the top manufacturer of antimony and its derivatives, mainly sourced from the xikuangshan mine in hunan.
industrial techniques like roasting and reduction with carbon, as well as direct reduction of stibnite with iron, are commonly employed to produce antimony.
in his work natural history, the ancient roman scholar pliny the elder outlined various methods for preparing antimony sulfide for medicinal use.
additionally, pliny distinguished between two forms of antimony - "male" and "female." it is believed that the male form refers to the sulfide, while the female form, described as superior, heavier, and less prone to breaking, is thought to be natural metallic antimony.
pedanius dioscorides, a roman naturalist, indicated that antimony sulfide could be transformed into metallic antimony by roasting it with the help of a current of air.
in 1615, german chemist andreas libavius discovered the metal antimony by combining iron with a hot mixture of antimony sulfide, salt, and potassium tartrate.
this method resulted in antimony with a distinctive crystalline or starred appearance.
when challenges arose against the phlogiston theory, scientists acknowledged that antimony, like other metals, can form sulfides, oxides, and other compounds as it is recognized as an element.
the primary meaning of the ancient terms for antimony often refers to kohl, which is the sulfide compound of antimony.
in a report published in 2011, antimony was recognized as one of the 12 crucial raw materials for the eu, mainly because of the limited availability of supply from sources other than china.
the roskill report indicates that antimony production decreased in china in 2010 and is not expected to rise in the near future.
china has not developed any major antimony deposits in approximately a decade, and the existing economically viable reserves are being exhausted quickly.
based on data from the usgs, the existing worldwide stores of antimony are projected to run out in 13 years.
nonetheless, the usgs anticipates the discovery of additional resources.
antimony is utilized in the production of bullets, including bullet tracers, as well as in the creation of paint and glass art projects, and as an opacifier in enamel.
wheeler is acknowledged as a significant british archaeologist from the 20th century who played a key role in promoting public interest in archaeology in britain and improving excavation and recording techniques.
additionally, he is known for his contributions to south asian archaeology.
despite his achievements, some of his theories about archaeological sites have been disproved or reevaluated, and he faced criticism for mistreating colleagues and engaging in sexual harassment of young women.
in 1899, wheeler enrolled at bradford grammar school when he was almost nine years old, starting in the second form.
in 1902, his parents had a second daughter named betty, but wheeler didn't show much interest in his younger sister.
in 1905, his father took on a new position at the yorkshire daily observer in london and the family moved to a house called carlton lodge in west dulwich.
after relocating to herne hill in 1908, wheeler, at the age of 15, was encouraged to pursue his education independently.
he spent his time in london visiting art galleries like the national gallery and the victoria and albert museum.
in october 1917, wheeler joined the 76th army field artillery brigade, part of the royal field artillery units led by the general officer commanding, third army.
the brigade was stationed in belgium at the time, involved in the battle of passchendaele on the western front against german forces.
wheeler assumed command of an artillery battery upon arrival, stepping in for a major incapacitated by mustard gas.
his role as acting major placed him in the left group of artillery supporting advancing allied infantry in the battle.
he stayed in touch with his family through letters during this time.
following the allies' success in the battle, the brigade was relocated to italy.
shortly after starting at the museum, wheeler was chosen to serve on the council of the society of antiquaries.
he became part of discussions on financing archaeological oversight of construction projects in greater london, advocating for the city of london corporation to provide funding.
however, it was ultimately decided in 1926 that the society would appoint its own excavation director based at lancaster house.
wheeler was also involved in the royal archaeological institute and played a role in moving it to lancaster house.
he began an unpaid teaching position at university college london in 1927, where he established a graduate program in archaeology, with one of the first students being stuart piggott.
wheeler curated an exhibit at ucl in 1928 titled "recent work in british archaeology," which garnered significant media coverage.
focusing on southern india, wheeler found remnants of a roman amphora in a museum and conducted excavations at arikamedu, uncovering a first-century ce port that traded goods with the roman empire.
despite facing challenges like heavy rains and heat during the dig, wheeler rewarded workers with an extra rupee when world war ii ended.
some claim wheeler took undue credit for the discovery, suggesting it was previously recognized by a.
wheeler later excavated six megalithic tombs in brahmagiri, mysore, allowing him to establish a chronology for much of southern indian archaeology.
as his marriage deteriorated and his wife returned to england, he wanted to end his stay in india early but worried about his financial future, so he urgently sought a new job.
with the help of colleagues in british archaeology, he was offered a position as the secretary of the royal commission on ancient monuments for wales.
although he was disappointed by the lower professional status and income, he declined the offer and instead accepted a role as a professor in roman provinces archaeology at the institute of archaeology.
moreover, he was invited to serve as the archaeological adviser to the pakistani government by the minister of education.
he agreed on the condition that he would only be required to spend a few months in the country each year for the next three years.
the species can be found all over the world, excluding very cold regions.
it is abundant in temperate and tropical areas and has been observed in various continents including africa, asia, australia, europe, north america, and south america.
in traditional chinese medicine, earthstar has been utilized as a hemostatic agent, where the spore dust is applied externally to stop bleeding wounds and alleviate chilblains.
the baiga and bharia tribes from the forests of madhya pradesh in india have also been known to use the fruit bodies of this fungus for medicinal purposes.
they mix the spore mass with mustard seed oil to create a salve that helps treat burns.
similarly, the blackfoot tribe in north america referred to the fungus as "fallen stars," viewing them as stars that had descended to the earth during mystical occurrences.
throughout his career, anderson has received six academy award nominations, and his films have garnered an additional fourteen nominations for their cast and crew.
in december 2009, anderson began working on a new script provisionally titled the master, which focused on a "charismatic intellectual" who establishes a new religion in the 1950s.
a colleague of anderson shared that this film concept had been brewing in anderson's mind for approximately twelve years.
although the film does not directly allude to the specific movement, many have widely assumed it to be inspired by scientology.
the master premiered on september 14, 2012, distributed by the weinstein company in the us and canada, and was well-received critically.
at the 85th academy awards, the film garnered three nominations: joaquin phoenix for best leading actor, philip seymour hoffman for best supporting actor, and amy adams for best supporting actress.
the wolf is compared to an oppressive individual, while the fox represents evil forces.
the farmer symbolizes a virtuous person who is criticized by these negative influences.

nathan completed his high school education at pine bush high school in pine bush, new york in 1992.
during his time there, he participated in basketball, baseball, and track.
despite receiving little attention from division iii colleges, he ultimately enrolled at stony brook university.
this decision was influenced by the connection between his high school assistant coach jeff masionet and stony brook's baseball coach matt senk, who had previously been teammates at the state university of new york at cortland.
nathan was reported to have a tear in his ulnar collateral ligament on march 9, 2010.

jim spigelman, the chairman of abc, strongly criticized the federal government's proposed anti-discrimination law, contending that it could jeopardize freedom of speech.
spigelman, a former chief justice of new south wales, argued that the inclusion of the term "offending" in the definition of discrimination lacked justification.
the legislation aims to streamline various anti-discrimination laws, notably in areas such as racial discrimination, which prohibits offensive treatment.
the new law broadens the concept of "offending" to encompass all forms of discrimination.
during an address on human rights day, spigelman highlighted that existing commonwealth acts on sex, disability, and age discrimination did not address conduct that was solely offensive.
he emphasized the vital role of the freedom to offend in safeguarding freedom of speech, stating, "there is no inherent right to not be offended." spigelman underscored that neither international human rights agreements nor anti-discrimination laws in other democratic nations extended to actions that were merely deemed offensive.
education reporter cindy huang, for the capital's three-part series, investigated teacher experience levels across 12 public high schools using a 2016 database of school employees.
the database, acquired through a public information request, provided details on salaries, years of experience, and turnover rates for classroom teachers, including department chairs.
the analysis focused on how many teachers at each school started the year with three years or less of experience.
huang interviewed various individuals over a span of four months, including teachers, former teachers from identified "challenge schools," superintendent george arlotto, speaker of the maryland house michael e.
busch, as well as parents, students, union leaders, and national education researchers.
the dataset covered all employees in the unit i employee union, under the representation of the teachers association of anne arundel county.

with his substantial political following, donald trump has the potential to launch a new television network named trump tv targeting the anti-establishment audience if unsuccessful in the presidential election.
speculation arose when his close adviser and son-in-law, jared kushner, who also owns the new york observer, approached potential investors about this idea.
despite trailing in the polls behind hillary clinton, trump has mentioned briefly his desire for a vacation post-election.
however, experts believe that a trump tv network could be a highly influential and profitable platform for him to sustain his public visibility, promote his political views, and criticize the establishment in politics and the media industry.

in an emotional development in pittsburgh, jordan staal's wish for a family reunion was fulfilled by the pittsburgh penguins.
the team traded the skilled center to the carolina hurricanes during the nhl draft held in pittsburgh.
staal, who played a key role in the penguins' 2009 stanley cup victory, had one year remaining on his current contract and had shown reluctance to sign an extension.
instead of prolonging negotiations, the penguins decided to trade him to the hurricanes, where he will team up with his brother, eric staal, and potentially with their brother, jared staal, who is currently in the ahl.
in return for staal, pittsburgh acquired center brandon sutter and defenseman brian dumoulin, along with carolina's first-round pick in the draft, which they used to secure defenseman derrick pouliot.
the trade, announced by nhl commissioner gary bettman, created a buzz at the event, with penguins' general manager ray shero expressing gratitude to staal for his contributions as the crowd at consol energy center cheered for the pick.
this marked a poignant conclusion to staal's successful tenure with pittsburgh as the team's former teammates were expected to attend his wedding over the weekend.
historian james holland delves into the harrowing tale of the battle for malta, a pivotal and exceedingly brutal chapter of the second world war.
malta, a diminutive mediterranean island smaller than the isle of wight, bore the brunt of relentless bombings between 1940 and 1942, surpassing the blitz on britain.
enduring incessant airstrikes and dire living conditions, the maltese people teetered on the brink of starvation amidst axis forces' relentless assault.
king george vi's personal acknowledgment of their resilience led to the awarding of the george cross to the entire island.
however, holland posits in his documentary that malta's offensive significance has been overshadowed.
positioned at the heart of a fierce british-german struggle for dominance in the mediterranean's shipping lanes, by 1942, malta had earned the dubious honor of being the most heavily bombed place on the planet.
despite its small size, the intensity of attacks underscored the island's strategic importance, as it held the key to the entire mediterranean and north african theater of war.
recent migrants in australia often face high levels of ethnic or religious discrimination, as indicated by a comprehensive new survey.
despite the prevailing stereotype of australians being caring and hospitable, the reality for many migrants is quite different according to the research conducted by monash university.
this study comes at a crucial time as the abbott government plans to amend aspects of the racial discrimination law.
the findings of the survey, set to be published on monday, shed light on the fears of many migrants about personal safety, with concerns such as walking alone at night or becoming victims of crime being prevalent.
the survey, part of the ongoing series "mapping social cohesion" supported by the scanlon foundation and the federal government, marks a significant step in understanding the experiences of recent migrants in comparison to the broader australian population.
it reveals that migrants who have arrived in the past two decades often feel targeted due to their skin color or religious beliefs, leading to a notable lack of trust in both fellow individuals and governmental institutions unlike the wider population.
the incessant barking of the neighbors' dog persists even as they leave the house, as if they have a routine to switch him on.
despite my attempt to drown out the noise by closing all windows and playing a beethoven symphony at full volume, his barking remains audible underneath the music.
it's as if he has now become a part of the orchestra, confidently barking throughout the piece.
even when the symphony ends, the dog continues to bark from his spot in the oboe section, capturing the attention of the conductor and the rest of the musicians, turning his persistent barking into a legendary, avant-garde solo that defines beethoven's innovative genius.
recently, rick ross made an appearance on power 105's breakfast club show to discuss his upcoming album, black market, set to be released the next day.
along with insights into the album, ross talked about his new track, "color money," addressing speculation that certain lines in the song took aim at drake and birdman.

regarding the issue of ghostwriting in rap, ross shared his perspective, highlighting the importance of creating authentic music and noting the potential concerns when an artist's entire body of work is penned by another.
although ross mentioned a forthcoming track, "ghostwriter," from his album, the discussion also delved into the broader topic of ghostwriting in the industry.
for those interested, ross' black market is now available for pre-order on itunes.
in his inaugural season at uconn, the huskies struggled with a 9-19 record, but that would mark the only losing season under his leadership.
their fortunes changed dramatically as the huskies clinched the nit title in 1988 and just two years later, made a remarkable run to the ncaa elite eight with tate george's unforgettable shot against clemson.

however, they were intercepted by chinese troops and repatriated back to north korea.
this incident followed another event where two north korean soldiers killed their superior officer and fled across the border to china's jilin province.
these occurrences have raised concerns among experts regarding the activities within the north korean army units stationed along the chinese border.
sources from beijing and yanji have confirmed the details of the soldiers' attempted defection and subsequent capture by chinese forces, shedding light on the tense situation unfolding in the region.
the chick evans caddie scholarship is an esteemed program that offers a full tuition and housing college scholarship for golf caddies, which can be renewed for up to four years.
annually, over 960 deserving caddies nationwide are granted a four-year scholarship by the evans scholars foundation.
successful candidates are required to showcase a solid caddie background, exceptional academic performance, remarkable character, and verifiable financial need.
since its inception in 1930 with the enrollment of the first two evans scholars at northwestern university, over 10,830 exceptional individuals have been honored with evans scholarships.
the majority of scholars attend one of the 16 universities housing an evans scholars foundation scholarship house.
these scholarship houses provide a unique environment where scholars reside and collaborate, electing officers, organizing social and service events, and engaging in campus activities.
the chapters are recognized for their academic excellence and community involvement, facilitating the development of leadership skills and effective communication among evans scholars.

compared to other campus organizations, the scholarship houses consistently excel in academics and community service.
additionally, evans scholars reside in designated residence halls at five additional universities.
in columbus, ohio, a new house bill, introduced by state rep.
ron maag, is proposing legislation that would permit concealed handguns in churches, day-care centers, aircraft, state buildings, airports (outside security checkpoints), and publicly accessible areas within police stations.
this bill resembles a previous gun bill advocated by the warren county republican in the past session.
additionally, the proposal would grant conceal-carry permit holders the right to store handguns in their vehicles in school safety zones, as opposed to only allowing concealed weapons during pick-up or drop-off activities.
under the bill, public and private universities and colleges could opt to allow concealed handguns on campus.
schools choosing this option would receive legal immunity for any resultant injuries or deaths.
despite the ohio house being largely controlled by the gop with a 65-seat majority, the bill's future remains uncertain.
presently, hb 48 has garnered 10 co-sponsors, all republicans, albeit many of them being first-term legislators with limited influence.
according to a recent survey conducted by cbs news, the majority of americans are not in favor of president trump's approach to healthcare.
the poll revealed that only 32 percent of respondents approve of the way trump is handling healthcare, while a significantly higher number, 59 percent, disapprove.
additionally, the survey showed that 45 percent of participants disapprove of trump's management of the economy, and 57 percent disapprove of his handling of immigration.
overall, 69 percent of americans hold a positive view of the economy, with only 30 percent holding a negative view.
the poll also indicates that trump's job approval rating is negative, with only 36 percent of respondents approving of his performance, compared to 58 percent who disapprove.
these findings come in the wake of the failed gop attempt to repeal and replace obamacare, prompting debates among lawmakers regarding the next steps relating to healthcare and other legislative priorities, such as tax reform.
the poll, conducted from august 3 to 6 among 1,111 adults, has a margin of error of 4 percentage points.
although breakfast in bed and a homemade card are thoughtful gestures, many mothers consider a cuddle and a kiss to be the best mother's day gift.
red panda eilish recently received plenty of affection from her baby twins during their public debut at the national zoo and aquarium in canberra.
the adorable yet-to-be-named pair did not disappoint in terms of cuteness, but coordinating them for a photo session proved to be a challenge.
the male cub preferred to stay hidden in the trees while his more outgoing sister happily posed with their mother eilish for pictures and even received a nose rub.
as part of an international red panda breeding program, the zoo in canberra has a successful track record, with the latest twins continuing the trend.
born in a den during the summer and emerging with thick coats in the autumn, these cubs, natives of the eastern himalayas and south-western china, are well-equipped to face canberra's cold winter, which is their most active time of year.
although smaller than their cousins, the giant pandas, red pandas share a similar affinity for bamboo.
in rome, reports indicated that over 400 migrants were feared to have drowned in the mediterranean on monday due to the capsizing of four boats and the sinking of another one.
egyptian sources, as cited by bbc arabic, mentioned that the majority of the victims were somali migrants who had embarked on the journey from egypt to italy.
the tragic incident occurred after the migrants departed egypt on a thursday and were en route to italy, as per social media reports.
italian president sergio mattarella referred to it as a "migrant tragedy" while speaking at an event in rome, emphasizing the necessity for europe to contemplate following yet another catastrophic loss of life in the mediterranean involving potentially hundreds of victims.
although the specifics were not disclosed, unconfirmed reports suggested that survivors were rescued and taken to a greek island.
the italian coast guard, however, denied any knowledge of the reported disaster, although they were engaged in saving 108 migrants from a sinking rubber dinghy near libya where six individuals perished.
the distressed boat, carrying individuals from various african nations including gambia, guinea bissau, nigeria, and ethiopia, was described by sos mediterranee as being in distress for nine hours in rough seas, with a deflated hull, leaking water, and a malfunctioning engine.
this heartbreaking event serves as a poignant reminder of the dangers faced by migrants and refugees at sea, with a haunting reference made to the similar tragic incident in april last year when nearly 800 lives were lost in a similar maritime disaster near the island of lampedusa.
multiple research studies have highlighted the potential antibacterial properties of melaleuca alternifolia, commonly known as tea tree essential oil.
the study discussed here aimed to replicate a 2004 in vitro experiment in humans by using a dressing model over petri dishes to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of tea tree essential oil vapors.
for this current study, the same dressing model was applied to patients with wounds infected by staphylococcus aureus.
ten individuals participated in this quasi-experimental research, with four of them paired up to compare healing times when receiving conventional treatment alone or supplemented with tea tree oil vapors.
the findings revealed quicker healing times in most participants treated with tea tree oil, showing significant differences between the matched pairs.
these initial results suggest the need for further investigation through larger-scale studies.
today, liverpool's rising talent rhian brewster took part in training with the first team at melwood, capping off another productive week in his development.
the 17-year-old prospect notably shone during the liverpool u23s match on monday, contributing significantly to their 3-1 away victory against leicester by scoring the equalizer and providing assists to teammates matty virtue and harry wilson.
this performance helped mick garrity's squad maintain their third place in the premier league 2 standings.
despite only securing his first u18s start earlier this year, brewster has quickly progressed, now benefiting from a more regular role with the u23s following the loan departure of brooks lennon.
demonstrating his prowess, the youngster also impressed during a closed-door friendly against accrington stanley at melwood, where he netted a hat-trick.
brewster's consistent display of talent has not only caught the eye of liverpool but also earned him praise while representing england throughout the season.
according to a senior malaysian air force official as reported by cnn, the missing malaysia airlines plane continued flying for approximately one hour and 10 minutes following its disappearance from radar screens over the south china sea.
the aircraft, which deviated significantly from its intended route from kuala lumpur to beijing, was said to have travelled hundreds of kilometers off course with its communication systems deliberately disabled.
the last known sighting of the plane was above pulau perak in the strait of malacca.
the perplexing situation of the plane flying in the wrong direction has further deepened the mystery surrounding its fate, prompting concerns of either a hijacking or a potential technical malfunction leading the pilots astray.
the tail anatomy of unenlagiid theropods is not well understood, with the most comprehensive and informative specimen being buitreraptor gonzalezorum from the upper cretaceous of rio negro province, argentina.
this study aims to analyze the tail anatomy of buitreraptor using both the holotype and a newly discovered specimen.
shared characteristics between buitreraptor, rahonavis, anchiornis, and archaeopteryx include mid-caudal vertebrae with postzygapophyses longer than prezygapophyses, as well as mid-caudal centra with a system of lateral laminae and concavities.
examination of paravian skeletons and muscular reconstruction reveals the presence of two distinct functional sections in the tail.
this research illuminates the evolution of paravian tails and offers new insights into the tail modifications that occurred along the theropod lineage leading to modern birds.
in an upcoming crossover episode of family guy next year, fox has announced that the simpsons will meet the griffins in an episode called the simpsons guy.
the plot involves the griffins embarking on a road trip that leads them to springfield, where they are warmly welcomed by the simpson family.
the episode will feature guest appearances by the simpsons voice actors dan castellaneta, julie kavner, nancy cartwright, yeardley smith, and hank azaria.
scheduled to air in the us next autumn, the episode will explore the budding friendships between the two families, with stewie bonding with bart, lisa mentoring meg, marge and lois choosing bonding time over housework, and peter and homer engaging in a friendly rivalry over the beer in their respective towns.
both homer simpson and peter griffin shared their excitement about the crossover.

the aftermath of a confrontation involving a toronto reporter and a group of men planning to shout offensive remarks into her microphone at a soccer game continues to unfold.
maple leaf sports and entertainment is actively working to identify the four men involved in the 'fhritp' stunt from the past weekend, with intentions to enforce a likely one-year ban from its venues.
the organization has decided to withhold the identities of the individuals involved.
during coverage of a toronto fc soccer game on sunday, shauna hunt, a citynews reporter, faced obscenities from at least three men, leading her to confront a group defending the inappropriate behavior.
citynews broadcasted the incident, triggering ongoing repercussions.
in a development two days later, hydro one dismissed one of its employees in connection with the event.
recent developments have shown that the global governing body has engaged with at least one potential candidate to form a temporary panel that could succeed ffa chairman steven lowy and his current board.
the individual in question is australian, a reassuring prospect that potentially dispels concerns about fifa appointing foreign officials with limited understanding of the local soccer landscape.
when pressed for a comment on these discussions with prospective members of the normalization committee, a fifa representative declined to provide details, citing a policy of non-disclosure on such matters.
nonetheless, historically, fifa has favored selecting individuals with legal, political, or business backgrounds tied to the country's sports administration for these roles.
countries like cameroon, argentina, and guinea have witnessed similar fifa interventions in the past 18 months.
notably, the installation of a normalization committee would be a temporary solution aimed at overseeing reforms to ffa's governance structure and operational matters until new elections can be held, with current members excluded from candidacy.
with the looming fifa deadline of november 30 drawing closer, ongoing discussions between key stakeholders - a-league clubs, state federations, and professional footballers australia - are essential to reach a consensus on the structure of an expanded congress.
however, the a-league clubs hold significant influence in these talks and could potentially delay proceedings to achieve their objective of reshaping ffa leadership.
a recent proposal by the state federations for a 9-4-1-1 vote distribution has been met with resistance from the clubs and pfa due to concerns that it grants excessive influence to the states in electing ffa board members independently.

the mother and uncle of a canadian woman who was killed 14 years ago have been ordered to be extradited to india to stand trial for her alleged "honour killing".
malkit kaur sidhu and surjit singh badesha are being accused of orchestrating the murder after jaswinder sidhu, 25, married a rickshaw driver, going against her family's wishes.
she was brutally murdered in punjab in june 2000 when she visited there to reunite with her husband.
the family denies any involvement in sidhu's tragic death and is considering appealing the decision.
multiple individuals have already been convicted for the crime in india.
sidhu's mother and uncle were arrested in 2012 on charges of conspiracy to commit murder.
recently, british columbia supreme court justice gregory fitch ruled for their extradition to india to face the charges.
the family disapproved of jaswinder's marriage to mithu sidhu rather than the older wealthy man they preferred.
after discovering her secret marriage, she fled to india to be with her husband.
unfortunately, they were attacked while riding a motor scooter - he was physically assaulted, while she lost her life.
prosecutors claim mr badesha communicated extensively with the individuals eventually found guilty of the murder via numerous phone calls, especially after jaswinder's marriage was exposed.
while the family's lawyers acknowledge their disapproval of the marriage, they argue that it does not imply their involvement in jaswinder's killing.
malkit kaur sidhu and surjit singh badesha will remain in canadian custody until their extradition, with the possibility of an appeal.

melvyn bragg and his guests delve into the timeless tale of tristan and iseult, which originated in the 12th century through the works of thomas of britain, beroul, gottfried of strasbourg, and wagner.
tristan and iseult's story, deeply rooted in celtic mythology, gained immense popularity during the middle ages.
originating in british literature shortly after the norman conquest, the narrative quickly transcended borders across northern europe.
the legend follows the fateful encounter of tristan, a cornish knight, and iseult, an irish queen, who accidentally consume a love potion while journeying together to cornwall on the same vessel.
despite being betrothed to tristan's king, mark, tristan and iseult's love is deemed heroic yet poses moral dilemmas regarding their adultery, particularly amidst the strict teachings of the medieval church.
guests discussing this captivating story include laura ashe, associate professor of english at worcester college, university of oxford; juliette wood, associate lecturer in the school of welsh at cardiff university; and mark chinca, reader in medieval german literature at the university of cambridge.

pope francis has given his approval for the establishment of a new vatican department dedicated to addressing cases involving bishops who neglect to safeguard children from abusive priests.
this historic decision represents a significant advancement in the vatican's efforts to hold bishops responsible for concealing or failing to prevent instances of child sexual abuse within the catholic church.
the vatican announced that pope francis endorsed the recommendations put forth by his advisory board on sexual abuse.
comprising nine men and eight women, including clerics and lay individuals, the international commission's mandate is to aid dioceses in implementing preventative measures and supporting victims, ensuring the adoption of "best practices." advocacy groups for victims have persistently called for the vatican to introduce transparent protocols that promote bishops' accountability for abuse within their dioceses, irrespective of their direct involvement.
although no bishop has been forcibly removed for shielding offending clergy before, pope francis accepted the resignation of a us bishop in april following his conviction for negligence in reporting a suspected child abuser.
anticipated iranian reactions could encompass a range of actions, from potential support for hezbollah in lebanon to launch attacks on northern israel, to more measured responses.
although there is a prevailing hope for iran to exercise restraint, there remains a looming possibility of a significant regional conflict involving the united states and nations in the persian gulf, resulting in a surge in oil prices.
the obama administration emphasizes that all potential responses are being considered concerning iran's nuclear activities but is explicitly against israel acting unilaterally due to risks posed to american troops in afghanistan and iraq.
iran's connections with militant factions in these countries could lead to an escalation in weapon provisions should an assault occur, viewed by much of the muslim world as having tacit approval from the us.
such a scenario would not only complicate efforts to disengage from ongoing conflicts but also undermine america's image in the muslim world.
an attack could fortify iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad's hard-line stance, fostering a cohesive national response that would diminish opposition and bolster his influence across muslim communities.

real madrid must have once again shed tears at the plaza de cibeles as they saw him showcase his brilliance by dominating napoli in the first half.
ozil's exceptional talent, showcased effortlessly and effectively, will undoubtedly be the subject of numerous articles and enthusiastic blog posts this season.
whether effortlessly setting up goals, smoothly evading defenders, or elegantly maneuvering the ball, ozil's calm demeanor masks the devastating impact he has on the game.
operating on his unique rhythm, ozil's performance on the field is dictated by his unwavering belief in using the ball as a potent weapon.
at just 24 years old, ozil brings a winning mentality to arsenal, having amassed an impressive list of achievements including a spanish league title with real madrid in 2011-2012, a european under-21 championship victory with germany, and a german cup triumph with bremen.
unlike other flashy attacking midfielders, ozil prioritizes effectiveness over aesthetics.

capcom inquired about the introductions and roles within marvel.
sean chen, with two decades of experience in the comic book industry, notably worked on iron man, as well as projects involving wolverine, x-men, spider-man, and the avengers.
currently, chen divides his time between creating covers and special projects for various comic publishers and crafting storyboards for television commercials in the advertising field.
gerardo sandoval shared his background, having contributed to titles like age of apocalypse, x-men, guardians 3000, new avengers, wolverine, and venom.
when asked about favorite characters to illustrate from both marvel and capcom universes, chen expressed his enthusiasm for drawing iron man due to his affinity for tech and the intriguing mix of character types in the comics.
he found morrigan from the capcom side the most enjoyable to draw for her unique design, along with the lively personalities of characters like storm and viewtiful joe.
on the other hand, sandoval revealed a preference for villains and anti-heroes such as venom, wolverine, sagat, and zangief, relishing the complexity and depth they bring to his art as opposed to traditional heroes.
sandoval's gaming history also influenced his choice, as he found playing as a villain more appealing than embodying virtuous characters.

tom brady's frustration with the lack of available weapons on the new england patriots' offense is apparent.
the departures of wes welker and brandon lloyd continue to impact the team's performance.
the absence of key players like rob gronkowski and shane vereen due to injuries has further weakened the unit.
however, the injury to wide receiver danny amendola is particularly worrisome.
his absence during the game against the new york jets on thursday night football highlighted the struggles of the patriots' passing game.
rookie receivers aaron dobson and kenbrell thompkins appeared to struggle to connect with brady effectively.
relying solely on julian edelman may not be a sustainable strategy in the long run.
even upon the return of injured players, such as gronkowski and amendola, the team will require additional depth.
given the injury histories of gronkowski and amendola, it is evident that the patriots need to bolster their wide receiver corps with a veteran presence.
while re-signing lloyd would have been a simple solution, it seems unlikely as he has expressed no interest in returning to the game.
therefore, it remains crucial for the patriots to explore other veteran wide receiver options to enhance their offensive capabilities.
emily hetherington, a 26-year-old sailor from queanbeyan, nsw, is taking legal action against the department of defence for neglecting to detect her pregnancy, leading to unforeseen costs associated with raising her child.
she is pursuing compensation for pain, suffering, and loss of earnings, stating that had her pregnancy been identified earlier, she would have chosen not to proceed with the pregnancy.
during medical evaluations on january 14, 2008, in hobart, shortly after joining the royal australian navy, ms hetherington discovered her pregnancy at 22 weeks when it was too late for termination.
despite undergoing a urinary pregnancy test which yielded a negative result, she was unaware of her pregnancy at the time.
police in northeast philly are currently on the hunt for the individual responsible for stealing a vehicle belonging to a paramedic from burholme emergency medical services.
with nearly 85 years of service to the community, the ems team is dedicated to providing round-the-clock emergency care to residents.
ems supervisor blake bradley expressed his dismay at the recent break-in at the non-profit organization's headquarters on bleigh avenue, where a burglar gained entry through a rear kitchen window, taking off with a white 2016 jeep compass after locating two sets of car keys.
the suspect left behind an identifiable fingerprint on the window, with surveillance footage capturing the break-in and the thief driving away in the stolen suv.
bradley condemned the aggressive act, emphasizing the hard work and dedication of their dispatcher whose vehicle was taken.
this incident marks the first time in the squad's 80-year history that they have experienced a robbery, prompting increased security measures at their facility.
as investigations continue, bradley appeals to the public for information leading to the recovery of the stolen vehicle and the apprehension of the culprit.
should anyone have relevant details, they are encouraged to reach out to northeast detectives.
in a disneyland paris hotel, a man who was discovered with guns was sentenced by a french court to six months of house arrest and ordered to wear an electronic monitoring device.
the 28-year-old individual, who was carrying two handguns, ammunition, and a copy of the koran when apprehended, had prosecutors aiming for a nine-month suspended sentence.
the guns were caught during a routine bag scan at the hotel entrance.
this incident unfolded just a month after police were alerted to a similar situation where a man tried to check-in with two handguns at disneyland paris.
the man, a paris restaurant worker and recent convert to islam who voiced concerns for his safety as his reason for carrying the guns, will serve his sentence under house arrest at his mother's residence in the loiret region near paris.
the court, based in meaux near the french capital, also prohibited him from possessing firearms for five years.
he explained to the court that he purchased the weapons for self-defense after being a victim of aggression and acquired the second gun following the november 13 terrorist assaults in paris.
despite his unconventional choices, investigations have dismissed any associations with terrorist intentions, especially given the climate of recent islamist attacks in paris.
given the opportunity presented by 'car sos' from the national geographic channel, we were entrusted with the task of restoring two cars for the third season of this highly acclaimed tv series.
one of the vehicles we worked on during this season was a 1963 alfa romeo giulia spider.
initially, the car seemed to be in decent condition, but upon closer inspection, we were surprised by the amount of underseal and filler present underneath.
to address this, we took the precaution of stripping the shell and arranging for it to undergo a chemical dipping process.
upon the shell's return, we discovered extensive repair work that had been performed on the car throughout its years on the road, with numerous patches and subpar welds evident.
working with the bare metal enabled us to efficiently carry out the necessary fabrication work, compensating for the time lost during the chemical treatment.
we ensured a comprehensive restoration by solidly welding the body and installing a new front panel before meticulously preparing the surfaces for the bianco pininfarina paint application.
the suspension overhaul and painting were completed in-house, while the engine underwent specialized attention from an alfa romeo expert.
the finishing touches with the trim were expertly executed by aldridge in walsall.
exploring the challenges faced by individuals surviving in extreme altitudes, where nature's harshness is at its peak, from dense cloud forests to barren summits.
as elevation increases on the mountain, life becomes more demanding.
the documentary human planet delves into the remarkable strategies employed by people to endure these unforgiving environments.
for instance, in the altai mountains of western mongolia, the vast terrain makes hunting difficult, leading locals to form a remarkable alliance with golden eagles, enlisting them for assistance in hunting.
meanwhile, in the rugged cliffs of ethiopia's simien mountains, we witness a young boy engaged in a fierce confrontation with intimidating gelada monkeys intent on pillaging his family's scarce grain reserves.
additionally, in nepal's himalayan region, a rare and unique sky burial ritual is observed.
as timber for cremation is scarce and traditional burial methods unfeasible, the deceased are consigned to vultures as a profound tribute to nature's cycle.
bandai namco's announcement of a pc version of dark souls was met with great enthusiasm.
however, the news that it would be released on the unpopular games for windows live platform sparked widespread frustration.
fortunately, there is now some positive news to share: starting in november, players who currently own dark souls on gfwl will have the option to switch over to steam.
during the upcoming month, users will be able to exchange their gfwl tokens on steam to gain access to dark souls.
while this migration will be an ongoing process, the transfer of saved data and achievements will only be feasible for a limited period.
bandai namco mentioned today that they will soon provide more specific dates for the transition.
despite gfwl's impending discontinuation, the publisher had previously announced plans to support dark souls players still using the platform.
as one of the few remaining titles connected to gfwl, most developers and publishers have already moved on to other services.
the allegation is that palin violated state ethics regulations by conducting national television interviews regarding her vice presidential candidacy from the governor's office.
this issue arises amidst ongoing media scrutiny of palin's personal life, political ambitions, and public statements.
zane henning, a resident of wasilla who works on the north slope, submitted the complaint to the attorney general, accusing palin of using state resources to advance her political aspirations, citing a specific fox news channel interview on nov.
henning claimed that palin's actions were aimed at improving her tarnished image in national politics.
while the palin team acknowledged the abundance of interview requests, they emphasized that she was no longer a candidate during those interviews.
in response to the complaint, palin's spokesperson bill mcallister highlighted the confidential nature of the process for considering complaints under the executive branch ethics act.
republican party frontrunner donald trump's hollywood star has been recently defaced and dirtied by both humans and their pets.
the us presidential hopeful earned his star on the hollywood walk of fame in 2007 after the success of the reality tv show, the apprentice.
however, the gold and brass star has now fallen victim to vandalism, which includes a spray-painted swastika and pet waste.
according to the los angeles times, many americans are expressing their disapproval of the real estate mogul's rhetoric and policy plans through such actions.
despite the damage, officials at the walk of fame have stated that they have no intention of removing the star.
"the hollywood walk of fame is a registered historic landmark," explained leron gubler, president of the hollywood chamber of commerce, the entity that manages the walk of fame.
gubler emphasized that once a star has been installed on the walkway, it becomes an integral part of the site's historical legacy.
imagine trying to operate a computer without a monitor.
how would you navigate where to click, type, or visualize the images on your screen?
these are genuine struggles faced by individuals who are blind or visually impaired.
for many of us, contemplating using a computer or accessing the internet without sight may be unfamiliar territory.
despite being somewhat disconnected from the conventional internet experience, visually impaired individuals find ways to utilize it just like everyone else.
although using computers without sight presents difficulties, the innovative solutions that have been developed are impressive and continuously improving.
recent technological advancements such as smartphones, wearables, and smart devices offer great potential to benefit the visually impaired community even more than the sighted.
however, without assistance from sighted individuals, many online functions that we take for granted may remain inaccessible to those who are visually impaired.
the first essential step towards change is to understand these challenges.
embark on a journey through an unseen aspect of the web, led by those who possess the most insightful perspectives.
the recent ruling stands out as a rare instance where an individual owner or director of a company has been successfully prosecuted for violating heritage laws, potentially establishing a precedent for other sydney councils striving to protect heritage sites.
"developers often shield themselves behind their companies, but in this particular case, the council went after the company's owner directly," stated rochelle porteous, the mayor of leichhardt.
porteous emphasized that this significant legal outcome serves as a stern warning to developers contemplating bypassing heritage regulations.
"our aim was to underscore the importance of preserving heritage.
any demolition or alteration of structures must adhere to the council's planning guidelines," she asserted.
porteous disclosed that following the milestone ruling, several sydney councils reached out to leichhardt’s legal team to commend them on the successful litigation and inquire about the strategies that led to this achievement.
according to a team of european researchers, the belief that cyclists doping with epo gain a performance advantage is unfounded.
despite the health risks involved, there is no concrete evidence supporting the idea that epo enhances cyclists' performance.
following lance armstrong's disqualification from his tour de france titles due to doping, including epo use, it has been highlighted that using this drug illicitly can lead to severe health issues like blood clots resulting in strokes and heart attacks.
adam cohen, a professor at the centre for human drug research in the netherlands, emphasizes the lack of scientific experiments proving epo's performance benefits in elite cyclists, cautioning against the widespread misconception in the field.
according to the police, one fatality occurred and more than 25 individuals were injured during the unrest in the kandhamal region on tuesday.
christians asserted that the turmoil arose when hindus objected to a festive performance staged in celebration of christmas.
conversely, a hindu faction revealed that the conflict initiated when christians allegedly attempted to assault a local hindu leader on christmas eve.
they claimed that a gathering encircled the vehicle transporting swami laxamananda saraswati as he journeyed to the area.
although he was hospitalized, his injuries were not severe.
the ensuing violence climaxed in assaults on churches on christmas day, where christians were forced out of various churches – frequently simple mud structures with thatched roofs – before the structures were ignited, as per officials.
reports indicated that one person lost their life in the upheaval, with the identity – hindu or christian – remaining unspecified.
subsequent to the violent incidents, a considerable police force was dispatched, and by wednesday, the situation had considerably calmed, as per a local government official.
bb mishra, a state inspector-general of police, stated, "the situation is tense but under control." orissa, predominantly hindu with a small christian populace, has encountered clashes between the communities previously.
the region enforces a law stipulating that individuals must seek police authorization before switching religions – perceived as a measure primarily affecting christian missionaries.
hindu factions have accused christian organizations of coercing individuals from lower castes to convert, whereas christians argue that conversions are often voluntary due to the discrimination they face as social outcasts.
in a high court hearing, man haron monis, also known as sheik haron, argued that causing emotional harm is not a criminal offense as he responded to accusations of sending offensive letters to families of soldiers who lost their lives in afghanistan.
monis sought to have multiple charges dismissed, claiming that using the postal service to upset the families of deceased soldiers and a trade official killed in jakarta was not a valid legal basis.
monis and his co-appellant, amirah droudis, contended that the section of the commonwealth criminal code in question breached the implied constitutional right to freedom of political expression.
the letters criticized australia's military involvement in afghanistan and disparaged the slain soldiers, attributing blame to the australian nation for the 2009 bombing in indonesia due to its alleged failure to address the government's actions abroad.
according to a report by die welt, a dispute erupted on a sunday evening in a local park after a 32-year-old woman's dog defecated.
when the woman continued walking without cleaning up, a 33-year-old passerby confronted her about the mess.
the situation escalated as the dog owner refused, leading to a heated argument.
the confrontation escalated further when the passerby threw her keys at the woman, hitting her on the head.
a nearby man intervened to separate them, but tensions reignited when the dog owner returned with male companions, resulting in a physical altercation involving five individuals.
police disclosed that during the fight one person even used a club.
in bergisch gladbach, failing to clean up after a dog incurs a fine of 30 euros, and authorities are investigating the incident for serious bodily harm due to injuries sustained during the brawl.
this incident is not unique, as earlier in the year, residents in einbeck, lower saxony, protested negligent dog owners by gathering 250 kg of dog waste from the town's parks and draping it around a local statue.
the most recent data on hospital waiting lists reveals that by the end of september, a total of 534,947 patients were awaiting inpatient, day case treatment, or outpatient clinic appointments.
this number has increased by approximately 3,000 compared to the august statistics, though there has been a decline in the waiting list for gastrointestinal assessments.
the national treatment purchase fund reported that last month, there were 78,696 individuals waiting for inpatient or day case treatment, while 17,984 were in the queue for gastrointestinal checks, representing a decrease of roughly 300 from the previous month.
additionally, 438,267 people were on the list to be seen at outpatient clinics, a rise of more than 3,000 from august.
minister for health simon harris, speaking in limerick today, expressed his expectation for the hse to fulfill its commitment to cutting the number of people waiting over 18 months for inpatient or day case treatment in half by the year's end.
he acknowledged that waiting lists continue to pose a significant challenge, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing those with the longest wait times.

a tragic incident occurred at montreal's la ronde amusement park on friday when an employee, who was performing repairs, inadvertently entered a restricted area and was fatally struck by a passing roller-coaster train.
following the accident, ambulance workers provided assistance to several ride clients and employees who were understandably shaken by the event.
the 67-year-old employee was sadly pronounced dead on the scene, with no attempt at revival due to the severity of his injuries.
la ronde has announced the closure of the ride indefinitely as investigations are carried out.
the amusement park spokesperson expressed the need to understand why the employee accessed the restricted area during his duties.
initial findings suggest that the ride was functioning correctly, the restricted zone was secured, and the employee failed to inform the ride operator about his presence in the area.
la ronde extended its condolences to the family of the deceased employee in a statement, offering thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.
according to a report by bob mckenzie of tsn, joe hicketts from victoria stands out as the sole defenseman at the current camp who was not initially included in the summer camp roster.
although he measures at 5-foot-8 and 175 pounds, he does not possess exceptional physical attributes in terms of size or speed.
additionally, as a 1996-born player, he did not secure a spot with an nhl team in the previous summer draft.
nonetheless, following his participation in detroit's summer prospect camp, as well as his subsequent invitation to the wings' rookie tournament team in traverse city, the undrafted hicketts impressed the wings' management enough to secure an nhl contract.
in the whl, hicketts has proven to be an offensive force this season, leading all whl defensemen in scoring with seven goals and 36 points in 28 games, ranking him fifth overall in the league.
a notable factor in hicketts' development is his relationship with his head coach in victoria, lowry, who will oversee the defensemen for team canada.
while hicketts may not possess the same dynamic playing style as ryan ellis did in 2009 and 2010, he compensates with a determined, hardworking attitude on the ice that contributes to his ability to generate points effectively.
human beings are dual in nature, possessing both physical and psychological aspects, each revealing distinct implications in the realm of business.
the basic demands of individuals have driven the establishment of large corporations in contemporary society.
these extensive multinational entities have thrived by catering to our essential necessities such as clothing, food, shelter, communication, and transportation.
conversely, the psychological facets of human beings, albeit significant, have not significantly impacted the business world.
unlike the extensive corporations meeting material needs, there are limited commercial ventures dedicated to guiding individuals towards the essence of life, fostering benevolence, or ushering them through various life stages.
professionals such as therapists, poets, artists, and intellectuals who delve into the psychological realm often work independently and harbor skepticism towards organizational structures, rendering them akin to small-scale operations.
experts predict that fixed prices for consumer goods and services will become increasingly rare within the next five years, due to a pricing revolution inspired by uber's dynamic pricing model spreading throughout the uk.
this shift towards "peak time" pricing, where costs fluctuate based on demand, is expected to be widely adopted in supermarkets, petrol stations, and on energy bills.
replacing traditional paper price tags, these "e-prices" are directly linked to retailers' computer systems, allowing for adjustments of up to 90% in a single day.
this technology enables stores to swiftly respond to market changes by adjusting prices, such as removing discounts on popular items like ice creams and chilled drinks during heatwaves, or sandwiches during lunchtime.
though this practice is already established in europe and the us, its potential introduction in the uk may provoke a reaction from cost-conscious consumers who are becoming increasingly mindful of their expenditures.
a recently taken photo of andhra pradesh chief minister chandrababu naidu has revealed that the state government has declared an outstanding debt of 17,500 crores earlier this month.
this financial constraint is impacting the ability to assist farmers with loan waivers or enhance urban infrastructure.
despite the state's dire financial situation, the legislators are not facing any financial constraints as 175 members of the legislative assembly have been presented with iphone6 devices.
additionally, around 40 legislative council representatives have also received apple's top-tier smartphones, with the total bill exceeding rs 1 crore, funded by taxpayers.
this gifting trend is a long-standing tradition in andhra pradesh, where lawmakers are gifted with high-end electronic devices like laptops or tablets annually.
chief minister chandrababu naidu, who has recently returned to power after a decade, has chosen to uphold this tradition.
the distribution of the iphones was discreet, with minimal media coverage.
sources reveal that lawmakers were given a choice of smart gadgets to select from, and the iphone6 was the preferred option due to its expensive nature.
despite receiving the iphone, a senior opposition leader from the ysr congress mentioned declining an invitation to a lavish government dinner event.
according to a report by the nelson mail, new zealand bar and restaurant owner fred bennett was surprised when local customers frequented his establishment for thai food but observed no thai visitors.
it wasn't until the departure of the thai chef, who had recommended the new name that was displayed on a sign outside the restaurant in nelson.
upon the chef's exit, bennett learned that the sign actually translated to "welcome and see you again." the misunderstanding became clear when the new chef pointed out that the name implied "go away and don't come back." bennett, feeling regretful, admitted the oversight, stating, "this incident emphasizes the importance of thorough research." he also expressed his apologies to the thai community for any unintended offense caused and subsequently rebranded his restaurant as victory thai.
this week, microsoft subtly criticized google's self-driving car project, suggesting that google could enhance its automated vehicles with microsoft's kinect motion sensor technology.
microsoft's kinect blog post made reference to a recent incident in which a google self-driving car collided with a bus in mountain view, california, highlighting a scenario where the car misjudged the bus's movements.
the blog pondered whether incorporating a kinect sensor could have aided the autonomous car in making a more informed decision.
the university of la laguna in the canary islands also supports this notion, as researchers there are developing a system that utilizes the kinect sensor's infrared depth camera to help self-driving cars detect and navigate around nearby obstacles.
through tests using a self-driving golf cart on a complex road course featuring stairs, ramps, and curbs, researchers found that the kinect sensor surpassed a laser rangefinder and stereo cameras in identifying and distinguishing close-to-the-ground objects.
google has yet to respond to microsoft's kinect blog post.
last week, we delved into how the back cover of game informer's february issue unlocked the secrets of the teaser trailer.
however, let's not overlook the intricately detailed wall showcased in the video.
the close-up views captured in the trailer reveal more than meets the eye.

extensive research has focused on investigating the relationship between a specific polymorphism in the promoter region of the maoa gene and antisocial behavior patterns.
these studies consistently indicate that males exposed to childhood maltreatment with low-activity maoa alleles are more likely to exhibit antisocial tendencies.
recently, new evidence has surfaced suggesting that the rare 2-repeat allele of the maoa gene may influence violent behaviors regardless of environmental factors.
the latest study further explores this concept by examining how the 2-repeat allele is linked to shooting and stabbing behaviors in a cohort of males sourced from the national longitudinal study of adolescent health.
findings demonstrate a notable association between african-american males carrying the 2-repeat allele and the increased likelihood of engaging in shooting and stabbing behaviors, as well as reporting multiple victims.
the study's constraints are deliberated, and recommendations for future investigations are proposed.

this paper, written on april 22, 2016, delves into the institutional factors influencing persecution by examining the severity of black death pogroms in the holy roman empire.
the authors assert that political fragmentation worsened rent-seeking behavior in the empire, resulting in heightened persecutions endured by jewish communities during the black death.
their hypothesis is tested using data on pogrom intensity, historical trade routes, and political and ecclesiastical boundaries.
consistent with their thesis, the study reveals that areas in close proximity to archbishoprics, bishoprics, and imperial free cities witnessed more severe and violent persecutions compared to regions under imperial governance.
the paper also deliberates on the implications of these findings for upholding the rule of law in vulnerable states.
in guatemala city, a woman named inocenta hernandez faced a startling situation when a sinkhole, measuring 40 feet deep and almost 3 feet wide, suddenly opened up under her bed one monday.
initially mistaking the loud boom for a gas canister explosion or a street crash, hernandez and her family were shocked to find the sinkhole right beneath her bed.
this incident reminds locals of the region's susceptibility to sinkholes, such as a major one in may 2010 that was 60 feet wide and 100 feet deep, swallowing buildings and a street intersection.
additionally, a sinkhole in 2007 in barrio san antonio tragically claimed three lives.
fortunately, in hernandez's case, there were no injuries, and she expressed gratitude that only material belongings were damaged, considering her grandchildren often play in the room where the sinkhole appeared.

notably, vehicle components stands out as one of lg's primary subsidiaries earmarked for substantial future business development.

a photo shared on facebook depicts an ambulance en route to a harrowing accident scene in sofia encountering unrestricted passage during an anti-government demonstration.
the sofia city prosecutor's office has formally asked the city hall to provide a written response regarding claims that the protest hindered the ambulance's access to a primary street.
the prosecution has stated that the ambulance, en route to the site of a tragic crash where a taxi collided with a group of pedestrians at a bus stop on wednesday evening, was delayed by 12 minutes due to the demonstration obstructing its route, thus necessitating a detour.
sofia prosecutors have initiated legal actions against an unknown perpetrator and have sought the mayor's opinion on whether protests on major roads and critical intersections should be prohibited.
georgi gelev, director of the emergency medical unit in sofia, has refuted these claims, insisting there were no delays, with all six ambulances reaching the scene within 15 minutes, surpassing the standard 20-minute response time.
gelev highlighted that the first ambulance arrived in just 4 minutes, originating from different hospitals across sofia.
regrettably, one individual succumbed to injuries sustained in the accident, while 11 others were injured, with 4, including a child, in serious condition.
despite this, demonstrators have circulated numerous images and videos on social platforms illustrating the ambulance's unobstructed passage on tsarigradsko shosse.
mayor yordanka fandakova and the sofia police chief have until 12 pm on friday to submit their official views on the matter.

a 17-year-old girl was sexually assaulted twice, by two different men, on a train as she was returning home from a music festival.
the british transport police have described the assaults as "shocking" and reported that they occurred between newquay and plymouth on 12 august.
the initial assault was carried out by a man wearing a novelty shark hat who began tickling the girl after she declined a kiss, prompting her to change seats.
subsequently, another man proceeded to kiss and inappropriately touch the girl.
the victim, who had attended the boardmasters music festival, was on her way home when the attacks happened, between 20:45 and 21:00 bst.
detective constable matt grieve, leading the investigation, stressed the severity of the incident, stating, "this was a deeply distressing and startling occurrence for the young woman, and we are appealing for any potential witnesses to come forward." the first suspect is described as a white man with fair skin and ginger hair, wearing a white shirt adorned with a palm tree, blue shorts, and the distinctive novelty shark hat.
the second perpetrator is a white man with noticeable sideburns, donning a white polo shirt, and identified himself as lance.
this design was actually inspired by a reddit suggestion.
the concept involved creating a unique greatsword capable of launching a shuriken by swinging the blade.
in its sword form, it appears as a typical greatsword-style weapon.
however, it transforms in its secondary form by separating the blades, enabling a shuriken stored at the base to be propelled out with the momentum of the swing.
the intriguing aspect of this weapon is the shuriken itself, which is connected to the sword through a cable that extends up to 20m upon release.
initially compacted, the shuriken expands into a weaponized form once ejected from the blade.
the retractable cable allows the shuriken to be pulled back into the sword after use, with the option to extend its reach by stopping the retraction just before it fully returns.
this extended shuriken can enhance the swing reach of the sword and can be utilized to catch opponents, enabling the user to manipulate the retracting force to either draw in the enemy or reposition themselves.
additionally, the shuriken can serve as a grappling hook by adjusting the blade angles for optimal ledge-catching abilities.
the sword is equipped to store 2 spare shurikens and can disengage the cable from the loaded shuriken in critical situations, where the spares act as emergency backups should the primary shuriken be incapacitated or unretrievable.
a start-up based in san francisco, good2go, aims to simplify the search for clean, well-lit bathrooms in major cities, without the need to touch any surfaces.
their upcoming ios app, set to launch on thursday, will offer users a map displaying nearby bathrooms within private establishments, complete with an estimate of the wait time.
to access these facilities, users simply need to present an app-generated code to a door sensor, eliminating the need for traditional keys or permission requests.
through partnerships with businesses like restaurants and grocery stores, good2go plans to expand its network of accessible bathrooms.
the company's innovation extends to outfitting these restrooms with touchless amenities such as lights, sinks, hand dryers, and toilets, all activated by motion sensors.
additionally, the doors to good2go bathrooms open automatically for added convenience.
a juror, matthew banks, aged 19, was sentenced to two weeks in jail for feigning illness to attend a west end musical in london while serving on a trial at manchester crown court.
the trial was disrupted for a day with other jurors being discharged.
judge martin rudland criticized banks as "frivolous" and sentenced him to a 14-day term at a young offenders' institution.
despite feeling remorseful, judge rudland emphasized the severity of the wrongdoing, stating that deceiving court officials for such trivial reasons constituted contempt of court.
following banks' absence, the remaining 11 jurors continued the trial and reached a verdict, as confirmed by judicial communications office spokespersons.
on thursday, mr johnson will be accompanied by mr gove as he officially announces his candidacy for the conservative party leadership.
during the launch, he is expected to emphasize his support for controlled immigration policies, expressing a desire to end the free movement of eu citizens while retaining a "pro-immigration" stance.
he will paint a "positive" picture of the country post-brexit, stating that leaving the eu provides an opportunity for the nation to uphold its values and regain confidence in itself.
it has been asserted by close associates that mr johnson and mr gove share unwavering unity and that there are no divisions between them.
despite a leaked email attributed to mrs.
gove, it has been clarified that it reflects her personal views rather than mr.
shortly after mr johnson’s announcement, theresa may, the home secretary, will kick off her own conservative leadership campaign, focusing on building a nation that benefits all citizens.
advocating for a brexit-inclusive government, mrs.
may plans to woo eurosceptics by unveiling a new department dedicated to managing the uk's negotiations with the eu.
following the leak of the manchester suicide bomber's identity to the american media, britain's home secretary, amber rudd, expressed her frustration to her us counterpart.
rudd publicly addressed the uk government's concerns about the breach on wednesday, while investigators continued their efforts to uncover potential accomplices of 22-year-old salman abedi.
in manchester, three individuals were taken into custody in the southern part of the city, adding to the arrest of a 23-year-old male linked to the attack.
us officials, as reported by american media outlets, identified the detained individual as abedi's brother.
unlike the british press, which refrained from disclosing the attacker's name in efforts to safeguard the investigation and prevent alerting additional suspects, us networks cbs and nbc revealed the perpetrator's identity on tuesday, hours prior to confirmation by the greater manchester police, echoing a similar incident during the westminster attack in april.

the art of performing magic tricks, such as pulling a rabbit out of a hat or similar illusions, has captivated children for generations.
despite this, the future of live magic performances faces a concerning threat due to the increasing popularity of youtube magicians.
a prominent member of the magic circle, jamie raven, has cautioned that the surge in online magic videos risks diminishing crucial skills essential for the survival of live magic in the future.
raven, a respected member of the inner magic circle, highlighted that many amateur magicians are now honing their craft solely for the camera, focusing on perfecting tricks for online audiences seeking validation through likes.
while platforms like youtube and social media may stimulate an interest in magic, raven raised alarm that fundamental abilities such as engaging with real audiences to control or redirect their attention are gradually fading away.
he expressed apprehension that if the current trend of prioritizing online presence persists, future generations may witness the extinction of traditional magic shows and the rich interactive experiences they offer.
roberto martinez, the former manager of everton, wigan, and swansea, has officially been named as the new head coach of belgium.
the 43-year-old spaniard takes over from marc wilmots, who vacated the position following belgium's defeat in the euro 2016 quarter-finals.
martinez's appointment came shortly after his departure from everton in may.
his coaching style, described as a blend of tactical prowess and effective communication, aligns with the belgian football association's criteria for the role as they sought a coach with a proven track record of guiding top players.
the bbc's gary lineker shared his thoughts on martinez's new position via twitter, while the belgian fa expressed their satisfaction in swiftly securing a coach of martinez's caliber.
notably, during his tenure at everton, martinez had managed prominent belgian internationals such as marouane fellaini, romelu lukaku, and kevin mirallas.
martinez is set to hold a press conference on thursday at 11:30 bst, with his debut match as belgium's head coach scheduled against spain on 1 september.
a private therapeutic day school catering to students in grades 6-12 is set to relocate from niles to arlington heights.
new hope academy, to be housed in an office building at 3250 n.
arlington heights road, just south of dundee road, will make the move before the commencement of the 2017-18 school year in august.
brandy larrance, the school's executive director, confirmed the move.
established in 2000, the school serves students with special needs from 35 suburban school districts, encompassing northwest suburban high school district 214, palatine-schaumburg high school district 211, as well as districts in gurnee, naperville, and yorkville.
currently, there are 65 students enrolled at the school's current location at 6289 howard st.
in niles, with plans to increase enrollment to 80 with the relocation to arlington heights.
new hope academy is set to occupy 18,000 square feet within the 73,000-square-foot, multi-tenant office building, which is predominantly vacant.
the school's facilities in the new location will consist of 12 classrooms, an art studio, gym, cafeteria, staff lounge, and offices.
recently, the village board granted approval for a land use variation to facilitate the move.
new hope academy intends to enhance the landscaping surrounding the property prior to moving in.
visa europe has initiated the suspension of payments to the whistle-blowing platform wikileaks as part of an upcoming investigation into the organization.
this decision mirrors a similar action taken by mastercard recently.
the development comes in the wake of wikileaks' founder julian assange's arrest by london police.
assange faces sexual assault charges in sweden.
the website's reliance on financial contributions via visa and mastercard debit and credit cards will be impacted.
a visa europe spokesperson explained that the investigation aims to assess the nature of wikileaks' business and its compliance with visa's regulations.
the suspension process is not immediate and requires a certain timeframe.
mastercard has also announced its intention to halt card transactions on wikileaks until the matter is resolved.
other entities, such as paypal and amazon, have severed ties with wikileaks in recent days.
new polling data from marist college, nbc news, and the wall street journal reveals that president obama has seen a notable increase in support in three crucial swing states.
the latest polls by marist indicate that obama is leading mitt romney by five points in both florida and virginia, and by seven points in ohio.
this lead is larger than that shown in previous polls and suggests that the democratic national convention has had a positive impact on obama's campaign in these key battleground states.
recent national polls have also indicated a slight but significant bounce in support for obama following the convention.
with limited post-convention polling data available from swing states, these latest results showing obama leading with 50% to 43% in ohio and 49% to 44% in both florida and virginia are particularly important.
should obama secure victory in just two of these major swing states, it would substantially complicate romney's path to winning the election.
these states collectively hold 60 out of the 95 electoral votes from the eight states deemed as toss-ups.
an analysis by the fix on wednesday suggests that if the rest of the states vote as anticipated, obama would only need to secure 33 of those 95 electoral votes to secure his re-election.
television personality sonia kruger has acknowledged that her recent statement calling for an end to muslim immigration in australia might be considered extreme.
despite the backlash her comments received, kruger defended her right to express her opinion, which had sparked a heated national debate.
in her first public response since making the controversial remarks, kruger, emotional but resolute, stood by her position during the broadcast of channel nine's today extra program on tuesday.
the former host of dancing with the stars emphasized her utmost respect for individuals of all races and religions, yet she elaborated on her feelings following the tragic events in nice, france, where 84 people lost their lives and many were injured after a truck plowed through a crowd on bastille day.
renowned author ed klein, a former new york times magazine editor, has joined forces with republican frontrunner donald trump on the campaign trail in indiana.
confirming his presence with trump to the washington examiner, klein shared that they are making their way across the state in anticipation of a crucial primary showdown against rival ted cruz.
klein stated, "we're on the move from one location to another," while refraining from disclosing the specific reasons for his involvement with trump.
despite being pressed for details, klein cited ongoing commitments preventing him from elaborating further: "i'm currently engaged with a pressing matter and unable to discuss it today or in the near future," he revealed.
klein is most notably recognized for his controversial book "unlikable: the problem with hillary," which offers an inside look into democratic candidate hillary clinton's ambitious journey towards the presidency.
the book portrays clinton as a power-driven figure lacking the essential charm and appeal required for the white house role.
klein's in-depth analysis highlighted clinton's alleged health issues, raising concerns about her suitability for the presidency.
in a recent column for newsmax, klein disclosed his long-standing relationship with trump, emphasizing his extensive interactions with the candidate over the past three and a half decades.
praising trump's strategic advantage in the gop race, klein previously supported marco rubio as a strong contender against clinton in the general election, suggesting john kasich as a potential running mate for rubio.
despite efforts to reach out to the trump campaign for comment, there was no response at the time of reporting.
interest in power forward glen davis is intensifying as nba teams gear up to make enticing offers to secure the talented player before the postseason.
despite the los angeles clippers initially being favored to sign him, the magic's recent release of davis has opened up the field.
the brooklyn nets are emerging as a strong contender, hoping to leverage kevin garnett's past connection with davis.
additionally, reports from espn's marc stein suggest that the miami heat are now considering making a move for him.
while davis cannot officially join a team until he clears waivers and becomes a free agent on monday, sources close to the situation anticipate a decision from him before the weekend concludes.
in a whirlwind week marked by the antics of a deceptive racial manipulator and a tragic event at a black church, today stands as the 150th anniversary of juneteenth, commemorating the emancipation of the last american slaves.
this milestone arrives at a time when achieving a post-racial society feels increasingly distant.
the current occupant of the white house, the first african american to reside there, known for his caution regarding race-related issues, has an opportunity to make a significant gesture by acknowledging the dark history of the united states as the world's largest slaveholding nation.
the persistent presence of the confederate flag at the south carolina statehouse, where the civil war began, serves as a stark reminder of the deep-seated hatred that prevails from days of legalized slavery.
while an apology cannot erase this hatred, it has the potential to set off positive ripples that could resonate for years to come.

a few years back, a group of friends and i embarked on a road trip from the east coast to the southwest, spending approximately two weeks exploring the mexican border in the state of chihuahua, primarily in ciudad juarez.
it was during this trip that i was introduced to horchata- a delightful blend of creaminess, sweetness, and refreshment, particularly welcome in the scorching summer climate.
ever since that memorable experience, i have attempted to recreate it using various powders and boxed rice milks without success, until i chanced upon a recipe that instantly transported me back to juarez.
this recipe is believed to be highly authentic, incorporating evaporated milk for an indulgently creamy texture.
i assure you, your loved ones will be astounded by the results!
the ingredients required for this recipe are readily available and cost-effective.
one essential item you will need is a cheesecloth, typically found in the baking section of most supermarkets.
for those avoiding dairy, the horchata can still be enjoyed without the evaporated milk; simply adjust the sugar content to approximately 1 cup, or to suit your preference.
sri lanka cricket fast-bowling coach, anusha samaranayake, who was suspended in february due to fixing allegations, has now been cleared of any wrongdoing.
slc conducted an inquiry into samaranayake's involvement in a fixing-related approach by sri lanka cricketers the previous year.
the icc has communicated to slc that there is no evidence to suggest samaranayake violated its anti-corruption code.
despite this exoneration, samaranayake's role with slc remains uncertain as he has been involved in a separate disciplinary issue for entertaining guests at slc's academy in khettarama.
although samaranayake's contract with slc is valid until the end of december and has not been terminated, his return to coaching duties is in question as the slc secretary mohan de silva stated.
samaranayake has played a pivotal role in the development of numerous sri lanka fast bowlers, with players like lasith malinga and nuwan kulasekara crediting him for their success.
slc has mentioned that a final decision about samaranayake's future will be made in the upcoming weeks.
on saturday night, a plane landed in montreal with the 25,000th syrian refugee arriving in canada since november.
this marks the completion of the initial phase of the resettlement program initiated by the liberal government shortly after assuming office.
the event was not widely celebrated at the time, but immigration minister john mccallum is set to provide an update on the program in toronto on monday, detailing the future steps of the program.
government officials from citizenship and immigration canada had been expecting to reach this milestone over the weekend, despite the uncertainty of the exact timing due to varying refugee numbers per flight.
achieving the 25,000-refugee target is a significant accomplishment for the liberal government, fulfilling an election promise to resettle individuals fleeing the syrian civil war.
initially aiming to achieve this goal by the end of 2015, the deadline was extended to the end of february after the government came into power.
of the 25,000 newcomers, over half will have their expenses covered by the government in the first year, while the rest will receive support from private organizations or a combination of both.
in the following days, the new arrivals will disperse across eight provinces, joining those who have been resettled in canada since the launch of the syrian refugee plan in november.
square enix's long-awaited remake of final fantasy x has finally resurfaced at a japan-centric vita heaven event, marking its first appearance in over a year.
originally unveiled at tgs in 2011, final fantasy x hd had been kept under wraps until now.
while no official release date was announced during the event, attendees were treated to a brief glimpse of the game in action, showcasing updated character models.
famitsu was quick to capture screenshots of final fantasy x hd in motion.
the event also featured a plethora of monster hunter-inspired games exclusive to japan for the struggling handheld, along with the highly anticipated side-scrolling rpg dragon's crown by vanillaware.
notably, the event also revealed a price cut for the playstation vita set to go into effect at the end of the month.
fans are now eagerly anticipating whether similar announcements will be made at the upcoming playstation meeting in new york this wednesday.
apple's impressive growth in mac sales despite a declining pc market has been well highlighted.
alongside apple, lenovo has also thrived in the desktop and laptop arena as evidenced by its substantial revenue and profit increases.
lenovo recently announced that its pc shipments in the us surpassed apple's for the first time, securing the third position after leading giants hp and dell.
this claim is substantiated by recent data, likely supported by idc analysts, although gartner had previously ranked lenovo fourth in the us as of april.
regardless of differing opinions, lenovo has dominated the global pc market for approximately a year, driven by the continuous expansion of its thinkpad lineup.
moreover, lenovo has seen growth in non-windows tablet and smartphone sales, a trend expected to strengthen further in the us following its acquisition of motorola.
achieving a consistent 90 fps in vr poses a considerable challenge, but this presentation introduces a novel approach to dynamically adjusting graphics quality to ensure vr framerate remains stable without resorting to reprojection techniques.
this method is effective even on low-end gpus, while still offering the flexibility to enhance rendering quality on high-end gpus and multi-gpu setups.
for instance, valve's aperture robot repair vr demo at gdc 2015 necessitated an nvidia 980 for consistent framerate, whereas this discussion will showcase how the same experience can now maintain 90 fps on an nvidia 680, an aging gpu model.
the outcome is an engine that sustains a heightened level of fidelity, a reduced gpu minimum specification, expanded capabilities for art assets, and a framework that empowers developers to shift their focus from fps optimization to enhancing renderer quality and performance, all the while ensuring framerate stability.
amazon's drive to secure better bargains and lower costs has led to increased pressure on publishers, extending beyond just books.
according to the new york times, amazon is now declining to list pre-orders for dvd and blu-ray versions of several warner home video movies scheduled for release.
noteworthy titles such as the lego movie, 300: rise of an empire, and winter's tale are among those affected, with amazon displaying them for viewing but not allowing customers to make orders.
this move follows a recent revelation by the company that it was restricting orders for new hachette books, including the awaited release of jk rowling's the silkworm, as part of its efforts to negotiate better pricing for e-books.
the situation has now reached a standstill with suppliers who are resisting amazon's demands, creating a risky impasse that is already prompting some amazon patrons to seek their purchases from alternative sources.
juan agudelo may potentially join celtic following a successful trial.
the chivas usa player joined celtic for a training stint in november with hopes of moving to a european club during the mls close season.
at just 20 years old, he is considered one of america's top young talents, attracting interest from various european clubs.
celtic, impressed by agudelo during his trial with neil lennon and his coaching team, are eager to secure his signature to strengthen their attacking options in the current transfer window.
an offer has been made to chivas to acquire the talented colombian-born forward for celtic park.
i still vividly recall the initial moment i witnessed someone engrossed in a handheld electronic game.
seated alone on a bench in front of my school, they held a magical box from which enchanting sounds emanated.
engaged in playing electronic quarterback from coleco, i found myself captivated by the scene.
as more onlookers gathered, we stood in awe of this innovative electronic phenomenon.
it's likely that every passing child excitedly informed their parents about this groundbreaking game.
rushing home, i meticulously scanned through catalogs to ensure the game's correct name for my upcoming birthday list.
in the end, i ended up with a mattel electronic game instead, content with the substitution.
recognizing the higher price tag of the coleco version from my catalog search, i was simply grateful to receive any electronic game.
teifi, a vegetarian, unpasteurized cheese hailing from wales, is organically crafted by the caws teifi cheese company founded by john and patrice savage-ontswedder.
reminiscent of gouda, this semi-hard cheese boasts a vibrant sunshine-yellow interior.
teifi comes in various iterations, distinguished by its aging process.
in its youth, it offers a gentle, slightly sweet taste with a velvety, creamy consistency.
with age, teifi transforms into a robust, flaky cheese akin to parmesan, maturing over a span of two to nine months.
infused with ingredients like nettles, seaweed, garlic, onion, sweet pepper, and cumin, each variety imparts a unique flavor profile.
a smoked version of teifi is also available.
when melted, teifi takes on a stringy texture, making it a delectable addition when used for heating, toasting, or topping pizzas.
the islamic state has recently issued a detailed and brutal directive urging its "lone wolf" followers to carry out attacks on australian iconic locations like bondi beach and the mcg through methods such as stabbing, shooting, poisoning, and vehicular attacks.

during a meeting between yun and li in beijing, li emphasized china's enduring commitment to maintaining peace and stability on the korean peninsula.
the chinese premier, li keqiang, conveyed to south korean foreign minister yun byung-se that beijing will not tolerate north korea's possession of nuclear weapons, as confirmed by a diplomatic source.
on the same day, senior chinese official wang jiarui expressed newfound support for south korea's proposal to hold discussions involving seoul, beijing, washington, and north korea to alleviate tensions in the region, a stance previously unendorsed by china.
wang advocated for the inclusion of north korea in these talks.
yun informed wang that seoul could not agree to north korea's prerequisites for disarmament negotiations that would omit the topic of denuclearization.
additionally, south korea and china agreed to establish a direct diplomatic hotline between their respective foreign ministers.
this weekend, the san francisco 49ers have a significant lineup of pre-draft visits, as reported by nfl network reporter ian rapoport.
in a recent tweet, he mentioned that ucla linebacker myles jack is scheduled to have a meeting with the 49ers management in santa clara.
despite being linked to jack in various mock drafts, the main correspondence between the 49ers and him this offseason was when linebackers coach jason tarver conducted a training session with the ucla linebackers.
jack is currently in the final stages of recovery from a torn meniscus he sustained in late september, causing him to miss the remainder of the season.
his 40-yard dash performance has yet to be evaluated, which might be a topic of discussion during the upcoming meeting.
jack has been previously cleared by his ucla surgeon.
while the 49ers' need for an inside linebacker may not be considered urgent, considering gerald hodges and michael wilhoite as suitable options alongside navorro bowman, if jack happens to be available at no.
7, he could potentially be the top player on the board.
the likelihood of jack slipping in the draft depends on whether both jared goff and carson wentz are selected within the top six picks, which would reduce the availability of quality defensive prospects.
although it is anticipated that jack might be drafted earlier, the unpredictability of the top six picks leaves room for surprises.
after making a heartfelt plea for a kidney donation on craigslist, a woman, selina hodge, has successfully undergone a transplant surgery at a miami hospital.
she resorted to posting her request online in july, receiving an overwhelming response of over 800 offers from around the globe.
among those, 23-year-old stephanie grant from palm beach gardens stepped forward to donate.
following several evaluations at the university of miami medical centre campus, the transplant surgery took place, with both women reportedly recovering well post-operation, according to their families speaking to a florida television station, wptv.
let's steer away from ron vlaar and the ongoing manchester united rumors for a moment and shift our focus to adnan januzaj.
the promising young talent from the red devils appears poised to head out on loan during this current transfer window, with aston villa showing interest in acquiring him.
januzaj, who is seen as having a promising future at old trafford following his promotion to the first team under david moyes, is also reportedly on the radar of his former manager at real sociedad.
despite his limited involvement in louis van gaal's plans, the prevailing notion is to send him on loan to gain valuable experience.
however, for villa to secure januzaj on loan, they would first need to ensure that tom cleverley's deal becomes permanent in january since premier league regulations permit clubs to loan only one player from another club at a time.
a permanent deal for cleverley in january seems unlikely given his contract status with manchester united expiring in the summer.
could villa emerge as the ideal destination for januzaj, and would he bring added value to paul lambert's squad?
over the weekend, the city experienced a series of violent incidents as cleveland police responded to six reported shootings.
among these incidents, a 15-year-old boy was shot in the leg on hopkins avenue in the 11000 block and was subsequently transported to rainbow babies and children's hospital for medical care.
additionally, a 39-year-old woman sustained a gunshot wound to her buttocks on east 117th street in the 2900 block and was taken to university hospitals for treatment.
another shooting incident occurred on sunday where a 28-year-old woman was critically injured with a gunshot wound to her leg on crennell avenue in the 13000 block, and she was rushed to university hospitals by ems.
further reports from cleveland police detailed two separate felonious assault shootings on saturday - one involving a man who suffered a head injury on way avenue in the 10000 block, and the other where a 28-year-old man was shot in the arm at the intersection of east 120th street and euclid avenue.
additionally, an 18-year-old man was also shot in the ear and leg at lee road and judson drive based on police reports.
former rolling stone executive editor eric bates will be a key addition to the upcoming media organization founded by ebay creator pierre omidyar and journalist glenn greenwald.
omidyar referred to the venture as "newco" in a recent online update, where he stated that bates will play a vital role in shaping the editorial direction for a broad readership and establishing the necessary editing framework to support the team of independent journalists.
with nearly a decade of experience at rolling stone, bates specialized in editing notable pieces on politics and national security, including the acclaimed 2010 feature on gen.
stanley mcchrystal penned by the late michael hastings, titled "the runaway general." bates also notably conducted four interviews with president obama during his tenure at rolling stone.
after leaving rolling stone earlier this year due to staff changes, bates held roles such as investigative editor at mother jones and editor-in-chief of southern exposure.
recently, bates transitioned into a scholar position at nyu's institute for public knowledge and was a finalist for the top editor position at the columbia journalism review.
the collaboration between omidyar, greenwald, laura poitras, and jeremy scahill sparked interest last month, but details regarding the media outlet's structure were still being finalized.
omidyar mentioned in an interview with huffpost that the organization plans to recruit seasoned editors and distinguished writers dedicated to their respective areas of expertise.
engaging students in the wonders of science is made enjoyable when incorporating pflumm's book series into the curriculum.
to enhance the science program, 34 copies of "agnes pflumm and the stone creek science fair" are needed.
the diverse backgrounds of my students, many from inner-city homes in our title i school, make it crucial to make science both educational and enjoyable.

friedrich nietzsche, the renowned philosopher of the 19th century, stood out as a brilliant yet controversial figure.
his unyielding and often harsh concepts shattered the conventional beliefs in religion, morality, and science.
in his world, devoid not only of god but also of much of what defines humanity, the starkness and innovation of his post-religious views were striking.
bettany hughes delves into the convictions of a man whose philosophical work has been widely misconstrued and manipulated.
nietzche's aversion to structured systems and a quest for absolute truths rendered his ideas enigmatic and at times inconsistent.
this ambiguity made room for varying interpretations, allowing his ideologies, which cautioned against totalitarian political systems, to be distorted to serve such ends.
despite his vocal stance against anti-semitism, his efforts were tarnished by the actions of his anti-semitic sister, who portrayed him as a champion of hitler's aryan agenda.
opposing nationalism, he unwittingly became associated with a regime he would have detested.
while nietzsche's philosophical journey led him to isolation and ultimately madness, his concepts significantly influenced the modern intellectual paradigm.
the first high-resolution climate modelling for the future predicts that sydney and the wider region of nsw will experience more hot days, changing rainfall patterns, and heightened fire risks due to global warming.
collaborative efforts between the nsw and act governments and researchers at the university of nsw's climate change research centre have developed scenarios for grids measuring 100 square kilometers up to 2030 and 2070 across eastern australia, spanning from south-east queensland to the eastern half of south australia.
the updated models show an increase in extreme fire weather days during spring and summer throughout most parts of the state.
previous models erroneously equated sydney's climate with more inland towns like bathurst, but the new findings confirm that temperatures will rise across nsw.
as stated by matthew riley, director of climate and atmospheric science at the office of environment and heritage, there will be a decrease in cold days, particularly along the great dividing range.
hearts conducted an interview with former captain steven pressley yesterday in their quest for a new head coach.
the 43-year-old had a meeting with ann budge, the owner of the edinburgh club, and director of football craig levein.
pressley is among the initial candidates to formally be interviewed for the position left vacant after hearts dismissed ian cathro last week.
in the upcoming days, other candidates will also be approached, including former england manager steve mcclaren, who is on the shortlist as a potential replacement for cathro.
this interview marks a year since pressley's last managerial role at english league one club fleetwood town.
despite previously expressing disinterest in returning to scotland to manage, the opportunity to lead hearts has sparked a reconsideration.
pressley has a strong history with the club, having spent eight years at tynecastle as a player and captained them to scottish cup success in 2006.
his managerial experience includes stints at falkirk, coventry city, and fleetwood.
notably, he recently contributed to the strachan football foundation, established by scotland manager gordon strachan.
while hearts are not under immediate pressure to make a decision, jon daly will remain as interim coach for the upcoming match against kilmarnock at rugby park.
a permanent appointment is expected before the subsequent game against rangers, allowing the tynecastle hierarchy ample time to deliberate on the ideal candidate to lead the team forward.
at least 21 individuals are feared to have lost their lives in the wake of a chemical plant blast that took place in hubei province, china.
reports surfaced this afternoon about an explosion at the location, resulting in five individuals being injured in addition to the unfortunate fatalities.
a photograph captured at the scene in dangyang depicts firefighters battling intense flames at the chemical plant.
the incident transpired following the rupture of a high-pressure steam tube, as confirmed by authorities.
among the five wounded, three are reported to be in critical condition.
this grim incident has stirred memories of a parallel occurrence last year, when another chemical plant explosion shook zhejiang province.
just earlier this year, in january, another explosion was witnessed in the south-central chinese city of lengshuijiang.
the distressing development has been officially acknowledged by cctv, china's state broadcaster.
the instagram app on android has crossed the milestone of 500 million installations, a feat achieved by only a select few on the play store.
among these, the majority are from google, while facebook now boasts its third entry with instagram following facebook messenger, which hit this mark in august last year.
the flagship facebook app, in the subsequent month, reached over double that figure.
apart from google and facebook, just two other companies have gained entry into this exclusive circle, one being microsoft with skype, and the other unexpected member being samsung, thanks to its push service.
despite facebook's prominent presence, instagram’s popularity has remained unabated since its acquisition.
the ongoing question is whether the rapid growth of the service will eventually plateau in the future.

to complete the assembly, tighten the top nuts on all screws to firmly attach the legs to the grill.
returning to full training after a hamstring injury sustained while on national team duty in august, liverpool striker daniel sturridge is back on the field.
the team struggled in his absence, winning only four out of 14 matches.
sturridge, who impressively scored 21 goals in 29 league games last season, was close to a comeback before a calf strain setback last month.
liverpool manager brendan rodgers anticipates sturridge's availability for the upcoming match against crystal palace on november 23.
despite being criticized by rodgers for his handling by the english national team after initially being ruled out for three weeks, sturridge has featured in only three premier league games this season, scoring in a home game against southampton.
with liverpool sitting in 11th place in the premier league table, 15 points adrift of leaders chelsea, they are also struggling in the champions league following three consecutive defeats in group b matches.
for those who are new to their gym routine, it's common to feel hesitant about venturing into the weight room.
whether your goal is weight loss or toning up, incorporating weight training into your exercise regimen is highly beneficial.
however, for beginners, it can be intimidating not knowing where to begin.
fortunately, anna renderer, a popsugar fitness host and personal trainer, has devised a beginner-friendly dumbbell circuit workout to alleviate any apprehensions.
anna recommends performing two consecutive moves to really feel the workout's intensity.
the circuit consists of completing the first move 10 times to finish one set, then repeating the second move 10 times to complete another set.
alternate between the two until you've done three sets of each.
repeat this process for the subsequent circuits as well.
terry joseph, who had been coaching the tennessee defensive backs and also operating as the vols' recruiting coordinator for the past two seasons, has accepted a position on the nebraska staff.
joseph conveyed his decision to tennessee coach derek dooley on friday.
he had previously worked alongside dooley at louisiana tech before joining him at tennessee.
with joseph's departure, the vols will see a complete overhaul of their defensive staff for the upcoming season.
he becomes the seventh assistant coach to exit tennessee's staff since the conclusion of the 2011 season.
sal sunseri has stepped in as the vols' new defensive coordinator following his move from alabama.
derrick ansley, who previously served as a graduate assistant at alabama and was involved with the crimson tide's secondary, was appointed in february to coach the vols' cornerbacks.
john palermo takes on the role of the vols' new defensive line coach after spending the last two seasons at middle tennessee.
palermo also brings experience from coaching with the washington redskins and spending 15 years on the coaching staff at wisconsin.
dooley mentioned last month that he felt the program had received a boost from the influx of new coaching personnel.
the only two coaches remaining from the original staff are offensive coordinator jim chaney and receivers coach darin hinshaw, who is transitioning to coaching receivers after guiding the vols' quarterbacks for the past two seasons.
the south korean ambassador to india emphasized the need to monitor the growing influence of china and highlighted the escalating arms race in east asia as a potential area of concern.
he pointed out that with china significantly increasing its defense budget by 750% over the past two decades, there is a risk of it establishing regional dominance.
speaking at an event in new delhi titled 'india and korea: new prospects for bilateral co-operation', the ambassador advocated for a strategic partnership between india and south korea, citing common cultural, political, and economic values.
he suggested that leveraging india's strengths in defense, space research, and airpower along with korea's robust shipping industry could yield mutual benefits.
additionally, he stressed the importance of collaboration between india and south korea in nuclear energy and maritime security, as well as the need for enhanced cooperation among regional countries in light of india's growing influence in saarc and its 'look east policy'.
the ambassador underlined the significance of aligning regional wisdom and fostering unity to counter dominant forces.

sources indicate that the san francisco 49ers plan to bring in another rookie quarterback, jeremiah masoli, who previously played for ole miss rebel and oregon ducks.
masoli, a san francisco native, began his college career at city college of san francisco and later transferred to oregon.
during his time at oregon in 2009, he showcased his skills by amassing a total of 2,815 yards of offense and 28 touchdowns.
however, masoli's career faced setbacks due to off-field issues, including a guilty plea for burglary and subsequent suspensions.
despite his talents, which include athleticism rather than refined passing abilities, masoli's future with the 49ers may hinge on his performance in training camp.
while he may be destined for the practice squad at best, the team might explore the option of transitioning him to a different position.

the fourth of july fireworks display in washington, d.c. wasn't as spectacular this year due to fog and rain obscuring the sky over the national mall, disappointing spectators who had gathered to watch.
however, viewers who watched the event on pbs or on their phones on monday might have noticed a crystal-clear sky with flawless fireworks.
some even questioned if the scaffolding that had been on the capitol dome for the past two years had disappeared.
despite the seamless presentation, sharp-eyed observers detected inconsistencies, and pbs eventually acknowledged that they had mixed in pre-recorded firework displays from previous years with live footage.
israeli police reported that a 14-year-old boy, who had allegedly been confined at home by his parents since birth in israel, has been rescued and placed under protective care.
according to army radio, the boy revealed to the authorities that he was occasionally taken outside to the building's courtyard in hadera once or twice a month, primarily during nighttime, and at times, he was kept in an improvised cage outside their residence.
the parents, who have been apprehended, claimed they were motivated by concerns for their son's health.
numerous neighbors had raised complaints with the local authorities about the unpleasant odors emanating from the dwelling.
one hadera resident informed the army radio that upon witnessing the boy's distressing situation resembling a character from a horror movie, he felt compelled to act.
he recounted seeing the child looking helpless through a window, conveying a silent plea for assistance.
the parents, believed to be approximately 60 years old and originally from russia, relocated to a town north of tel aviv in 2009 without disclosing the existence of their son to municipal authorities or enrolling him in school.
as per reports, a lawyer representing the mother stated to the media that their actions were driven by a desire to safeguard the well-being of their child, who supposedly had health issues.
the study focuses on the firsthand experiences of human rights defenders within the training setting and post-training.
initially, it was designed to investigate the significant factors that impact the adoption of digital security practices by human rights defenders, aiming to enhance the sustainability of training efforts.
this initiative was prompted by a growing concern within the training community regarding the waning utilization of tools and digital security measures by participants following training sessions or their failure to fully incorporate these practices into their daily routines.
while numerous hypotheses existed to explain this phenomenon, a more in-depth analysis was deemed necessary.
the images featured on this platform were devised as part of an interactive exercise conducted during the security in context study, where human rights defenders and advocates depicted their perceptions of the internet through drawing.
upon assuming the role of the new head coach of the united states men's national team, bruce arena has swiftly begun assembling his staff.
as reported by grant wahl of sports illustrated, arena intends to retain most of his staff from the los angeles galaxy, including assistant coaches matt reis and pat noonan, both of whom are former players for the new england revolution.
additionally, arena's son kenny arena is expected to join him on the usmnt bench.
reis, the record-holder for every goalkeeping statistic at new england, transitioned to coaching with the la galaxy in 2014 following his retirement as a player to be closer to his family.
with two caps as a player for the usmnt, reis was the third goalkeeper on the victorious 2005 gold cup team.
noonan, who amassed over 100 appearances for the revolution and scored 37 goals during his five-season tenure, also made the move to the galaxy after concluding his mls career in 2012.
having represented the usmnt in 15 matches and scoring a goal, noonan was part of the 2005 gold cup championship squad.
wahl also hinted at the possibility of tab ramos continuing as the usa's under-20 coach and youth technical director, making for an exciting prospect for these esteemed former players in the coaching setup.

it has been a widely held belief that human brain evolution led to the enlargement of the frontal lobes; however, our research challenges this assumption.
by analyzing five distinct data sets using correctly scaled measures and phylogenetic methods, we have found that the size of human frontal lobes and specific frontal regions is in line with the size of other brain structures.
claims of relative enlargement of human frontal white matter volume and similarities across all great apes appear to be inaccurate.
our study also indicates that the rate of change in relative frontal cortex volume in the human evolutionary branch was not exceptional, with other branches exhibiting significantly faster rates of change.
while absolute and proportional frontal region size did increase rapidly in humans, this growth was closely linked to corresponding size increases in other brain areas and whole brain size, alongside decreases in frontal neuron densities.
therefore, investigations into the neural basis of human cognitive distinctiveness should shift focus from the frontal lobes in isolation to consider distributed neural networks.
with the increasing adoption of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies worldwide, there is a push in europe to establish itself as a leading financial center for digital currency businesses.
however, to ensure consumer confidence and legal protection for firms, it is essential to introduce more regulatory measures.
despite concerns from some bitcoin enthusiasts that regulation may undermine the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, collaborating with regulators is seen by many as a way to foster adoption while preserving innovation.
the european banking federation, representing major banks across the continent, has proposed a framework for cryptocurrency regulations, emphasizing the importance of cooperation between digital currency firms and government entities to develop flexible rules that can evolve alongside the industry.
they suggest building upon existing anti-money laundering regulations as a basis for new laws while emphasizing the need for continuous assessment and updates to reflect the dynamic nature of the sector.
additionally, the report highlights the growing interest of financial institutions in blockchain technology and its potential to transform various financial processes, such as cross-border payments and contract agreements.
encouraging such advancements is seen as crucial by the ebf to support the development of the blockchain ecosystem.

new images obtained from nasa's earth observatory have revealed the ongoing decline of the aral sea, marking the devastating aftermath of the soviet-era decision to redirect the lake's tributaries for agricultural purposes.
this catastrophe has resulted in the escalation of salinity levels and chemical pollution, exacerbating the environmental crisis.
once recognized as the world's fourth-largest lake, the aral sea now stands as a colossal toxic wasteland straddling kazakhstan and uzbekistan, former soviet territories in central asia.
these recent satellite images exhibit the alarming retreat of the lake's waters over the past 14 years, culminating in the complete desiccation of the eastern portion of the south aral sea, formerly the lake's central body.
prior to the 1960s, the aral sea thrived due to inflows from the amu darya and syr darya rivers, sourced from mountain snowmelt and local precipitation.
however, the soviet union's diversion of these vital water sources for agricultural irrigation initiated the lake's demise, triggering a decline in water levels and an uptick in salinity.
additionally, the use of fertilizers and chemicals only intensified the environmental degradation, contaminating the exposed lakebed and leading to soil dispersion onto nearby farmlands.
consequently, this escalation in water depletion caused drastic shifts in the local climate, as evidenced by harsher winters and sweltering summers attributed to the absence of the moderating influence of the once-massive body of water, as outlined in a recent report from the earth observatory.
rita's italian ice is currently making temporary adjustments by replacing frozen custard with soft-serve ice cream due to a national egg shortage caused by the severe avian flu outbreak across the country, affecting more than 600 franchise locations, including those in central pennsylvania.
the shortage of eggs is a consequence of the avian flu epidemic that has significantly impacted egg-producing poultry, particularly in the midwest, resulting in escalated egg prices.
since december 2014, over 48 million birds, predominantly chickens and turkeys, have been affected.
as a result of the egg scarcity and rising costs, eateries nationwide are feeling the strain, with some increasing breakfast menu prices.
in response to the shortage, texas-based whataburger has adjusted its breakfast hours.
rita's spokesperson ariel vegotsky expressed that the chain has never encountered such a significant national food shortage before.
vegotsky explained that rita's has been unable to acquire sufficient egg supplies to meet the demand of its 600 stores.
while certain locations have already made the switch to soft-serve, others are in the process of depleting their custard stockpiles.
ultimately, all rita's locations will be serving soft-serve temporarily.
vegotsky emphasized that the chain plans to reintroduce custard eventually.
fortunately, customers have been accepting of the change, with vegotsky noting positive feedback regarding the alternative soft-serve product, which she assures is a close match in taste to the custard.
the story has been revised to provide additional details about the avian flu outbreak.
a collective of doctors and health experts have strongly criticized australia's recent prohibition on the utilization of nicotine in electronic cigarettes, referring to it as both "flawed and unethical." the decision by the therapeutic goods administration to maintain the ban was based on research indicating that the use of e-cigarettes could lead to nicotine dependency and potentially encourage teenage tobacco consumption.
despite efforts by a coalition of 16 medical professionals, scholars, and public health activists to challenge the ban by emphasizing the potential benefits of e-cigarettes as smoking cessation aids, the tga has stood by its policy to prohibit the inclusion of nicotine in electronic cigarettes.
the group argued in a formal letter to the tga last february that it is both unscientific and morally questionable to exclude nicotine from tobacco products while denying smokers access to a less harmful alternative.

athletics australia announced that they would not be considering nominating steeplechaser genevieve lacaze for the upcoming london games, despite her meeting the qualifying time for her event just 24 hours after the official deadline.
in a statement released on the matter, aa expressed that extending the qualification period to accommodate lacaze's late qualification would be deemed unfair to other athletes who adhered to the set timeline.

in argentina, a judge has intervened to prevent the marriage between a 22-year-old woman, edith casas, and victor cingolani, who is serving a 13-year prison sentence for the murder of edith's twin sister, johana.
despite the conviction, edith maintains cingolani's innocence, asserting that he did not kill her sister with whom he had a romantic involvement.
concerns about edith's mental state were raised by her mother, marcelina orellana, who deemed her daughter to be "psychologically ill" and sought legal action to halt the impending wedding.
it was noted that edith's behavior had drastically changed recently, moving out of her parental home to live with cingolani's sister and announcing their wedding plans.
the couple had aimed to marry discreetly at the prison where cingolani is incarcerated, but the judge postponed the ceremony pending a final decision by december 31.
cingolani has stated that he was in love with edith and portrayed his association with johana as casual.

reports have emerged of a clash between skateboarders and police in san francisco during an informal "hill bombing" competition.
video footage captured a skateboarder colliding with an officer, causing the skateboarder to be propelled into a police car.
despite skateboarders hurling bottles at police in riot gear, no arrests were made according to the la times.
both the skateboarder and the officer involved, along with another skateboarder, were transported to the hospital, as confirmed by a police spokesperson, although their current conditions remain unknown.
the incident unfolded at dolores park in the mission district, drawing a crowd of hundreds as spectators watched skateboarders descend a steep hill.
conflicting reports suggest that emergency services were summoned either due to a skateboarder losing control at high speed or as a response to complaints from residents about the street being taken over by the event.
witnesses claim that the confrontation was instigated when an officer purposefully collided with a skateboarder, inciting outrage among onlookers.
however, a police officer quoted in the san francisco chronicle asserted that the collision was accidental.
lasting over an hour, the standoff resulted in a police vehicle window being shattered and two vehicles being tagged with graffiti.

the arab world united in condemning the senseless violence, with many countries offering their condolences to egypt.
isis later claimed responsibility for the attack, reporting casualties of over 31 individuals and several others injured, along with vehicles being set ablaze.
the coptic community, representing about 10 percent of egypt's 92 million population, has sadly been the target of a series of deadly assaults in recent months as extremist groups like isis continue to strengthen their presence in the sinai region.
on wednesday morning, a heartfelt tribute was paid to a young woman who passed away while serving in the military.
the "military escort team" solemnly led the procession as the casket bearing 23-year-old danyelle luckey arrived at solomon temple missionary baptist church.
hundreds of attendees gathered for her funeral to bid farewell to the pittsburg native who had enlisted in the navy with aspirations of creating a better life for herself and her family.
she had planned to save money to support her young nephew's college education.
as the family made their way to the church, luckey's father was notably dressed in his daughter's military uniform, a poignant gesture honoring her dedication to service.
tragically, luckey lost her life while on duty aboard an aircraft carrier in the philippine sea.
on a fateful day, she fell ill, retired to her bunk to rest, and never recovered.
the navy has reported her passing as a result of cardiac arrest, although investigations are ongoing.
the family has confirmed that an autopsy is underway, and they expect to receive conclusive results within two to three weeks.
to maximize space in your closet, you may find that your spare blanket or winter clothing unnecessarily takes up much room due to extra air trapped within the fabric fibers.
opting to vacuum-seal your items can efficiently remove this excess air, compacting them to their smallest size without causing any damage.
instead of buying costly storage bags designed for this purpose, you can achieve the same results using everyday household items.
begin by neatly folding the clothes, blankets, or other items you wish to store, and place them inside a sturdy trash bag.
arrange the folded items flat at the bottom of the bag with the opening facing upwards.
insert the hose attachment of a vacuum cleaner into the bag, ensuring it's securely closed around the nozzle.
slowly pull the nozzle upwards, leaving a few inches inside the bag, and seal the bag with a rubber band.
connect the hose to the vacuum cleaner and bunch the bag material around the attachment, allowing the vacuum to remove all the air from the bag.
once the bag has shrunk as much as possible, turn off the vacuum and tighten the rubber band.
repeat this process with any additional bags to free up valuable storage space efficiently.
the rms titanic, considered one of the most famous maritime disasters in history, met its tragic fate on april 15, 1912.
it was a luxury passenger liner that sank in the north atlantic ocean after striking an iceberg during its inaugural voyage from southampton, uk, to new york city, us.
the catastrophic event resulted in the loss of 1,514 lives, making it the third deadliest non-military maritime disaster ever recorded.
the collision with the iceberg occurred at 11:40 pm on april 14, 1912, approximately 375 miles south of newfoundland, causing five of the sixteen watertight compartments to flood.
in the following two and a half hours, the ship filled with water and eventually sank.
despite efforts to evacuate passengers and some crew members in lifeboats, many were launched under capacity.
tragically, as the clock neared 2:20 am, the titanic broke apart and sunk bow-first, with over a thousand individuals still on board.
those who found themselves in the freezing ocean waters succumbed to hypothermia within minutes.
fortunately, the rms carpathia arrived a few hours later to rescue the 710 survivors from the lifeboats.
the initial phase of a project aimed at implementing expanded bike lanes and reducing vehicle lanes on folsom street in boulder has been successfully executed.
dubbed as "right-sizing" by boulder transportation planners, this lane-reallocation initiative serves as a pilot study to evaluate the potential increase in bike ridership following the installation of broader and well-protected bike lanes.
the primary objective is to assess the impact on vehicle travel times and accidents by transitioning to a single travel lane in each direction along with a central turn lane.
despite the necessity of reducing vehicle lanes to accommodate the wider bike lanes, transportation planners are confident that the central turn lane will not only decrease accidents but also minimize disruptions in travel times.
recent developments include the installation of new bike lanes with striped buffer zones stretching from valmont road to canyon boulevard on folsom street, transforming it from dual travel lanes in each direction to one lane per direction along with a central turn lane.
additional enhancements set for this week entail the incorporation of green markings within the buffer area and the installation of flexible bollards to delineate the bike lane further.
the city's forthcoming plans involve replicating similar street enhancements on iris avenue in late august, followed by the commencement of improvements on 63rd street anticipated in september.
since commencing an offensive in june in the tribal area of north waziristan, pakistan's military has reported eliminating around 910 suspected militants.
the statement also mentioned the loss of 82 soldiers during clashes with insurgents in north waziristan and operations in various parts of the country.
the military declared that it had gained control over the main towns in north waziristan, previously dominated by the taliban.
media access in tribal regions near the afghan border remains restricted, hence the claims have not been independently verified.
this announcement was made amidst escalating anti-government demonstrations in the capital.
the military clarified its neutral stance amidst the crisis, clarifying that it was not favoring any side.
following the breakdown of peace negotiations with the government, the widely anticipated offensive against the pakistani taliban was initiated.
the military emphasized that significant towns in north waziristan, including miranshah, mir ali, datta khel, boya, and degan, have been reclaimed from the militants.
intelligence-led operations across the country led to the death of 42 militants, with over 100 others apprehended.
the military did not provide specific details regarding civilian casualties, although fleeing residents reported numerous civilian deaths.
since june, an estimated 800,000 people have been displaced from their homes in north waziristan.
while militant activities within pakistan have notably decreased post the offensive, no prominent militant leaders have been apprehended thus far.
acknowledging that several militants may have evaded capture by fleeing north waziristan before the military intervention, the military admitted this possibility in july.
according to sky sports, leeds united is prepared to give nile ranger an opportunity to train with the team.
the 23-year-old striker is currently a free agent following his departure from swindon town at the end of the previous season, primarily due to disciplinary and off-field issues.
despite facing controversy since his professional debut five years ago, ranger, a former newcastle united player, is being considered by leeds head coach dave hockaday and assistant coach junior lewis for a potential signing.
ranger, a former england youth international, recorded seven goals in 19 games for swindon in the last season.
named hector by the locals, this thunderstorm complex is a well-known phenomenon among scientists fascinated by tropical meteorology.
this distinctive cloud formation occurs daily over the tiwi islands, located off the northern coast of australia, during the transitional months of nov-dec and feb-march.
meteorologists find it particularly intriguing for studying the development of cumulonimbus clouds.
these powerful thunderclouds are estimated to hold the energy equivalent of ten hiroshima-sized bombs and reach heights of up to 20km into the atmosphere, visible from as far as darwin, which is over 100km away.
we appreciate the awe-inspiring nature of hector and are thankful to tim garrett for sharing these captivating photos.

the african-american parade of connecticut made a highly-anticipated return last saturday after a long absence.
the atmosphere was overwhelmingly positive, with participants and spectators alike embracing the event wholeheartedly.
however, there were isolated instances of negative chanting stemming from a political campaign, which starkly contrasted with the overall celebratory spirit of the parade.
the parade route spanned just one block, running from walnut to albany on edwards, where parked vehicles lined the streets.
despite this, law enforcement effectively managed traffic flow, temporarily halting motor vehicles to accommodate the parade procession.
the parade kicked off at the junction of edwards and albany, proceeded along the avenue, turned onto woodland, and culminated at keney park, where a series of family day activities were scheduled throughout the weekend.
notable participants encompassed a diverse range of groups, including the weaver high cheerleaders, various religious organizations, a ski club, a motorcycle club, the friends of keney park, the naacp, commemorators of the 20th anniversary of the million man march, and a plethora of campaigning politicians.
trans world airlines flight 800 tragically exploded twelve minutes after departing from jfk airport in new york on july 17th, 1996, claiming the lives of all 230 passengers on board.
almost 18 years following the fatal crash of the boeing 747, the national transportation safety board (ntsb) has rejected a request to reconsider its conclusions, which were initially challenged by individuals who suspected the aircraft was intentionally targeted by terrorism, missiles, or even a clandestine microwave weapon.
despite extensive investigations by the fbi and ntsb into the incident, the primary cause of the explosion was attributed to the ignition of fuel within the plane's center wing fuel tank.
nevertheless, various pieces of circumstantial evidence, interviews with accident investigators, and discrepancies in the reports from both agencies have fueled persistent conspiracy theories surrounding the tragedy.
some theories suggest the aircraft was taken down by three missiles, while others speculate a terrorist bomb was responsible for the explosion.
in a more sensationalized claim, there are notions that flight 800 may have accidentally been struck by a microwave weapon under the operation of the us navy.
a recent documentary examining these diverse assertions was broadcast on american television last year.
the documentary presented counterpoints challenging the official stances of the ntsb and fbi on the crash without fully substantiating the alternative scenarios it proposed.
while hopes were high that the petition for a review might lend credibility to these theories, the ntsb's recent decision affirms that, for now, the uncertainties surrounding the fate of twa flight 800 will persist as mere speculation.
the likely cause of the musty smell is cellulose decay, a consequence of the introduction of groundwood pulp in papermaking during the mid-19th century that replaced cotton and linen.
the inclusion of the unstable compound lignin in paper leads to its breakdown into acids, rendering it brittle.
for over two decades, the library of congress has annually treated a minimum of 250,000 books with magnesium oxide post-2001, a method aimed at deacidifying paper and impeding decay.
lorraine gibson, a chemist at the university of strathclyde in scotland, spearheads the heritage smells project, which endeavors to identify decay in its initial phases.
she is currently developing a handheld mass spectrometer, likened to an artificial nose, designed to pinpoint the specific molecules responsible for the musty odor.
through the movement of molecules down a flight tube, their mass can be determined, allowing researchers to distinguish molecules associated with accelerated decay and subsequently devise interventions to halt the process.
this feature was first published in the january 2012 edition of popular science magazine.
non-league woking caused a major upset by convincingly defeating league one side bury 3-0 at gigg lane to advance to the fa cup second round.
regan charles-cook scored the opener for the national league team in the 30th minute, shocking the hosts.
despite bury's attempts to fight back, inih effiong and substitute jamie philpot scored late goals to secure the unexpected victory.
even though bury, who were at the bottom of the third tier, had been unbeaten in three matches under caretaker manager ryan lowe, they were unable to overcome woking's determined performance.
the visitors demonstrated their threat early on when kane ferdinand missed a chance from matt young's pass, and bury also had their opportunities through greg leigh.
effiong's goal in the 71st minute, followed by philpot's goal in the 86th minute, sealed the triumph for woking.
the defeated bury fans expressed their disappointment towards their team as woking earned the right to host either tranmere or peterborough in the next round.
the match details were provided by the press association.
adrian goldberg, presenter of 5 live investigates, discusses the implications of the proposed us sopa bill and compares it to current anti-piracy measures in the uk.
alexis ohanian, the co-founder of reddit, a key player in the anti-sopa movement, participates in the conversation, highlighting how websites like reddit and wikipedia protested against the bill by going 'black.' christopher marcich, president of the motion picture association, europe, advocates for sopa, emphasizing the film industry's support for the legislation.
ohanian argues that passing sopa could stifle innovation in the us technology sector, citing examples like spotify.
in response, marcich points out companies like megaupload that he perceives as exploiting the work of others without contributing creatively.
this interview originally aired on 5 live investigates on january 22, 2012, and the full program is available for streaming on the 5 live investigates podcast online.
inbox cube is a recently launched email client designed for iphone, with a unique focus on creating a more visually engaging email experience compared to the conventional text-based format.
alongside the familiar classic email views displaying the standard inboxes, inbox cube offers functionality to effortlessly browse and organize attachments and files visually, allowing users to locate desired items through visual cues rather than written descriptions.
currently, the platform is compatible with gmail, icloud, yahoo, and aol mail services.
once users set up their email accounts, they are directed to the primary email view within inbox cube, resembling a traditional inbox layout.
however, the distinguishing feature of inbox cube lies in its alternative views, such as attachments and contacts.
the attachments view presents all attachments in image form, offering sorting options by type for streamlined navigation.
on the other hand, the contacts tab intelligently identifies frequently contacted email recipients and provides the ability to manage and mark favorites directly within the application.
to mark a contact as a favorite, simply press and hold on the desired contact to access the relevant menu options.
notably, the initial search in the attachments section of inbox cube may require a considerable amount of time to locate and load all attachments, making a wifi connection preferable for efficient performance.
for users with extensive email archives like myself, the loading and sorting process may be more time-consuming.
conversely, individuals with fewer saved emails should experience swifter attachment loading and organization within inbox cube.
the cotton ball diet is a harmful practice where individuals consume cotton balls soaked in liquids like juices or smoothies as a means to feel full without gaining weight.
this diet has been widely criticized as dangerous due to serious health risks it poses.
ingesting cotton balls can lead to blockages in the digestive system, potentially causing dehydration, damage to the gastrointestinal tract, and harm to internal organs.
additionally, following this diet can result in nutritional deficiencies and the risk of choking, as cotton balls cannot be broken down and must be swallowed whole.
most cotton balls are made from bleached polyester rather than natural cotton, and the synthetic ingredients can accumulate in the body over time, leading to organ damage.
the oakland raiders game would not be complete without their usual defeat and a heated altercation.
during a match against the cincinnati bengals, tensions rose when bengals tackle andrew whitworth confronted lamar houston for his rough play in tossing quarterback andy dalton.
houston retaliated by headbutting whitworth, sparking a scuffle.
tommy kelly quickly entered the fray from the bench, removing his helmet and getting involved.
the scuffle seemed more like a rough wrestling match than a full-blown brawl, reminiscent of a schoolyard scuffle rather than a professional sports event.
following the incident, houston, kelly, and whitworth were ejected from the game, likely facing further repercussions in the form of fines from the league.
the raiders, on the other hand, will need to learn to channel their emotions more productively as they face their fourth consecutive defeat.
citronella candles are effective in repelling mosquitoes outdoors, but their strong scent may be overwhelming if used indoors, especially for individuals with respiratory issues.
using chemical-based mosquito repellents indoors is not recommended due to their toxicity.
for a safer and natural alternative, consider using an oil burner with a carrier oil like almond or jojoba, along with a few drops of essential oils such as peppermint, eucalyptus, and lemon eucalyptus.
additionally, burning lavender oil near entry points can deter mosquitoes from entering or lingering indoors.
another method is to place bowls or saucers with citrus-scented dish soap in areas where mosquitoes are present, like the kitchen, bathroom, or screened porch, as it is equally effective in repelling mosquitoes as burning citronella candles.
how did we find ourselves in this predicament regarding drugs?
while smoking cigarettes is a popular activity, it poses significant dangers to both smokers and others.
we are aware that eradicating smoking through criminalization is not a feasible solution.
instead, we mitigate the risks through regulations on sales, public awareness campaigns to encourage smoking cessation, advertising restrictions, addiction treatment, and other interventions.
the costly and ineffective war on drugs yields negative consequences.
alcohol consumption, though enjoyed by many, can result in severe harm to individuals, families, and society due to issues like violence.
history has shown that criminalizing drinking, as attempted during the prohibition era in the united states, does not work.
therefore, harm reduction strategies such as regulating sales and implementing other measures are employed.
similarly, gambling is a popular pastime that can cause harm to individuals and their families.
recognizing that making gambling illegal is not a viable solution, harm reduction efforts like regulating gambling activities and implementing additional measures are utilized.

the attendance at the september 29th episode of smackdown in albany was below expectations with only 4,000 in the crowd, a low turnout for a usually strong draw in the city.
wwe had to upgrade fans to fill seats in view of the camera, with the upper deck covered by a tarp.
it was also noted by ken aubin, a wrestlezone fan in attendance, that two lower sections of the arena were tarped off as well.
in a shift from their usual strategy, wwe is looking to explore new markets by planning house shows in oslo, norway, and stockholm during their european tour in april.
these markets have not typically been on wwe's radar due to lack of tv exposure, but the company is aiming to establish a presence on television in both countries, inspired by the success of ufc tv in those regions.
manchester united midfielder marouane fellaini was forced to leave the field after just 29 minutes during belgium's eventful triumph over bosnia-herzegovina.
fellaini, a regular in united's recent premier league matches, was seen to have sustained a knee injury.
belgium manager roberto martinez expressed concerns that the 29-year-old might have damaged his ligaments.
the victory was sealed by yannick carrasco's goal as belgium secures their spot in next year's world cup after topping group h.
despite this defeat, bosnia-herzegovina surrendered their second-place spot to greece, who now have a chance to qualify for the play-offs by winning against gibraltar on tuesday and hoping for favorable outcomes in other group matches.
belgium initially took the lead through thomas meunier, only for the hosts to equalize with goals from haris medunjanin and edin visca.
michy batshuayi from chelsea and jan vertonghen from tottenham put belgium back in the lead, but bosnia-herzegovina later leveled with a goal by dario dumic in the 82nd minute.
however, carrasco's goal in the following minute secured belgium the win.
the introduction of europeans resulted in the erosion of indigenous culture, leading to enduring mental health challenges, high suicide rates, and widespread alcohol abuse among indigenous communities.

despite numerous requests for a my little mages of sombra, i have consistently declined citing a lack of creative possibilities beyond existing humanized versions.
however, a fresh concept emerged in my mind recently: an amalgamation of sombra's smoke and solid forms.
in this rendition, sombra exists as a smoke monster but has self-manifested into a human silhouette within a suit of armor.
initially hesitant to depict mages sombra due to the complexity of drawing elaborate medieval armor accurately in three dimensions with symmetry, i found a unique approach that i am eager to explore.

summer camp attendees and fans of summer camp movies are likely familiar with the common gag involving dipping a sleeping person's hand in water to induce urination.
the concept suggests that the feeling of water could trigger the sleeper's bladder and lead to an embarrassing accident.
despite numerous claims supporting this theory, jamie hyneman and adam savage from mythbusters decided to investigate its validity.
to properly test the prank, they made sure the individuals being targeted were genuinely asleep.
they took turns using sleep monitoring equipment to confirm their sleep status.
while jamie struggled to fall asleep, adam and crew member matt successfully dozed off.
however, the attempt to make them urinate by immersing their hands in water failed to yield any wet results.
despite objections from prank enthusiasts, the mythbusters' experiment debunked the hand-in-water trick as ineffective.
flydubai boeing 737 crashed in rostov-on-don, russia, possibly due to the deliberate actions of the aircraft's commander, as reported by pravdaru.
the preliminary investigation revealed that the commander of the boeing 737-800 intentionally nosedived the aircraft by holding the control knob for 12 seconds, as disclosed by the interfax news agency.
despite the co-pilot questioning the appropriateness of his actions, the commander would respond calmly, indicating that "all is well." previous reports suggested a conflict between the pilots before the crash, with one mistakenly maneuvering the aircraft and the other attempting to take over control.
the interstate aviation committee representative noted that there was insufficient evidence to confirm the commander's voluntary actions and that pilot error was the primary focus of the investigation.
the tragic incident occurred on march 19 when the flydubai boeing-737-800 crashed while attempting to land at rostov-on-don airport after an unsuccessful first landing attempt.
the aircraft plummeted and struck the runway at high speed, with 55 passengers and seven crew members on board.
the wreckage spread over nearly a kilometer around the crash site.

dez bryant is keen on remaining with the dallas cowboys in the coming years.
according to a report by nfl media columnist michael silver on nfl network's "nfl gameday morning," bryant is looking forward to securing a long-term contract with the cowboys in the upcoming offseason, as stated by his advisor david wells.
despite currently playing under his rookie contract that ends after the 2015 season, the star wide receiver is determined to continue with the team.
during a recent match against the detroit lions, bryant displayed intense emotion by gesturing and vocalizing his frustrations towards quarterback tony romo, aiming to motivate his team.
however, analysis of the incident revealed that bryant's actions stemmed more from passion than anger.
the cowboys organization, led by coo stephen jones, remains fully supportive of bryant, according to nfl media insider ian rapoport.
there is a consensus within the team that the incident serves as a clear reminder to romo of the importance of involving bryant in the game plan.
additionally, the reported sideline discussion involving jason witten and demarcus ware indicated that while bryant's behavior may have been intense, his teammates were urging him to refocus on the game strategy.
ware and witten acknowledged bryant's point about being targeted by romo but emphasized the need for team concentration during crucial moments.
turkey's president, recep tayyip erdogan, has announced that all individuals suspected of involvement in the coup plot and labeled as "terrorists" will be required to wear specific uniforms during their court appearances.
according to erdogan, those accused of participating in the july 2016 coup will wear jumpsuits, while other individuals classified as "terrorists," including followers of fethullah gulen and kurdish rebels, will wear jackets and trousers.
erdogan emphasized the need for a stricter dress code during court proceedings, referencing a previous incident where a defendant wore a "hero" t-shirt and was subsequently detained along with others who wore similar shirts.
erdogan called for a standardized prisoner uniform similar to those seen in guantanamo bay, where alleged jihadists are made to wear bright orange jumpsuits.
the president reiterated his determination to eliminate all individuals associated with the gulen movement, which he holds responsible for the violent coup attempt that claimed 260 lives and resulted in extensive damage, including the bombing of the parliament.
erdogan criticized the behavior of defendants in court, accusing them of constant falsehoods.
following the coup attempt, over 50,000 individuals have been detained, and 150,000 public servants have been suspended as part of a widespread purge, drawing significant international criticism for the drastic measures taken under the declared state of emergency.

at just 17 years old, tabla has emerged as a promising talent beyond europe's borders, showcasing his skills for both the impact and the canadian national team over the past year and a half.
originally born in ivory coast, tabla relocated to canada at a young age and has since represented his adopted country in youth competitions.

the test flight of the 'world's fastest plane' ended in tragedy when the us military's falcon htv-2, capable of traveling 22 times faster than a commercial airliner, crashed into the pacific ocean.
the highly anticipated launch from vandenberg air force base in california, where the plane was attached to a rocket and separated at the edge of space, was meant to pave the way for ultra-fast flights from london to sydney in under an hour.
however, approximately nine minutes into the flight, the aircraft ceased sending signals and presumably went down into the ocean.
the ambitious project aimed for the plane to achieve hypersonic speeds of around 13,000mph upon re-entry, enduring extreme temperatures of 2,000c.
this research venture faced setbacks, with a previous launch aborted in april due to technical issues and a subsequent redesign of the aircraft.
the latest flight, which was initially scheduled for wednesday but postponed due to adverse weather conditions, aimed to overcome previous challenges but unfortunately met a similar fate.

san diego chargers quarterback philip rivers showcased an impressive comeback performance on saturday night during the overtime win against the 49ers in san francisco.
according to espn reports citing team sources, rivers is bravely playing through a challenging situation as he is dealing with a bulging disk in his lower back that doctors are concerned may progress to a herniated state.
despite starting to experience discomfort from the injury three weeks prior, rivers was compelled to miss practice on wednesday for the first time since 2007.
to manage the swelling, rivers resorted to receiving epidural injections.
while he aims to avoid surgery in the offseason, the option remains on the table, as suggested by sources.
in the thrilling 38-35 overtime triumph, rivers' exceptional performance included completing 33 out of 54 passes for 356 yards.
he battled through three interceptions by delivering four incredible touchdown passes and crucial conversions on fourth-and-8 and fourth-and-10 during san diego's inspiring comeback from a 21-point halftime deficit, ultimately helping to sustain the chargers' playoff aspirations.
rest assured, the truck in question will not drain a month's worth of electricity with each journey up the mountain.
remarkably, this truck actually produces more electricity than it consumes.
it achieves this not through perpetual motion, but by cleverly harnessing regenerative braking as its primary energy source.
during its uphill climb, the e-dumper uses about 30 kwh of energy.
however, on the descent, carrying a load of 120,000 pounds of rock, it leverages regenerative braking to generate a surplus of 10 kwh.
expected to complete around 20 trips a day, in addition to transporting rocks, the truck feeds approximately 200 kwh of excess energy back into the grid.
while komatsu has a history of incorporating electric power systems into its trucks, the e-dumper is a unique project developed by kuhn schweiz and lithium storage.
there is a growing trend among businesses to explore alternatives such as hybrid, fuel cell, or pure electric vehicles due to their enhanced durability and reduced costs.
moreover, discussions are underway in europe to potentially ban the sale of fossil-fuel vehicles in the next 25 years.
the e-dumper serves as a compelling glimpse into the future of commercial vehicles, highlighting the exciting advancements on the horizon.
according to politico, a recent city-commissioned report has raised concerns that mayor bill de blasio's transportation projects, the citywide ferry service, and the brooklyn-queens connector streetcar, may conflict with each other.
both initiatives cater to similar neighborhoods along the brooklyn and queens waterfront, leading experts to question if they will complement each other effectively.
the planned routes for the streetcar and ferry service overlap significantly, with stops in sunset park, red hook, brooklyn heights, and astoria.
transitcenter's advocacy director, jon orcutt, warns that introducing the streetcar could detract from ferry ridership and vice versa.
despite these concerns, proponents of both projects argue that each offers unique benefits, with the ferry providing crucial east-west connections that the streetcar does not offer.
furthermore, as development in these waterfront areas expands, a variety of transportation options will be essential for residents.
the citywide ferry service is set to launch next summer, while the streetcar is not expected to be operational until at least 2024.
mayor thomas menino is scheduled to announce on thursday that he will not seek re-election this year.
the announcement is set for 4 p.m. at faneuil hall, following a morning meeting where he informed his top city hall administrators of his decision, according to sources.
a close friend of the mayor, who preferred to remain anonymous, remarked, "it appears to be the end of the line." sources suggest that the mayor's doctors have advised against the physical demands of a rigorous campaign due to his current health condition.
mayor menino expressed reluctance to initiate a campaign that he might not be able to see through.
despite recovering following a period of uncertain health that led to hospitalization and rehabilitation, he still experiences fatigue towards the end of the workday.
it is believed that key figures close to the mayor, such as spokesperson dot joyce, strategist mike kineavy, and best friend mike galvin, hold crucial information, choosing to stay silent until the mayor's official announcement.
the mayor reportedly initiated discussions about his future with a friend in east boston two weeks ago.
there are suggestions that menino may assume a role at boston university upon leaving office in seven months, although this remains unconfirmed.
menino became mayor in 1993 after ray flynn vacated the position to become the ambassador to the vatican, following menino's appointment as city council president as a district councilor from hyde park.
muslim hard-liners in indonesia organized a protest on tuesday in jakarta against the upcoming miss world pageant scheduled to take place on bali over the weekend.
approximately 200 members of various hard-line muslim groups led by the islamic society forum staged a demonstration outside the mnc tower, the venue where the local organizers are based.
the protesters brandished banners with slogans such as "reject miss world that exploits women" and "go to hell miss world," while chanting "allah akbar" (god is great) as they gathered outside the building.
the site was heavily guarded by 300 police officers.
addressing the crowd, muhammad al khathath, a leader of the islamic society forum, condemned the pageant as an affront to women, calling on muslims to reject the event.
despite the tension, the protest remained peaceful and dispersed following discussions between protest leaders and pageant organizers.
contestants had already begun to arrive for the competition, which will include events in bali and conclude with the final round on september 28 near jakarta.
the indonesian ulema council, the country's foremost clerics group, had previously urged the government to cancel the event, citing violations of islamic principles due to the skin exposure in the competition.
organizers had agreed to remove the bikini segment and have participants wear more conservative sarongs instead.
confirming this decision, the chairwoman of the miss world organization, julia morley, assured that none of the contestants would be wearing bikinis.
while indonesia is predominantly moderate in its practice of islam, there has been a rise in the vocalization of extremist views in recent years within the country, which holds the world's largest muslim population and is officially a secular nation with 240 million inhabitants.
canada's government has disclosed that around thirty fugitives sought for war crimes or crimes against humanity are potentially hiding within the country, as stated by prime minister stephen harper.
the suspects have been named on the border services agency's website, with a public appeal made to assist in their apprehension.
these individuals are noted as originating from regions such as the middle east, africa, and latin america.
public safety minister vic toews emphasized the necessity of locating and deporting these fugitives.
the suspects, hailing from countries including afghanistan, algeria, angola, el salvador, ghana, guatemala, haiti, honduras, iraq, nigeria, pakistan, peru, the democratic republic of congo, somalia, sri lanka, sudan, and the former yugoslavia, were identified on the website without specific charges listed.
the border services agency urged individuals with any relevant information to contact a designated hotline.
additionally, immigration minister jason kenney announced plans to revoke the citizenship of approximately 1,800 individuals suspected of fraudulent status acquisition.
the us senate has approved a bill to provide funding for government operations from october 1 to november 15 in a bid to prevent agency shutdowns, passing it on to the house of representatives for further consideration.
notably, all republicans voted against the emergency funding measure last friday.
senate majority leader harry reid, a democrat, emphasized that passing the bill would serve as a crucial message to what he referred to as "radical republicans," urging them to cease impeding government functions by attempting to dismantle the us healthcare law, often known as 'obamacare'.
in the meantime, various business organizations, such as the us chamber of commerce, have called on congress to swiftly approve the spending bill and also raise the government's borrowing limit.
the senate's 79-19 vote to conclude debate on the bill was seen as a setback for republican senator ted cruz, who had sought to obstruct senate proceedings throughout the week with demands to block government funding unless president barack obama's healthcare law was halted.
notably, fewer than half of his republican counterparts supported his efforts.
the bill is expected to encounter challenges in the house, as several republicans are considering adding an 'obamacare amendment' or similar measures that democrats would likely view as detrimental.
should the house proceed with such actions, it may lead to a deadlock and potentially push the federal government closer towards a shutdown on tuesday, consequently placing around 800,000 federal employees at risk of being furloughed.
a sexual harassment lawsuit has been filed against britney spears by her former bodyguard, fernando flores, who claims that she frequently appeared nude and engaged in sexual activities in his presence.
additionally, he alleges that spears inflicted emotional distress on him by engaging in violent arguments with her boyfriend in front of her children.
flores further asserts that spears made unwanted sexual advancements towards him and exposed herself to him multiple times.
he also accuses spears of mistreating her sons and behaving inappropriately in front of them.
however, a lawyer for spears' ex-husband, kevin federline, denounced the lawsuit as unfounded.
mark vincent kaplan stated that the accusations had been previously investigated and found to be without merit before legal action was taken.
he emphasized that allegations concerning the well-being of the children were taken seriously and viewed the claims as financially motivated and lacking substance.
flores, who was employed by spears from february to july, also alleges that his security firm disregarded or belittled his complaints about spears' behavior.
the beefy oregon ducks offensive linemen are making their return in eugene, showcasing a revamped and improved look.
this year, they collaborated with photographers ryan kang and taylor wilder to create a series of provocative "modeling" images.
while last year's original plan for a "sexy calendar" didn't materialize, kang recently unveiled the captivating photos on his instagram account.
the striking visuals include scenes like nine players in togas, one adorned with a laurel crown, indulging in grapes; a rugged lumberjack theme with chainsaws and axes, and a center in suspenders getting ready to toss a log; and a lively pool party setup complete with inflatable tubes and fishing gear.
these 12 images can be viewed here.

undoubtedly, this new set of snapshots is poised to captivate fans and generate similar levels of buzz.
the armed forces minister of north korea has issued a warning that the country is ready to engage in a "holy war" against the south, even utilizing its nuclear arsenal.
this threat was delivered as south korea displayed a significant show of strength to deter further hostilities from its unpredictable neighbor.
during a patriotic rally honoring the military accomplishments of the sickly dictator kim jong-il, north korea's defense chief, kim yong chun, emphasized that pyongyang was fully equipped to initiate a "sacred war" if its borders were violated by the south.
on the same day, south korea conducted its largest military exercise of the year, triggered by a recent deadly attack on a south korean island by north korean artillery.
the drills, located south of the heavily fortified border between the two nations, featured a deployment of 800 troops, tanks, armored vehicles, f15 fighter jets, artillery, long-range rockets, and helicopter gunships.
the environmental regulatory authorities are currently investigating an overflow incident that occurred at the bengalla coal mine dam, marking the third mine spill within the hunter region that is now under review.
the spill at the bengalla coal mine dam occurred last friday, with the mine operators, rio tinto, confirming that there was no dam wall failure.
earlier in january, a section of rio tinto's warkworth sediment dam collapsed due to heavy rains, as documented by john krey via the newcastle herald.
similarly, this month, the walls at two other sites - rio's warkworth mine and peabody energy's wambo mine - gave way during intense rainfall, potentially resulting in the release of millions of litres of sediment-laden water into adjacent rivers.
despite the nsw environment protection authority reporting that water from the warkworth mine site was still being released as of friday, a rio spokesman later clarified that the discharge from the dam had ceased on the same day.

last week, the seahawks released drew nowak, who was their starting center at the beginning of last year, despite the anticipation that another team would acquire him due to the roster limit of 90 players.
the chiefs fulfilled that expectation by signing nowak, as well as three players who stood out during rookie minicamp tryouts - offensive linemen zach sterup and garrick mayweather, and defensive back shannon edwards.
in order to create space for these new additions, the chiefs let go of offensive linemen jake bernstein, ben clarke, and laurence gibson, as well as defensive back jordan kovacs.
although nowak had lost his starting position midway through the previous season and concluded the year on the practice squad, the seahawks re-signed him this offseason, only to release him later to accommodate their undrafted rookie recruits.
besides placing the officer on restricted duty, the msp is making efforts to reach out to kin moy, the man who recorded the video.
however, moy has yet to respond to their attempts to contact him.
the msp stated, "the individual who posted the video showing a trooper using pepper spray during a demonstration in boston last week has not yet responded to multiple requests made by state police." moy informed various media sources that he intends to seek guidance from the aclu and consult with a lawyer before engaging further with an official inquiry into the matter.
i should be accustomed to it by now, but few things infuriate me more than when our adversaries argue that legalizing marijuana results in introducing "another intoxicant" to society.
variations of the argument, "we already have enough issues with alcohol and tobacco," have become a favorite tactic of the anti-reform group.
however, they have never advocated for the prohibition of beer or cigarettes.
if the catastrophic fears of our opponents had any validity, life in california would be a nightmarish scenario.
marijuana is far from "new," especially in a state that has had dispensaries for more than a decade.
only a small fraction of californians are eagerly awaiting the passage of prop 19 so they can use marijuana and become a societal burden.
however, i believe our opposition is aware of this.
their genuine concern is that nothing disastrous will occur, exposing their argument for maintaining cannabis criminalization as deceitful.
labour mp lianne dalziel has reportedly approached sam johnson, the founder of christchurch's student volunteer army, suggesting that they team up to challenge mayor bob parker in the upcoming local body elections.
there has been ongoing speculation about potential candidates running against parker in october, and it has been revealed that dalziel has proposed johnson, aged 24, as her potential running mate and potential deputy mayor.
for johnson to assume the deputy mayor role, he would first need to be elected as a councillor.
dalziel has also been considering other candidates as potential running mates.
johnson gained national recognition for organizing the student army that assisted those affected by the earthquakes and was named young new zealander of the year in 2012.
currently serving on the riccarton-wigram community board, johnson expressed interest in seeking a seat on the city council but emphasized that he has not made a final decision yet.
when asked for comments, neither dalziel nor johnson responded.
however, sources believe that johnson has discussed this opportunity with a select few city leaders.
earlier, dalziel had hinted that a mayoral bid was unlikely but not entirely ruled out.
another potential contender against parker is city councillor tim carter, who has been critical of parker's performance and has been actively campaigning.
the unsolved murder case of six-year-old jonbenet ramsey captivated the nation, continuing to intrigue years after its occurrence.
the questions surrounding who killed the young beauty queen and the motives behind it, as well as suspicions of cover-ups and falsehoods, remain unresolved.
in "jonbenet," an exhaustive examination of the ramsey murder by former lead boulder police detective steve thomas, the intricate details of the case are meticulously explored.
thomas delves into the mishandling of the investigation from its inception, highlighting the negligence that led to the contamination of the crime scene.
he raises pertinent questions about the special treatment given to john and patsy ramsey, including their evasion of early interrogation and polygraph tests despite displaying erratic and suspicious behavior.
furthermore, thomas scrutinizes the overlooked evidence, unquestioned witnesses, and the preferential access the ramseys had to confidential information and police reports, all contributing to the enigma surrounding the case.
according to sources, the indian government has granted permission to prosecute 21 internet companies, which include facebook, yahoo!, and google, for their association with the dissemination of objectionable content online.
this decision could potentially result in the summoning of company executives to face serious allegations such as incitement of religious enmity and propagation of social unrest in a trial court located in new delhi.
an official and a legal representative have confirmed this development.
the legal action was instigated by local journalist vinay rai, who initially filed a criminal complaint in a lower court against these online giants, attributing them responsibility for the dissemination of offensive material by their users.
rai further alleged that the companies violated regulations aimed at preserving religious harmony and national unity in india.
the image of an online cartoon depicting savita bhabhi is mentioned as a subject that sparked controversy and raised concerns about indian government censors' oversight boundaries.
during a debate regarding heightened customs checks on the russia-lithuania border, trade commissioner karel de gucht cautioned russia that any action against one member state would be seen as a challenge to the entire european union.
russian customs officials' recent implementation of prolonged inspections on lithuanian trucks at the border has resulted in significant delays and congestion.
in response, lithuanian foreign minister linas linkevicius suggested the possibility of retaliatory measures at the kaliningrad border, an enclave encircled by lithuania and poland and serving as a vital baltic port.
de gucht discussed the option of summoning the russian ambassador during an emergency debate with meps on october 8, 2013, recognizing that an immediate solution was not readily available but asserting a commitment to compiling a comprehensive list of issues faced with russia.
speculation arose that the increased checks were linked to the european commission's probe into alleged market manipulation by russia's gazprom.

amid a deepening electricity crisis in the gaza strip, hundreds of palestinians protested along the territory's borders with israel on friday.
international rights groups have sounded the alarm about the dire situation, warning of a potential "total collapse" of essential services.
with just a few hours of power available each day for the two million residents of gaza, daily life has been severely disrupted as basic services are on the brink of failure, sparking fears of an impending humanitarian catastrophe.
recently, israel slashed its electricity supply to gaza to about three hours a day in response to palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas halting funding for electricity to the besieged territory, a move seen as a tactic to increase pressure on the rival hamas movement.
the un's humanitarian coordinator for the occupied palestinian territories, robert piper, emphasized the disastrous impact of the decreased electricity supply, which, coupled with heightened demand during the ramadan holiday season, has led to rotating power outages lasting only two to four hours at a time.
the dwindling power availability has forced residents to meticulously plan their daily activities, such as purchasing food each day due to the lack of refrigeration, running hospitals on generators due to fuel shortages, and coordinating tasks like laundry or showers based on the limited hours of electricity, with many households relying on electric water pumps, meaning no electricity equals no water.
a fossilized bone fragment, measuring just one centimeter in length and dating back around 240 million years, is offering compelling evidence that a lineage of large lizards inhabiting new zealand can trace their origins back to a time preceding the age of the dinosaurs.
although unearthed in vellberg, germany, rather than in new zealand, this ancient jaw bone discovery extends the history of the new zealand tuatara by an additional 10 to 15 million years.
rainer schoch, from the stuttgart natural history museum, highlighted in the journal bmc evolutionary biology that this find, along with subsequent discoveries such as a full skeleton, will enhance our understanding of the evolutionary path of these reptiles.
tuataras, linked to both snakes and monitor lizards, belong to a species that ranged between five and ten centimeters in size, featuring a distinctive characteristic of teeth growing directly from the jaw.
described often as "living fossils," tuataras still thrive on various islands off the coast of new zealand due to their long and conservative lineage.
despite his reluctance with the term, schoch acknowledged that it somewhat applies in this case.
the excavation site in southwest germany has yielded over 25 new species in the last 13 years, with hopes for more discoveries in the future.
the notable findings in vellberg include specimens reaching up to six meters in length, with paleontologists from washington, buenos aires, london, and berlin lending their expertise to the ongoing excavation efforts.
governor mohammad ayob of imam sahib district in kunduz province reported that a 23-year-old woman and a 28-year-old man were stoned to death by the taliban in mullah quli village due to their extramarital affair.
abdul satar, a resident of mullah quli village, mentioned that around 100 individuals, mostly taliban insurgents, gathered on sunday evening where the condemned couple confessed to their relationship.
the man was married, while the woman was engaged to another person.
the taliban imposed the punishment of stoning to death on the couple, and some individuals from the crowd participated in executing the sentence until their demise.
the victims, with their hands tied behind their backs, were compelled to stand in an open field for the punishment to be carried out.
a local taliban commander, affirming the incident, stated that the couple was stoned to death after confessing to eloping.
this severe penalty was carried out based on islamic sharia law, which dictates death by stoning for those engaged in extramarital affairs.
the ruthless actions of the taliban, such as public flogging and executing a pregnant widow for alleged adultery, serve as a distressing reminder of their brutal governance from 1996 to 2001, where harsh punishments were swiftly administered.
this includes amputations for theft and executions for individuals accused of spying for foreign forces, reflecting the continuation of severe justice in regions under taliban control amidst ongoing conflict.
project aura, the team at google dedicated to wearable technology, has been diligently refining various iterations of the original glass headset.
recent fcc filings shed light on a potential future device from the project.
the workplace-focused version of glass revealed in the documents resembles the familiar design with a glass prism, now featuring a foldable hinge for easy storage in pockets akin to regular eyeglasses.
while one image in the filings exhibits a device retaining the original glass' nose bridge, it remains uncertain if the final "enterprise version" of glass will secure to a headband-style metal piece that rests on the user's nose.
upgrades to the new glass reportedly include support for 5ghz wi-fi, an enhanced built-in battery, a quicker intel processor, and an improved camera.
the expanded prism is expected to augment the field of view of glass' floating display, as reported by the wall street journal.
additionally, the device is announced to be waterproof and more resilient to withstand falls and harsh conditions in industrial settings.
although google has not officially recognized the device, including details such as release dates or pricing, reports suggest that numerous units have been distributed to collaborators in google's glass for work initiative.
partners are speculated to have tailored specialized software for the device, likely for dedicated use in specific environments.
the fate of a potential android operating system for glass or the release of a consumer version remains uncertain.
a woman from oregon admitted to being guilty of a heinous act where she tossed her boyfriend's pet dog into traffic amid a heated breakup.
shellie hubbard, aged 46, was engaged in a dispute with her partner, darwin vonschirmer, in december the previous year as they were driving along a highway in washington state, according to the columbian.
legal representatives clarified that the couple was on the verge of ending their relationship.
reports from the authorities indicated that hubbard not only injured vonschirmer by cutting his hand with a broken coffee mug but also callously threw their catahoula leopard hound dog named peanut butter out of the moving vehicle and into the path of oncoming traffic which led to the dog's tragic demise.
the associated press stated that on friday, hubbard entered a guilty plea for charges of first-degree animal cruelty, third-degree assault, and possession of methamphetamine.
judge barbara johnson meted out a seven-month jail sentence to hubbard, highlighting the extreme recklessness and endangerment she had caused not only to the innocent animal but also to other motorists.
additionally, hubbard is prohibited by law from owning pets for the next five years as a further consequence.
regrettably, this incident is not an isolated one regarding animal mistreatment.
in a separate incident in august, a woman from texas faced arrest for dragging her small terrier, mimi, behind an suv at a sluggish speed of 10 mph under the guise of taking it for a "walk." the individual was employed by a company specializing in manufacturing helicopter components, which frequently catered to the german military.
he was required to undergo a security clearance evaluation administered by the german economic affairs ministry but did not meet the criteria due to his association with the church of scientology.
despite his assertion that his affiliation with scientology was a personal religious choice, the mechanic's plea was dismissed by the court on tuesday.
the court justified its decision by pointing out that the practice of auditing within scientology, involving the recording of personal thoughts and experiences, raised concerns about the individual's reliability in handling classified information and his allegiance to the constitution.
it was emphasized that this ruling did not infringe upon the man's religious freedom.
unlike the united states, where scientology is recognized as a religion, the german government holds a skeptical view towards the organization, often regarding it as a threat to freedom and democracy.
past court rulings have endorsed closer monitoring of scientology due to its perceived subversive activities.
australia and america share a profound bond, rooted in robust cultural, historical, social, and economic connections.
maintaining a strong relationship between australia and the usa is of paramount importance for both present and future generations, who must recognize and cherish the significance of this friendship.

the recent cold spell has tragically resulted in the deaths of two individuals in tha pla district of uttaradit.
room in-jae, the president of the ta faek tambon administration organisation, disclosed that the temperature had plummeted to 9°c yesterday morning in the vicinity of the sirikit dam, leading to the fatalities of two individuals suffering from asthma due to the severe cold.

general motors has issued a recall for over 38,000 chevrolet and buick eassist light hybrid cars due to a potential fire hazard.
the recall was announced on monday after the automaker discovered that circuit boards in the trunk could overheat, leading to the draining of the cars' 12-volt battery and the illumination of warning lights.
ignoring these indicators may result in engine stalling and a fire risk in the trunk, according to gm.
it's important to note that this issue is separate from the vehicles' rechargeable lithium-ion battery used in the eassist hybrid system.
the affected models include 38,197 chevrolet malibu eco and buick lacrosse and regal sedans from the 2012 and 2013 model years.
most incidents have occurred within the first 1,000 miles of driving, gm reported.
the problem was identified in october 2012, prompting a temporary halt in production to address the issue.
therefore, vehicles produced after december 2012 are not subject to the recall.
a trunk fire incident in march 2013 triggered the recall, but gm stated that no injuries or accidents have been linked to this issue.
owners of the affected vehicles are advised to promptly bring their cars to a dealership upon noticing any warning lights.
gm will soon reach out to owners to address the recall.
ousted tunisian president zine el-abidine ben ali claimed he was deceived into leaving his country for saudi arabia, as tunisia commences a trial in absentia, marking the first of several anticipated legal proceedings stemming from his lengthy tenure.
ben ali indicated on monday through a statement released by his legal representatives that he had departed for saudi arabia with the intention of ensuring his family's safety, planning to promptly return to tunisia.
however, he alleged that the aircraft's crew disregarded his instructions to delay departure, resulting in his exclusion.
ben ali sought refuge in saudi arabia in january amidst widespread demonstrations against his autocratic rule of 23 years.
the deposed leader is facing trial in absentia on monday for a range of charges including embezzlement, money laundering, and drug trafficking.
additional trials are anticipated with charges such as plotting against the state and voluntary manslaughter.
over 90 criminal cases are pending against ben ali and his associates.
officials have announced that the former president will be prosecuted in both military and civilian courts, despite his denial of all accusations.
tunisian authorities have unsuccessfully requested saudi arabia to extradite ben ali and his wife, leila trabelsi.
numerous tunisians believe that ben ali and his relatives accumulated considerable wealth through illegitimate means.
during the january uprising, demonstrators ransacked and set fire to numerous enterprises and opulent residences belonging to the family.
ben ali contends that the alleged vast sums of money were never in his possession.
some information in this report was sourced from afp and reuters.
the 2013 season has come to a close, signifying a time for players to shift their focus back to training.
colin kaepernick recently announced his plans to kickstart his offseason program in miami.
while he made a brief stop in new york city during the super bowl week, the 49ers qb opted not to stay for the game.
kaepernick looks to follow the training regimen recommended by frank gore and anquan boldin at a facility in miami, likely the bommarito performance systems as mentioned in an article.
founded in 2004 by pete bommarito, bps has locations in the michael-ann russell jewish community center in north miami beach, and davie.
the center specializes in enhancing athletes' footwork, strength, endurance, power, agility, movement position work, and aquatics training.
frank gore, who first trained with bommarito ahead of the 2005 nfl draft, endorsed the facility to kaepernick.
wide receiver quinton patton is expected to join kaepernick in the training sessions, aiming to enhance their on-field chemistry.
with kaepernick expressing confidence in patton, an extensive offseason together promises to reinforce that trust, although the timing of patton's arrival to train with kaepernick is yet to be revealed.
the notion of centering a feature-length movie around just one actor or actress can send most filmmakers spiraling into levels of sheer insanity.
while crafting a successful film using an entire ensemble can be challenging, the task of creating something extraordinary—or even watchable—around a single performer is a completely different beast.
these solo acts, often dubbed "one-man shows," can be an arduous viewing experience when they miss the mark, especially once the novelty wears off to reveal a lackluster story or a subpar performance.
in these instances, the success or failure of such films hinges solely on two critical factors: the quality of the story and the performance.
it is essential for both elements to excel, as there are no other distractions for the audience to be captivated by.
once viewers disengage, it becomes exceedingly difficult to draw them back in.
however, when executed successfully, this peculiar sub-genre of dramatic cinema can deliver a uniquely gratifying experience, sometimes even reshaping an actor's career trajectory.
it is important to note that while some movies on this list do indeed feature more than one actor—such as the occasional cameo or supporting voice roles—the bulk of the storytelling burden rests on the shoulders of a single individual.
hezbollah, the shia movement in lebanon that supports syrian president bashar al-assad, announced a six-month truce agreement for the rebel-held town of zabadani and two shia towns in the northwest.
hezbollah's leader, hassan nasrallah, revealed on al-manar television that the deal was brokered with the backing of the un and iran, a key ally of damascus.
nasrallah explained that the truce involves the transfer of armed and injured individuals from zabadani to idlib province, while 10,000 civilians from fuaa and kafraya will be evacuated to regime-controlled areas in exchange.
he clarified that all armed fighters will be removed from zabadani, giving way for the syrian army to assume control over the remaining rebel-held territories.
nasrallah assured that civilians in and around zabadani who desire to leave will have safe passage to idlib.
the un spokesperson jessy chahine also acknowledged the progress in the negotiations and emphasized the need for the parties involved to confirm the deal.
previously in july, pro-government forces had initiated an offensive to reclaim zabadani, prompting a sunni rebel coalition to besiege fuaa and kafraya, predominantly shia villages in idlib province.
the truce, facilitated between rebel groups like ahrar al-sham and pro-regime forces supported by hezbollah, aims to allow the evacuation of around 10,000 civilians from fuaa and kafraya to regime-held areas, whereas approximately 500 rebel fighters are expected to withdraw from zabadani to idlib province.
countryside campaigners caution that the national trust may face prolonged conflict if a proposal to prohibit trail hunting garners support from members today.
tim bonner, ceo of the countryside alliance, expressed concern that a ban on trail hunting could pave the way for potential prohibitions on other field sports such as grouse shooting and fishing.
discussions are already taking place among environmentalists regarding a potential campaign to ban grouse shooting on two national trust moors in derbyshire.
baroness mallalieu, president of the alliance and a national trust member, lamented that the charity is at risk of transitioning from being a guardian of the countryside to merely managing a subdued and commercialized theme park.
the decision is anticipated to be made as approximately 500 members are set to convene for an in-person vote at a meeting in swindon today.
this vote is open to the trust's five million members.
bonner cautioned that if trail hunting were to be banned on national trust land, it could initiate a prolonged internal dispute within the trust as hunting enthusiasts strive to preserve the longstanding tradition of hunting on the trust's grounds.
pressuring the saudis to distance themselves from wahhabism may not effectively reduce the influence of jihadist movements such as al qaeda and islamic state.
these groups and their supporters draw inspiration from sources beyond official saudi clerics, meaning that the majority of saudi muslims, including many wahhabis, reject their ideologies.
while saudi wahhabism can serve as a pathway to jihadism, it is not the sole influencer.
for instance, tunisia, which is considered one of the most secular arab states and a relative success story of the arab spring, has contributed more jihadists to syria than saudi arabia.
furthermore, those drawn to the messaging of islamic state from europe and america did not necessarily come from the environment of saudi wahhabism.
bicycles are advantageous over cars as they are more environmentally friendly, promote better health for the riders, and are more convenient in navigating congested urban areas.
however, a key drawback compared to cars is their weight, which can prevent them from triggering traffic light sensors.
this often necessitates cyclists to wait, press pedestrian crossing buttons, or run red lights at intersections.
to address this issue, the city of rochester is planning to install cameras that can detect stationary bicycles at intersections and initiate the light changing process.
initially, these cameras will be placed along bike boulevards, which are interconnected streets designed to divert cyclists away from main roads.
the city has been proactive in building a cycling-friendly infrastructure and the installation of these cameras represents another step in this direction.
currently, two cameras have been set up at specific locations within the first bike boulevard on canterbury road and harvard street, where additional cycling amenities such as speed humps, bike markings, and signs have been installed.
erik frisch, the city's transportation specialist, mentions plans to expand the camera installation as more bike boulevards are established, with a total goal of 53 miles of such routes.
moreover, he highlights the potential use of cameras at intersections featuring bike boxes, which are designated areas for cyclists to wait at the front of intersections for better visibility and an early start when the light changes.
seven streets were blocked off in the vicinity as authorities responded to a situation involving a man holding two individuals captive and brandishing what he purported to be a diy firearm in the town of redcliffe, north of brisbane.
the man eventually surrendered to the police and was taken into custody at approximately 8:00 pm, after almost nine hours since law enforcement initially reached the property on klingner road.
the suspect, who allegedly issued threats while detaining the two men, believed to be his father and brother, led to the deployment of negotiators and the establishment of an exclusion zone.
the two hostages were later freed unharmed.
inspector john hallam confirmed that the man possessed what seemed to be a makeshift weapon, leading to a cautious response by the authorities, who cordoned off streets surrounding klingner road as a safety measure.
during a shoplifting incident at a wal-mart store, an off-duty dallas-area police officer who was working security on the premises fatally shot a suspect who was brandishing a stolen crowbar.
garland police have placed the officer on administrative duty as they conduct a thorough investigation into the event.
the officer, in uniform, initially attempted to subdue the 19-year-old suspect with a taser when the suspect tried to flee the store on a sunday afternoon.
however, the suspect, who allegedly stole the crowbar from the store, disregarded commands to drop the weapon and proceeded to threaten the officer with it.
in response, the officer, whose identity has not been disclosed yet, discharged his weapon, resulting in the suspect being shot in the chest.
tragically, the suspect succumbed to his injuries and passed away later that same evening at a hospital.
neither the identity of the suspect nor that of the officer has been released by authorities.
officer joe harn, a spokesman for the garland police, has indicated that surveillance footage of the incident will be examined as part of the investigation.
during a visit by federal opposition leader tony abbott and immigration spokesman scott morrison to the christmas island detention centre, a small group of detainees staged a protest on the roof of a block.
it is unclear whether the officials were in proximity to the protest when it occurred on tuesday.
this protest follows ongoing unrest, with a few detainees also involved in a rooftop protest at the villawood detention centre in sydney, where recent riots saw buildings set on fire by up to 100 individuals.
the detainees are expressing frustration over the lengthy processing delays and the refusal of their asylum claims.
according to a department of immigration spokeswoman, earlier on tuesday, eight detainees at the northwest point facility on christmas island had ascended to the roof to participate in the protest, but by mid-afternoon, only two remained.

intr-un caz socant in iasi, un barbat in varsta de 42 de ani a fost adus la camera de garda a spitalului de urgenta in agonie.

according to the community and public sector union, rank-and-file officials at the australian bureau of statistics are expressing serious concerns about the feasibility of conducting the same-sex marriage postal vote within the timeline mandated by the turnbull government.
there are worries among abs workers that the rushed nature of the postal survey may lead to similar issues seen during last year's census, potentially compromising the accuracy of australians' views on same-sex marriage.
while chief statistician david kalisch believes the abs is capable of meeting the november 15 deadline, some staff members are skeptical.
deputy jonathan palmer downplayed the concerns raised by the union, noting that they only represent a small fraction of the bureau's workforce.
forty inmates have fled from a prison in the northern nigerian town of damaturu following an attack by armed individuals, according to police reports.
the yobe state police commissioner, patrick egbuniwe, stated that his officers were overwhelmed by approximately 40 assailants during the prison breach.
recent months have witnessed multiple jailbreaks in northern nigeria, with some being attributed to the islamist group boko haram.
egbuniwe clarified that there were no suspected boko haram affiliates in this specific facility.
the attackers, carrying firearms and explosives, forcibly entered the prison at daybreak on sunday.
despite attempts by law enforcement to counter the assault, they were subdued, resulting in casualties on both sides.
although no group has claimed responsibility for the incident, the escape occurred amidst a spate of violence in the region, including deadly assaults on churches by boko haram, claiming the lives of around 150 individuals.
additionally, skirmishes between the group and security forces in damaturu resulted in the deaths of at least 40 people, prompting the dismissal of the country's defense minister and national security adviser.
boko haram, translating to "western education is forbidden" in the hausa language, aims to topple the government and institute an islamic regime, endorsing a strict interpretation of islam that denounces western influence.
notably, one of the faction's key demands is the release of its incarcerated members.

the us supreme court has declined to review an appeal from manuel noriega, panama's former leader, regarding his extradition to france over money laundering charges.
despite his preference to return to panama following serving a drug sentence in a florida jail, a us court authorized his extradition to france in april.
initially convicted in the us in 1990 for drug money laundering, with a sentence later reduced to 17 years for good behavior, noriega now faces similar charges in france for money laundering through french banks, with a promise of a fair trial.
his legal team argued that under international law, as a former prisoner of war detained during the us invasion of panama in 1989, he should be repatriated to panama, citing provisions of the geneva conventions to prevent extradition to a third country.
furthermore, a panamanian court sentenced him in absentia to 20 years for the 1985 murder of hugo spadafora, an outspoken critic.
noriega, now in his 70s, formerly a key us ally in the region, has been in us custody since completing his us prison term, awaiting the outcome of his extradition appeal.

taking its maiden flight on april 9, 1967, under the expert guidance of pilots brien wygle and lew wallick.
shortly after, in less than a year, this aircraft debuted commercially as a lufthansa jetliner, solidifying its place as a pivotal component of aviation history.
initially serving as a flight test platform for boeing until 1974, nasa then repurposed it to trial diverse advancements such as the virtual cockpit, electronic flight displays, and wind detection systems.
within boeing's extensive fleet, the 737 stands as the smallest and most widely utilized jetliner.
crafted as a medium-range airliner, this prototype was engineered to comfortably accommodate up to 124 passengers.

currently residing at the museum of flight in seattle, wa, this legendary plane stands on loan from nasa's langley research center, preserving its illustrious legacy for future generations.
when supergirl transitioned to the cw, fans eagerly anticipated her potential crossovers with the other dc shows, similar to her team-up with the flash in her cbs debut season.
the excitement soared when it was revealed that all four shows would participate in a crossover event this year, and it seems production is already in progress.

on friday, police conducted searches at various locations across the country as part of efforts to combat tax evasion following demonetisation, leading to the confiscation of over a crore in cash.
the raids resulted in the seizure of new currency notes from different states including haryana, gujarat, and maharashtra, with several individuals being apprehended in connection with the findings.
in gujarat, law enforcement arrested four individuals carrying rs 76 lakh in new currency notes in surat.
the surat police uncovered rs 2,000 notes in a car at the sachin gidc area, detaining four occupants, two of whom were from nasik and one identified as a fashion designer.

prior recommendations for inter-set rest intervals in resistance training programs focused on post-exercise endocrinological response and other mechanisms associated with muscle growth due to the limited availability of longitudinal trials directly measuring changes in muscle girth.
this review examines recent research on the impact of inter-set rest interval manipulation on resistance training-induced muscular hypertrophy to assess existing practices and suggest avenues for future investigation.
studies comparing different rest intervals have not consistently shown greater muscle growth with shorter rest intervals compared to longer ones; in fact, one study reported the opposite.
rest intervals shorter than 1 minute have been linked to immediate increases in serum growth hormone levels but also a decline in the serum testosterone to cortisol ratio.
over time, the post-exercise endocrinological response may diminish, and the link between acute hormonal fluctuations and sustained muscle hypertrophy remains controversial.
the connection between rest intervals, immune system response, muscle damage, metabolic stress, and energy production capacity, and their impact on muscle hypertrophy is still uncertain and largely theoretical.
overall, current literature does not support the notion that shorter rest intervals are more effective for muscle hypertrophy training than longer intervals or that fixed rest intervals are superior to self-regulated rest periods in this context.

the major banks have made a commitment to revamp the bonuses awarded to their retail staff in an effort to improve customer outcomes.
however, their actions have faced criticism for not being comprehensive enough.
the sedgwick retail banking remuneration review, conducted on behalf of the australian bankers' association, has recommended eliminating bonuses for meeting sales targets and replacing sales commissions for mortgage brokers with a fee-for-service approach.
authored by former australian public service commissioner stephen sedgwick, the review was prompted by a series of banking scandals involving staff commissions leading to misconduct such as offering improper financial advice, employing aggressive loan marketing strategies, and engaging in insurance policy switching.
this development comes in the wake of demands from both the alp and the greens for a royal commission to investigate unethical conduct within the banking industry.
a deltona woman is in trouble with the law for allegedly threatening and assaulting churchgoers.
reports from media outlets revealed that volusia county sheriff's office deputies were called on tuesday evening to address an incident involving an intoxicated woman causing a disturbance at a kingdom hall of jehovah's witnesses.
according to the arrest report, one victim recounting the events mentioned that she was offering destinie farr, aged 30, a ride home when farr threatened to slit her throat.
the situation escalated as farr then tried to grab another victim by the throat but ended up grabbing her hair instead.
during the arrest process, farr reportedly spat on one of the deputies.
charges pressed against farr include battery on a law enforcement officer, corruption by threat against a public official, and resisting arrest with violence.
it is currently uncertain whether farr has legal representation.
numerous existing mobile payment systems enable purchases through iphones, but apple appears to be positioning itself to directly manage these transactions.
according to the wall street journal, apple is reportedly developing a comprehensive mobile payment ecosystem that goes beyond its current capabilities, enabling customers to buy a wide range of products and services from various vendors.
the endeavor is said to be spearheaded by a former head of apple's online store, who is working on its initial implementation.
apple is said to be in discussions with other technology firms about this initiative.
while apple has not officially confirmed these reports, the company has been exploring mobile payment technologies for several years, indicating a strong interest in this area.
nsw police are set to provide prosecutors with evidence detailing how three key figures within the catholic church allegedly covered up sexual assaults of young girls in the hunter valley.
this significant case has the potential to bring the church under further scrutiny and potential criminal charges.
among those under investigation by strike force lantle is father brian lucas, the general secretary of the australian catholic bishops conference.
it is claimed that father lucas was aware of the misconduct of the priest denis mcalinden dating back to 1993 but did not report him to the authorities.
the other individuals involved are archbishop philip wilson of adelaide, who declined to be interviewed by police in a formal letter, and retired bishop michael malone of maitland-newcastle.
between 1993 and 1995, these three figures were implicated in internal efforts to address the priest's actions, including a secretive defrocking attempt due to damning evidence.
the church only reported the matter to authorities in 2003, following victims coming forward to the police and receiving compensations.

a police source reported that a young man, approximately 20 years old, suspected of participating in an assault on a group of jewish youths in lyon, turned himself in to the authorities on thursday.
although he denied any involvement in the attack, he was one of five individuals in police custody as investigations into the incident that occurred on saturday continued.
the victims, aged 18, 23, and 24, were targeted as they were leaving a jewish school in lyon, all of them wearing religious skullcaps.
according to reports, a group initially harassed and insulted the victims, followed by around 10 other assailants armed with hammers and bars joining in.
despite the main suspect denying the use of a hammer, law enforcement authorities believe otherwise.
the assault has been strongly condemned by civil liberties groups and prominent political figures, including the french prime minister.
following a brief hospital treatment, the victims are on the road to recovery.
in beit ummar, north of hebron in the west bank, falah abu maria, a 53-year-old palestinian, tragically lost his life during an arrest operation conducted by idf forces on wednesday night.
the incident escalated when a kfir brigade force encountered resistance inside a wanted individual's home, leading to a confrontation where soldiers were attacked, prompting them to provide cover fire when exiting the premises.
abu maria sustained fatal injuries during the altercation.
according to palestinian accounts, conflicting details emerged suggesting that idf troops initiated the violence by opening fire at abu maria's child, resulting in the son and abu maria himself being shot.
the son underwent surgery and is in stable condition, while another relative suffered minor injuries from bullet fragments.
the idf detained six suspects in the west bank that night, with four individuals facing charges related to terrorism and rioting.
these events transpired within a day of another fatality near jenin, where a 21-year-old palestinian lost his life during protests following the arrest of a compatriot.
the central coast mariners have shared the unfortunate news with their members and supporters that their 23-year-old defender, storm roux, has suffered a fractured fibula and ligament disruption following an incident at aami park last night.
additionally, roux has also sustained a dislocated shoulder, which will be evaluated later this week.
during the 58th minute of the match against melbourne city, roux landed awkwardly while defending, forcing him to be stretchered off the field and taken to the hospital.
he remained in melbourne overnight with club physiotherapist andrew nealon and is scheduled to undergo immediate surgery on his right leg in sydney this morning.
the central coast mariners will provide updates on roux's condition post-surgery, which will determine the length of his recovery period.
they express gratitude for the outpouring of support from mariners supporters and the football community for storm roux during this challenging time.
a 34-year-old woman named emma west, accused of racially abusing passengers on a crowded tram, got emotional as she watched a video of her alleged outburst during her appearance in court at croydon magistrates' court facing a charge of a racially aggravated public order offence.
the three magistrates observed the footage, which has since garnered over 11 million views online.
initially mistakenly recorded as entering a not guilty plea due to an administrative error, the court amended the records to clarify that she had not yet entered a plea.
emma west, a resident of new addington, was detained until 3 january after the court denied a bail application put forth by her solicitor david ewings, with magistrate ian mcneal citing the decision as a measure to ensure her safety.
following her detention, she is scheduled to appear for a committal hearing at croydon magistrates' court via videolink.
west took place after a video capturing the incident on a croydon to wimbledon tram was uploaded on youtube.
the bbc originally envisioned tom baker, known for portraying the fourth doctor in the original series, to make an appearance as the doctor in the film's opening, believing his portrayal would resonate well with american audiences.
however, the american executive producer, philip david segal, a devoted doctor who enthusiast, insisted on sylvester mccoy, who portrayed the seventh doctor, to provide a fitting closure for his doctor.
this decision faced resistance from bbc one controller alan yentob and executive producer jo wright, who harbored concerns about mccoy's association with the declining popularity and eventual cancellation of the original series.
eventually, wright relented, allowing mccoy to appear briefly and without dialogue, a detail revealed in a documentary exploring the production of the film.
this book offers a profound exploration into a complex labyrinth of memories and experiences, blurring the lines between reality and imagination.
it is not the kind of book one would select for a casual beach read; instead, it delves deep into the recesses of the mind, challenging both intellect and emotions.
it beckons readers to venture into unsettling territories rarely visited by the average person, immersing them in the disintegration of a fragile psyche.
through a riveting narrative set in the dark alleys and rivers of jo-burg, sa, the author skillfully portrays a story that captivates from start to finish.
the text oscillates between passages charged with violence and ones simmering with sensuality, while also offering profound insights into the human condition and the relentless creative drive that plagues the protagonist and, to some extent, all creators.
certain passages are so exquisitely written that they beg to be underlined, transcribed, and treasured as a source of inspiration.
i wholeheartedly recommend this book to those courageous enough to step through the creaking door into the chilling realm of mental turmoil that shadow some of our most tormented souls.
this journey not only sheds light on the extremes that render normality precious but also invites readers to cherish the simplicity and joy found in stability.
i used a permanent marker to draw two eyes and a smile on a rock, and my 1.5-year-old son adores it.
this inspired me to consider a community initiative where i would create and distribute numerous happy rocks across the city.
each donated dollar will go toward funding one happy rock.
upon completion of the kickstarter campaign, i plan to document myself drawing faces on each rock per dollar donated, regardless of exceeding the funding goal.
kindly refrain from donating a million dollars, as it may lead to arthritis.
i appreciate all contributions to this project and anticipate it being the initial of many more to come.

if re-elected, the state government has pledged to introduce legislation mandating that motorists maintain a minimum one-metre distance from cyclists.
infrastructure minister david o'byrne revealed that a labor government plans to initiate a trial requiring drivers to adhere to this passing distance while overtaking cyclists, mirroring a successful trial conducted in queensland.
o'byrne emphasized the necessity of these measures due to the deaths of four cyclists on tasmanian roads last year and the increasing population of cyclists in the state.
to bolster cycling safety, o'byrne announced the formation of a new cycling safety steering committee under the road safety advisory council, highlighting the importance of involving ract and tasmania police to ensure enforcement of the one-metre law.
additionally, he disclosed a partnership with the amy gillett foundation to launch a tailored education and awareness campaign specific to tasmania.
"developing a tasmania-specific campaign in collaboration with the amy gillett foundation is a top priority," o'byrne remarked.
according to officials, west bengal chief minister, mamata banerjee, has announced the renaming of six townships in the state.
siliguri will now be called teesta, bolpur will be known as 'gitabitan' after the compilation of songs by rabindranath tagore.
the industrial towns of asansol-durgapur are being renamed as 'agnibina' after a collection of poems by poet kazi najrul islam.
gajaldoba in malda district will be known as 'mukta tirtha', while garia will be renamed 'uttam city' in honor of the late matinee idol uttam kumar.
kalyani in nadia district will now be called 'samriddhi'.
additionally, a new satellite township called 'viswa-bangla' is set to be established near the eastern metropolitan by-pass in the city for government employees.
this move follows banerjee's previous renaming of several stations in the city's metro railway system during her time as railway minister.

a woman was taken into custody after security camera footage suggested she intentionally set a man's car on fire at a petrol station in jerusalem, israel, when he declined to give her a cigarette.
the video shows a woman, presumed to be in her thirties, engaging in a brief conversation with a man before walking away from him.
she then retraces her steps, takes out a lighter from her pocket, and seemingly sets ablaze the petrol pump that is fueling the man's car, leading to the vehicle catching fire.
reports indicate that the driver's brother was present in the burning car but thankfully sustained no injuries.
law enforcement official mickey rosenfeld confirmed the arrest of the woman.
according to his official statement, she approached the man requesting a cigarette while he was refueling his car, and upon his refusal, she proceeded to ignite the pump with a lighter.
the car owner acted swiftly by removing the burning pump and escaping the scene.
employees at the petrol station managed to extinguish the fire.
subsequently, the woman was apprehended, and during questioning, she denied her involvement in the incident.
following a magistrates' court ruling in jerusalem, her arrest has been extended for five days, and she has been directed to undergo psychological assessments.
sleep is a universal and meticulously controlled phenomenon in all vertebrate species that have been studied in depth, yet its precise purpose remains elusive.
moreover, sleep is prevalent in invertebrates, with thorough investigations in drosophila melanogaster revealing that fruit flies exhibit many key characteristics of sleep seen in mammals.
in drosophila, sleep involves prolonged periods of stillness linked to an increased threshold for arousal.
notably, factors influencing sleep in mammals also impact fly sleep.
additionally, variability in sleep patterns exists in both flies and mammals.
changes in the expression of genes related to energy metabolism, synaptic plasticity, and stress response during sleep and wakefulness are observed in drosophila, mirroring findings in rodents.
brain activity in flies alters with changes in behavioral state.
fly sleep is rigorously regulated in both circadian and homeostatic manners, with the latter being predominantly independent of the former.
following sleep deprivation, flies exhibit longer and more consolidated recovery sleep, marked by heightened arousal thresholds and reduced brief awakenings.
lack of sleep in flies impairs vigilance and performance, akin to mammalian responses.
given the parallels between flies and mammals, drosophila serves as a valuable model for investigating the genetic basis of sleep.
recent studies have identified various short sleeping mutants through mutagenesis screens, underscoring the significant impact individual genes can have on complex traits like sleep.
calls are mounting to eliminate the confidentiality protections in place for members of the clergy who fail to report incidents of sexual abuse disclosed during confession.
the current exemptions provided for clergy, medical professionals, and social workers in nsw are being scrutinized, with increasing pressure to hold them accountable for withholding information about crimes they become aware of in their professional roles.
julia gillard and tony abbott have recently joined the chorus urging for catholic priests to be required to report instances of child abuse to law enforcement, even when shared in confidence during confession.
it is anticipated that the upcoming royal commission on sexual abuse will recommend aligning state criminal codes to compel priests to disclose cases of child sexual abuse to the police.
numerous reports confirm the recent releases of philadelphia eagles cornerbacks roc carmichael and curtis marsh, who notably struggled during the team's preseason games leading to their anticipated dismissal.
marsh, a former third-round pick from the eagles' disappointing 2011 nfl draft class, along with carmichael, who spent time on the houston texans practice squad before being signed by the eagles, failed to meet expectations.
as a result, the eagles' cornerback situation is now in sharper focus with the departure of marsh and carmichael.
the remaining five cornerbacks include cary williams, bradley fletcher, nolan carroll ii, brandon boykin, and jaylen watkins.
williams and fletcher are the returning starters from 2013 on the outside, while boykin excels in the slot position.
carroll ii is expected to assume the dime cornerback role and potentially challenge fletcher for a starting position.
watkins, a rookie fourth-round pick, offers versatility to play safety as well.
initially, watkins is likely to serve as boykin's backup.
when developing our games, we typically begin with basic shapes in the initial prototypes to quickly establish gameplay.
however, for don't grind, the game concept was so straightforward that we immediately formalized the project.
we generated spritesheets and commenced constructing the scene in parallel with gameplay development.
our focus was on infusing vitality into lifeless entities to ensure player engagement in don't grind.
rather than featuring the unsettling theme of grinding up adorable animals, we opted for using inanimate objects instead.
we deliberately steered away from the common trend of animal cruelty in games that involve blending creatures, which has been prevalent since the early days of flash games.
the mission of north korea to the united nations sent a letter to the un security council on august 25, indicating the possibility of implementing "tough countermeasures" and warning of "catastrophic consequences" if the council did not intervene to stop the ulchi freedom joint military exercises between the us and south korea.
the letter cautioned against the provocative and aggressive nature of the ongoing military drills on the korean peninsula, already on edge, labeling it as behavior that exacerbates tensions.
mentioning the grave threat posed by these exercises to global peace and security, as well as specifically to the korean peninsula, the dpr korea urged the unsc to urgently address the issue as an agenda item.
according to the korea central news agency, failing to address this plea would signify a concerning shift in the un's role from upholding international peace and security to serving as a tool of us political interests.
condemning the us for its hostile actions despite prior warnings, the dpr korea emphasized its right to self-defense and stated that the us would bear full responsibility for any dire consequences that may ensue.
two recently published patent applications from apple reveal potential future innovations for the iphone and ipad.
the first application introduces a stylus equipped with multi-touch sensors throughout its body, enabling users to control various gestures on the connected device based on finger positions.
for instance, sliding a finger up the stylus could facilitate scrolling, while rotating the stylus might trigger corresponding actions on-screen.
adjusting the grip pressure on the stylus could potentially alter the accuracy or density of on-screen drawings, suggesting a potential enhancement for the future apple pencil.
however, given the speculative nature of patent filings, there is no guarantee that these features will be integrated into a final product.
in a separate patent application, apple explores technology that can determine the hand preference of a user interacting with a device to customize the user interface for left- or right-handed use.
by utilizing various sensors like the proximity sensor, accelerometer, and touch id, apple aims to enhance user experience, especially for individuals using larger devices like the iphone 6s plus.
as apple continues to refine features such as reachability on its larger smartphones, ongoing improvements are likely to be seen in the upcoming years.
it was reported that vandals vandalized headstones in the jewish area of a cemetery located in hertfordshire, uk.
witnesses recounted that seven headstones had been knocked over, while two others were found damaged.
the cemetery in hertfordshire is a diverse one, featuring sections allocated for various religions and communities.
despite the small size of the jewish section, local community leaders asserted that the vandalism was targeted specifically at jews.
following an inquiry, the police concluded the investigation due to lack of leads, which deeply disturbed the jewish community.
despite requests for increased security measures for the jewish section, these were declined.
past incidents of vandalism at the cemetery had also been met with resistance to implementing preventive measures by officials without any given explanation.
notably, the town has been the site of other anti-semitic events, as demonstrated by a deputy police and crime commissioner resigning in 2013 after retweeting a quote by adolf hitler.
according to police, an off-duty explosives expert witnessed a dog walker throwing a hand grenade for their pet to chase.
this incident occurred after a series of five grenades were discovered on a harwich beach in the past five weeks.
a grenade found near west end lane was safely detonated over the weekend, following the discovery of three others near lower marine parade on 12 july.
essex police suspect that a sunken wartime crate may have been disturbed, leading to the appearance of these grenades on the beach.
inspector paul butcher suggested that the crate could have broken up or been disrupted by port dredging, causing the devices to wash ashore.
the most recent grenade, found at marine parade, was safely removed by bomb disposal officers after being retrieved from the dog owner.
inspector butcher emphasized the importance of beach visitors being vigilant and contacting the police if they come across any suspicious items that could be explosives.
renowned food cart the king of falafel and shawarma in astoria is gearing up to unveil its inaugural brick-and-mortar establishment by the end of january, according to an exclusive report by dnainfo.
owner and food cart maestro freddy zeideia will showcase a broader menu at the forthcoming 30-seat restaurant, featuring delicacies like charcoal-grilled kebabs, hummus, and tabouli.
a recent post on the king of falafel's facebook page confirms a grand opening set for january 30.
the new eatery, situated at 30-15 broadway, is conveniently located just a stone's throw away from the original cart, which will continue its operations.
zeideia's culinary journey began almost 15 years ago with his first food cart venture, following his departure from a cab-driving career.
in 2010, he clinched a prestigious vendy award for his exceptional falafel and shawarma offerings.
zeideia takes pride in handcrafting his signature white sauce, tahini, and hot sauce, with the chicken platter emerging as a top favorite among patrons, crafted from marinated boneless chicken thighs.
labor is emphasizing that australian spy agencies must reveal any security concerns regarding a chinese government-owned firm's acquisition of electricity assets before nsw voters head to the polls on saturday.
during a passionate address in federal parliament on tuesday, labor senator sam dastyari urged the abbott government to disclose the insights of domestic security experts at asio concerning the proposed privatization of "poles and wires." dastyari's involvement in the state campaign arises amid uncertainties about the foreign investors premier mike baird has engaged with regarding the sale.
fairfax media uncovered that liu zhenya, president of the chinese communist government-owned state grid corp of china, likely a top contender in the power auction, had a meeting with mr.
baird at a business roundtable event in beijing last september.
recently, the latest episode of events in the south china sea was prompted by an announcement from hainan province in southern china stating that chinese vessels would conduct boarding and searches of ships in disputed sea areas.
these areas are critical shipping lanes through which a substantial portion of global trade flows.
these new tensions highlight the fierce competition for the potentially abundant oil and gas reserves in the south china sea.
earlier in the year, china national offshore oil corporation, the country's third-largest energy company, introduced new equipment enabling china to embark on deep-water drilling for the first time.
this escalation in the south china sea occurred shortly after xi jinping assumed office as china's leader.
xi has shown a keen interest in the south china sea as well as the ongoing dispute between china and japan over the islands known as diaoyu in china and senkaku in japan.
while it remains uncertain whether mr.
xi directly influenced china's recent actions in the south china sea, he does oversee a small group of policymakers centered in the maritime rights office, as noted by zhu feng, an international relations professor at peking university, and other chinese experts.
a petrovietnam website reported an incident where a chinese fishing vessel accidentally severed the seismic cable of the company's exploration vessel binh minh 02.
this incident echoes a similar event in may of the previous year, when three chinese surveillance ships cut the cable of the binh minh 02, sparking weeks of anti-china demonstrations in hanoi, vietnam.
according to a source familiar with the situation, pittsburgh steelers doctors cautiously anticipate quarterback ben roethlisberger's potential return from rib and shoulder injuries on dec.
the medical team's current assessment suggests roethlisberger may be sidelined for three weeks, although they have not dismissed the possibility of him missing just two games and making a comeback for the rematch with the ravens.
despite roethlisberger's exclusion from the recent game against the ravens and the upcoming match in cleveland next sunday, there is concern primarily about the impact on the surrounding arteries, vessels, and soft tissues stemming from his first rib injury on the right side, rather than the initial fear regarding his aorta.
reportedly, roethlisberger's pain level remains consistent, making the timeline for his recovery somewhat unpredictable, with the nature of the injury requiring self-healing and no specific medical intervention to expedite the process.
meanwhile, in his absence during the steelers' 13-10 defeat to the ravens, running back rashard mendenhall assumed a starting role and gained 33 yards on 11 carries.
additionally, safety ryan clark, dealing with recurring concussions, has opted to wear a specialized helmet, one size larger and equipped with bullet-proof kevlar material, for added protection in upcoming games.
contributions to this report were made by espn's rachel nichols.

carter becomes the fourth defensive starter to land on injured reserve alongside lee, safety barry church, and defensive end kenyon coleman.
despite cornerback orlando scandrick having undergone left hand surgery last friday, he remains on the active roster.
prior to the season, the cowboys boasted a strong linebacker corps with demarcus ware and anthony spencer on the outside and lee and carter on the inside within their 3-4 scheme.
however, lacking depth in their overall roster, dallas will face challenges in the absence of their two starting inside linebackers.
they will need to lean heavily on brandon carr and rookie morris claiborne as shutdown cornerbacks to compensate for vulnerabilities upfront and at safety.
this may lead to matches where the defense, ranked 8th in the league, yields more yards and points than expected against supposedly weaker opponents.
the recent defensive setback intensifies pressure on tony romo and the cowboys' offense to consistently perform better, a task that could be eased if running back demarco murray recovers from his foot injury.
with a record of 5-6, dallas trails by two games in the nfc east and is one game behind in the race for the final nfc wild-card spot, with five games remaining.
their upcoming game is against the eagles this sunday night.
according to volksblad, a farmer near bloemfontein was shot and wounded by his young gardener, who then attempted a second shot that misfired.
the gardener, believed to be a minor, first shot a domestic worker on the farm before targeting leonard haasbroek, 58, upon his return home.
haasbroek bravely confronted the gardener after the misfire, overpowering him and causing him to flee.
the attacker was caught by a police officer shortly after escaping.
the motive behind the assault, which resulted in minor theft and injuries to both the farmer and the domestic worker, remains unclear.
both victims were promptly hospitalized after the incident.

consider this: the grand rapids public school district manages its climate systems using a nearly 30-year-old commodore amiga 2000, which is the backbone of the automation for all 19 schools under its jurisdiction.
this system relies on a sluggish 1,200 baud modem and a dated wireless radio to communicate between the schools, causing periodic interference with maintenance workers' walkie talkies.
what adds to the intrigue is the fact that the necessary code was developed by a high school student, now a middle-aged programmer who the district contacts in case of malfunctions.
while this setup underscores the reliability of the amiga, entrusting the comfort and safety of thousands of students to a computer older than some teachers may provoke skepticism.
oscar fingal o'flahertie wills wilde, born on october 16, 1854, and passing away on november 30, 1900, was a renowned irish playwright, poet, and author known for his sharp wit and plethora of aphorisms.
he achieved great success as a playwright during the late victorian era in london and was a prominent celebrity of his time.
his works, including the popular play the importance of being earnest, are still widely performed today.
however, wilde faced a public scandal and subsequent imprisonment for "gross indecency" with other men after a series of widely reported trials.
following his release from prison, he left for dieppe and never returned to ireland or britain, eventually succumbing to poverty.
the boston bruins are facing escalating pressure, not only on the players but also on the front office.
speculation suggests that a complete overhaul of the front office could be imminent if the team fails to maintain their current postseason position.
according to darren dreger during nbc's first intermission broadcast, a failure to qualify for the playoffs could result in significant changes during the offseason.
this may involve the possible removal of peter chiarelli or head coach claude julien.
both chiarelli and julien are fully aware of the intense pressure surrounding the team currently.
dreger also notes that the bruins are actively engaged in trade talks to fend off competition from the rapidly advancing philadelphia flyers, who trail by seven points, and the closely following florida panthers, who are just three points behind in the standings.
emre can's return to training following an ankle ligament injury is poised to provide a significant boost for jurgen klopp as liverpool fc prepares for their europa league semi-final second leg clash with villarreal on thursday.
concerns arose that the 22-year-old midfielder might be sidelined for the rest of the season after sustaining ankle ligament damage in the 4-3 win against dortmund in the europa league quarter-finals last month.
however, can's quicker-than-expected recovery has put him back on track.
participating in a recent training session alongside players who didn't feature in the recent match against swansea, can could now be in contention for a starting position in klopp's lineup on thursday.
he will undergo thorough evaluation by klopp and liverpool's medical team in the upcoming days as the team gears up for their crucial upcoming match.
with the reds aiming to overturn a 1-0 deficit from the first leg following villarreal's dramatic 92nd-minute winner in spain last week, this game now stands as a pivotal moment in liverpool's season.

unsurprisingly, buses are capable of accommodating significantly larger batteries compared to most standard cars.
for instance, the catalyst e2 max is equipped with a 660kwh battery, nearly nine times the capacity of a 75kwh tesla model s.
it's important to note that proterra conducted these tests under ideal conditions, without passengers, stops, or challenging terrain.
operating a fully loaded bus in a real-world city scenario would likely impact its range.
nevertheless, the potential for such impressive endurance is promising.
in many instances, the bus could feasibly serve a long route for multiple hours without requiring a recharge until the end of a driver's shift.
although recharging with proterra's fast charging system may take an hour or more, bus drivers are accustomed to swapping vehicles.
the initial e2 series buses are expected to debut on the streets of los angeles by the end of 2017, allowing firsthand observation of their long-lasting performance.

during a pre-trial hearing in bangalore, a 40-year-old french diplomat named pascal mazurier was charged with raping his three-year-old daughter.
despite his role as a consular official, mazurier has denied the allegations and plans to petition the high court for a dismissal of the case due to lack of evidence.
previously, a lower court in bangalore rejected a similar plea and directed the police to proceed with formal charges.
a trial date is expected to be scheduled this week.
in a recent session court hearing, mazurier's defense lawyers argued that there was insufficient evidence to incriminate him, but judge shubha gowdar disagreed, ruling that he must face trial.
mazurier was taken into custody in june 2012 following a complaint from his wife and spent several months in jail before being released on bail.
a judge in new zealand tired of parents giving their children strange names has granted a 9-year-old girl named talula does the hula from hawaii the opportunity to change her name.
judge rob murfitt declared the girl a ward of the court so that her name can be altered.
the girl was caught in a custody dispute between her separated parents.
murfitt, in his publicly released ruling, expressed dismay at the parents' "very poor judgment" in choosing the name for her.
he stated that the name could subject her to ridicule and hinder her socially, unnecessarily.
the court was told that the girl was so ashamed of her name that she kept it a secret from her friends, preferring to be called k instead.
the ruling was issued in february but only made public on thursday through law reports to protect the girl's anonymity.
murfitt listed other unusual names given to children in new zealand, including yeah detroit, keenan got lucy, and sex fruit, which were rejected, while names like number 16 bus shelter and violence were accepted.
registrar general of births, deaths, and marriages, brian clarke, highlighted that new zealand law prohibits names that may offend a reasonable person, among other criteria.
officials typically engage with parents proposing unusual names to make them aware of the potential harm it could cause the child.

negotiations between the royals and perez commenced prior to february 19th when the team relocated their operations to arizona.
regarding future deals similar to perez's, wong expressed that the royals are open to such agreements if they align with the team's and player's interests.
establishing a mutually beneficial long-term deal hinges on both parties' willingness.

wong emphasized the challenge of statistically evaluating catchers and mentioned that the team used player comparisons to gauge perez's potential.

the san antonio spurs and the milwaukee bucks have agreed on a trade that will result in bruce bowen, fabricio oberto, and kurt thomas going to the bucks in exchange for richard jefferson.
while it is difficult to see bruce bowen leave the spurs as he is synonymous with san antonio, known not only for his on-court performance but also his off-court community contributions.
thomas and oberto had limited playing time, and the acquisition of jefferson provided the spurs with the confidence to part ways with them.
bowen's defensive skills will be missed, but jefferson brings his own offensive prowess to the team.
jefferson's arrival marks a significant addition to the spurs, and fans hope that more moves will follow.
best of luck to bruce bowen in milwaukee; your presence in san antonio will be sincerely missed.
it's a well-known fact that movies often fail to accurately portray real-life situations, especially evident in on-screen sex scenes.
in cinema, women are often depicted as reaching orgasm effortlessly, sometimes triggered by something as trivial as an orchid petal falling, as seen in the movie "40 days and 40 nights." these scenes often show exaggerated reactions and loud vocalizations that don't typically align with reality.
to highlight the absurdity of these portrayals, we've compiled a collection of some of the most implausible movie orgasms.
from kristen bell's exaggerated climax in "forgetting sarah marshall" to the overly dramatic pleasure machine scene in "barbarella" and katherine heigl's infamous dinner table orgasm in "the ugly truth," these moments serve as a stark contrast to the genuine experiences of real-life intimacy.
this montage is sure to make you appreciate the authenticity of your own personal encounters, showcasing how different they are from the elaborate depictions in film.
british islamic associations have recently issued controversial guidelines advising muslim women to adhere to certain restrictions.
the green lane masjid in birmingham's online publication suggests that women should refrain from wearing trousers, arguing that they showcase their body shapes, even in front of their spouses.
the blackburn muslim association, associated with the muslim council of britain, further recommended that women should not travel beyond 48 miles without a male companion.
these dictates have faced criticism from justine greening, the international development secretary, labeling the blackburn muslim association's advice as "disgraceful" and asserting that such conservative views are incompatible with contemporary british society.
it is significant when criticism originates from someone with a close relationship to you.
sarah palin, a prominent alaskan figure and the governor of the state, received notable feedback last saturday from her local newspaper, the anchorage daily news, endorsing barack obama.
this move is particularly praiseworthy given palin's prominence and potential influence.
the editorial decision to support the opposing candidate instead of the local favorite displays editorial independence and courage, especially considering the potential benefits palin could bring to alaska as vice president.
the anchorage daily news has consistently provided detailed and fearless reporting since the surprising announcement of palin as mccain's running mate.
while other major newspapers were catching up, the anchorage daily news was quick to highlight concerns about her governorship.
the editorial emphasized the risks associated with palin potentially assuming the highest office, despite acknowledging her strengths.
although the anchorage daily news may not sway many votes in alaska, its scrutiny serves as a crucial cautionary note for the nation.
this volume delves into the religious customs practiced within families in the ancient babylonian, syrian, and israelite civilizations.
drawing from a wide array of documents from both personal and literary sources, the book provides a thorough examination and interpretation of the rituals associated with ancestor worship and the reverence for local deities.
the author highlights how these facets of family religion played a crucial role in shaping the identities of its adherents.
in the section discussing israel, special emphasis is placed on exploring the connection between family-based religious practices and the overarching state religion.
the advent of state-sanctioned religion during the reign of king saul initiated a dynamic where civil and private religious beliefs vied for influence.
though these two spheres impacted each other significantly, the unresolved tension between them remained palpable.
a detailed analysis of their interplay emerges as essential for grasping the evolution of israelite religious beliefs during the monarchic era.
this book holds particular significance for scholars of biblical studies, assyriology, and anyone intrigued by the ancient history of near eastern religions.
sfdog has reached out to the ggnra to request the opening of the parking lot at fort funston during the ongoing government shutdown due to safety concerns.
despite the closure of the lot, visitors are still accessing the area and resorting to parking along the highway, which poses significant risks.
the ggnra has indicated their willingness to open the parking lot if efforts are made to clean up trash and maintain the porta potties.
the current scenario with cars lining the narrow shoulder of the highway from the park entrance onwards has become a hazardous situation, with visitors unloading children and pets onto the highway side and creating further traffic congestion.

in this context, the introduction of the brigade, a driverless motorcycle concept, serves a significant purpose.
created to help maintain order in smaller communities and enable human officers to focus on more critical duties, the brigade is equipped with an array of cameras, sensors, projectors, and speakers.
its stability is ensured by an integrated gyroscope.
charles bombardier, a mechanical engineer known for his inventive concepts in transportation, introduced the brigade in 2013 as a means to offer innovative ways for people to travel across various terrains.
acting akin to a combination of kitt, a red light camera, and a meter maid, the brigade would autonomously patrol streets to identify infractions such as expired registrations and illegal parking.
it would then submit timestamped video evidence to the local jurisdiction for processing and issue citations via email.
for speeding violations, the brigade would provide immediate notifications to drivers through visual and audio alerts without the need to stop.
failure to comply would prompt the brigade to notify nearby law enforcement officers.
the primary goal of the brigade concept extends beyond ticketing offenders, as it aims to free up police officers from routine tasks, allowing them to focus on addressing more serious crimes and enhancing overall public safety.
renderings of the brigade concept were visualized by montreal-based freelance industrial designer eduardo arndt.

we have long been following the same scariest jobs chart ever, which was featured earlier today.
it vividly illustrates the severity of this current "recovery" in comparison to previous ones.
the data is truly alarming, but we believe we may now have a new contender.
this latest chart highlights the concerning increase in the average duration of unemployment, showing a continuous upward trend without any sign of abating.
despite the seemingly positive monthly job creation, this could signify a deep-rooted structural unemployment issue with a significant portion of the workforce facing long-term exclusion.
this unprecedented situation, with minimal disruptions during the recovery, is unprecedented in history.
however, this isn't the only distressing revelation this month, as we have gathered several other charts that will undoubtedly cast a shadow over your weekend.
the general dislike towards captchas is widely acknowledged due to the frustrating nature of deciphering garbled text images as a means to validate humanity.
users often find them more than just bothersome, frequently finding them utterly incomprehensible.
to counter the increasing ease with which attackers bypass traditional captchas, leap marketing technologies has introduced nucaptcha, a novel solution that utilizes a video format instead of static images.
users are prompted to identify and input a subset of the dynamic characters displayed on the screen.
leap asserts that while distinguishing such characters is a task well-suited for humans, automating the interpretation of such visual elements remains significantly challenging.
contrary to popular belief, leap emphasizes that automation of captcha decoding is not as prevalent as assumed.
reports suggest that captcha outsourcing hubs in countries like india, bangladesh, and china are thriving, catering to spammers.
nucaptcha disrupts this model by potentially altering the video duration based on indicators of captcha exploitation, thereby thwarting the typical economics of such endeavors.
site administrators have full control over these adaptive settings.
in the anti-spam community, nucaptcha is one of the contenders striving to render captcha factories impractical.
if successful in increasing the complexity of solving challenges for malicious entities without unduly inconveniencing genuine users, the viability of captcha exploitation may be significantly reduced.

the wisconsin badgers are currently in search of a new head coach, and darrell bevell, the current offensive coordinator of the seattle seahawks, has emerged as a potential candidate.
according to cbs reporter adam hoge's twitter account, bevell, alongside chris peterson, mel tucker, and al golden, are all considered serious contenders for the badgers' coaching position.
bevell's accomplishments with the seahawks, particularly in orchestrating the successful plays for rookie quarterback russell wilson, have garnered attention.
while the seahawks' offense may not be considered top-tier in the nfl, bevell's strategic play-calling has steered the team in a positive direction.
despite speculation from sites like sb nation's bucky's 5th quarter that deem bevell's odds of securing the head coaching role as slim, it is acknowledged that his selection could be well-received by casual fans.

the federal government has announced that workers from the united states, such as electricians and plumbers, will now be able to obtain their licenses to work in australia upon arrival.
federal skills minister chris evans explained that this initiative aims to connect australian employers with skilled workers from the us to help fill skill shortages, particularly in civil engineering areas.
this move is viewed as a significant opportunity to address skill gaps in australia by matching them with qualified candidates from the us.
applications for this program are set to open from mid-april.
previously, such workers were required to undergo assessments upon arrival in australia, leading to delays of months before commencing work.
with the new skills assessment process, us workers will now be evaluated against australian regulatory standards prior to their entry into the country.
senator evans mentioned that this assessment process is already accessible to workers from other countries, highlighting the decision to extend this privilege to the us as a logical step.
immigration minister chris bowen revealed plans to hold the first overseas skills australia needs expo in the us, aiming to attract skilled workers in key sectors such as resources, energy, and infrastructure.
the nfl announced on friday that brian cushing, a linebacker for the houston texans, was chosen by fans as the recipient of the gmc never say never moment of the week award.
among the nominees for the moment were geno smith, the rookie quarterback for the new york jets, who orchestrated a remarkable 18-17 victory in his first nfl start.
despite the tampa bay buccaneers taking the lead with a late field goal, smith led the jets on a crucial drive culminating in a game-winning 48-yard field goal by nick folk with just two seconds remaining, thanks in part to a key personal-foul penalty against the buccaneers.
meanwhile, tom brady of the new england patriots engineered a comeback victory against the buffalo bills, overcoming a 21-17 deficit in the fourth quarter.

amid escalating brexit tensions in parliament, factions within the tory party clashed over their stance, labeled as "hard brexit" versus "soft brexit".
sir bill cash criticized his colleagues during a spirited commons debate, while labour garnered support for urging the government to clarify its brexit strategy for parliamentary debate.
may's move to pacify rebellious tories by allowing them to endorse a labour motion for in-depth brexit plan discussion and scrutiny before triggering article 50 by march.
nevertheless, the motion does not require a vote on the strategy before the eu treaties' end of march deadline, and does not bind ministers due to its presentation in an opposition day debate.
despite this development, the prime minister maintained her original stance, enabling dissenting tories to support the labour motion by voting in favor of a government amendment that includes qualifications.
the times reported that saudi arabia and israel are currently engaged in discussions to establish diplomatic relations.
sources from the united states and the arab world disclosed that the initial steps might involve permissions like israeli aircraft flying over saudi airspace and israeli businesses operating within the gulf state.
despite a prior trade office in doha until its closure in 2009 due to the gaza conflict, a potential public partnership between the two nations would be unprecedented.
conversely, saudi officials have refuted claims of any advancements in relations with israel as detailed in the report.
the ongoing talks coincide with strained diplomatic relations between qatar and arab gulf countries over allegations of supporting terrorism.
despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties, israel and saudi arabia perceive mutual interests in regional security, particularly concerning iran.
israel regards iran as a primary regional threat, while sunni saudi arabia views the shi'ite nation as a competitor for influence in the middle east.
the wall street journal previously reported that arab gulf nations had proposed normalizing relations with israel in exchange for a partial halt in jewish settlement construction in the west bank.
this deal would include granting overflight rights to israel, establishing direct communications, and lifting trade restrictions between the countries in exchange for israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu's commitment to resuming negotiations with palestinian president mahmoud abbas.
possible terms for restarting peace talks could involve pausing jewish settlement expansion and opening up trade access to the gaza strip.
in marseilles, france, a rabbi and two jewish worshipers were stabbed in an assault outside a synagogue on a saturday morning.
reports from french daily le figaro indicate that the perpetrator, who wielded a knife, was intoxicated and could be heard making anti-semitic remarks during the incident.
the assailant, described as mentally unstable and familiar to local law enforcement, was apprehended near the site shortly after the incident.
one of the victims sustained severe injuries from multiple stabbings to the abdomen, as per a police source quoted in the article, who mentioned the injuries were not life-threatening.
this attack adds to a disturbing trend of violence against jews in france, following incidents like the 2015 shooting at a kosher supermarket in paris that claimed four lives, and the 2012 attack on a jewish school in toulouse where a teacher and three children were tragically killed.

as police in the grosse pointes continue their investigation into suspect gerald day concerning a sexual assault and home invasions, the 27-year-old recently made a court appearance for a home invasion case in detroit.
here, day allegedly held a woman captive for six hours in december.
last month, a bench warrant was issued for day after he missed a court appearance in wayne county for arraignment following charges of home invasion, unlawful imprisonment, and assault of a detroit woman.
day's arrest sunday morning came after an extensive search by grosse pointe police, who apprehended him as he attempted to enter two occupied homes.
a gun located near the scene is under analysis to determine if day discarded it during the search.
subsequently, a search of day's detroit residence produced another gun from his bedroom.
prosecutors are pursuing charges against day for being a felon in possession, as public records show he previously served two years in prison for armed robbery.
amir ali of ridge road, crouch end, north london, attempted to ignite the imperial pub in crawley, west sussex, and was apprehended by authorities after a failed attempt that resulted in his running into a lamppost and requiring medical attention.
ali was later sentenced to eight years in prison following the incident in may 2008, during which he, along with another individual, tried to set fire to the pub.
the other person threw a petrol bomb that unintentionally hit ali, causing him to catch fire.
despite attempting to escape, ali collided with a lamppost due to panic, sustaining a head injury that led the police to identify him as the perpetrator.
despite being captured on cctv footage, ali continuously denied his involvement in the attack.
sussex police is still investigating to uncover the identity of the second individual implicated in the incident.
the pittsburgh steelers have officially named todd haley as their new offensive coordinator, as reported by 610 sports in kansas city.
haley, previously the head coach of the kansas city chiefs before being dismissed during the regular season, brings a wealth of experience to the position.
he notably led the arizona cardinals' offense before his tenure with the chiefs, where he notably achieved the league's top rushing attack in 2010, culminating in a division title.
despite initial speculation that haley's interview with the steelers was merely a gesture due to his father's ties to the organization, it is evident that he was selected based on merit.
the steelers' decision to part ways with former offensive coordinator bruce arians paved the way for haley's appointment.

the sheriff's office reports that mexican cartels are dispatching assassins, known as "sicarios," across the border to eliminate rival cartel "rip crews" that target their drug couriers and steal their resources.

the ongoing citizenship crisis within the federal parliament has led to a ninth mp being affected, as nxt senator skye kakoschke-moore has announced her resignation after learning of her british citizenship by descent.
following a thorough investigation into her citizenship status, ms kakoschke-moore confirmed that her mother, who was born in singapore during its time as a british colony, imparted uk citizenship to her.
as outlined in section 44 of the constitution, mps are barred from holding foreign citizenship.
despite being born in darwin and previously unaware of her british citizenship, ms kakoschke-moore shared her long-held belief that she was ineligible due to the assumption that citizenship could not be inherited from a parent born outside britain to their children born outside britain.
even when her family lived in oman and her father inquired about obtaining a british passport for her, they were informed of her ineligibility.
a truck transporting 27 tonnes of human waste experienced a spill near toowoomba on wednesday morning.
the incident occurred on crowley vale road near the warrego highway at crowley vale, approximately 45 kilometers east of toowoomba, when the driver had to abruptly brake to avoid a potential collision.
according to reports, the arkwood organic recycling truck veered and braked to prevent a merging vehicle, causing two tonnes of waste to escape through the tarpaulin cover onto the road around 8 am.

coby fleener's brief absence from indianapolis colts practice due to a concussion quickly ended as he returned to practice with full pads on tuesday.
colts coach chuck pagano did not disclose the specifics of how or when fleener got the concussion, but it was noted that he did take a hard hit resulting in a fumble during sunday's game against the buffalo bills.
despite his speedy return indicating a minor injury, it is worth mentioning that fleener has a history of concussions from his rookie year and during his college days at stanford.
given the recent concerns over player health, particularly in light of incidents like austin collie's, the status of fleener's health remains a key point of interest for fans and observers.
teachers from private schools are facing the intrusion of helicopter parents who are tracking them to their homes over the weekends and bombarding them with emails and text messages.
a study conducted by queensland university of technology revealed that nearly 900 parents of students attending independent or catholic schools displayed signs of overparenting, leading them to place undue pressure on teachers to ensure their children complete their homework.
these demands on teachers increased as the student advanced in their academic journey.
even during school breaks, some parents maintain the expectation that teachers remain accessible for homework-related matters.
researcher judith locke noted that teachers were perceived as not fully meeting their obligations, especially in higher grades.
she further suggested that overly involved parents, driven by a fervent focus on their child's academic success, may react strongly if expectations are not met and are prone to blaming the school for any shortcomings.
nearly a year ago, nicholas negroponte revealed a partnership between olpc and microsoft to introduce windows xp to the xo-1, causing widespread upheaval.
i distinctly recall the bustling exchange of late-night emails and irc chats as everyone sought to comprehend the implications of this development.
despite initial excitement, the adoption of windows xo in actual deployments has been minimal.
while colombia was highlighted as an early adopter of windows xo, updates on other countries partaking in trials have been scarce.
the situation seems to have shifted, with countries leaning more towards sugar rather than windows xp for their xo deployments.
the decision-making process typically involves initial inquiries about windows xp compatibility, reflecting its familiarity as a standard computer interface.
however, upon closer examination, every country ultimately opted to stick with sugar due to concerns about the additional costs and complexities associated with windows xp.
interestingly, there are indications that microsoft's unlimited potential initiative is undergoing restructuring in light of recent layoffs.
for the latest updates on xp on the xo, readers are encouraged to subscribe to olpc news through rss feed, emails, or twitter.

the incident occurred at the reigners bible church in uyo city during a ceremony to ordain a bishop.
it was reported that the church was still under construction when the accident happened, with hundreds of people present inside.
as metal girders collapsed and the corrugated iron roof caved in, the devastating scene unfolded.
a rescue official mentioned that the death toll already stands at least 60 but fears it could rise as debris is cleared by a crane.
the official spoke anonymously due to lack of authorization to address the media.
the state government has expressed intentions to investigate any potential compromise of building standards.
this tragic event is reminiscent of a similar disaster in 2014 when 116 individuals lost their lives in lagos due to the collapse of a multi-story building belonging to the synagogue church of all nations.
in thiruvananthapuram, kerala police detained two migrant labourers on thursday in connection with the brutal rape and murder of a 30-year-old dalit woman in perumbavoor.
to investigate the case further, the kerala government has assembled a 20-member team, and the deputy superintendent of police in the perumbavoor area has been replaced to enhance the management of law and order.

brighton is optimistic about gaining an advantage in the race to secure chelsea's tammy abraham on loan due to the positive rapport between chris hughton and michael emenalo.
emenalo plays a pivotal role in deciding loan destinations for chelsea's players and sees brighton under hughton as an ideal place for nurturing the club's young talents.
however, newcastle is also a strong contender for abraham's loan move, with rafa benitez personally lobbying for the striker's season-long transfer.
chelsea is inclined to loan out abraham to a premier league club to further his development, especially after his impressive performance at bristol city where he scored 26 goals in 48 matches.
both brighton and newcastle have been authorized to hold discussions with abraham, but chelsea values him highly and is not considering a permanent sale.
brighton's geographical proximity to chelsea's cobham training ground, coupled with hughton's respected position within the chelsea hierarchy, enhance their chances of securing abraham's loan deal.

it seemed inconsequential who one voted for.

the concept of receiving real-time traffic updates on a satellite navigation system may appear mundane when compared to the innovative vision conceived by renault.
in their "kwid" concept car, drivers faced with traffic congestion can opt for a more futuristic solution - deploying a quadrocopter drone from the vehicle's roof to gain an aerial perspective using a control app on a tablet.
the concern arises as to whether it would be overwhelming to process multiple perspectives simultaneously, lacking the multitasking capabilities of a skilled apache pilot.
additionally, the issue of liability in the event of the drone colliding with another vehicle is raised.
renault acknowledges that the kwid may not progress beyond the concept stage, but in a hypothetical scenario where such technology evolves alongside semi-autonomous vehicles and mind-controlled drones, the practicality of this concept could become a reality.

a father, jeff mcclintock, has taken his daughter's school and the attorney-general to the high court in a significant case regarding school bible lessons.
the dispute arose when his daughter, violet, was enrolled in bible classes at a school in red beach without parental consent.
despite opting out, violet was repeatedly placed back in the classes due to an "opt out" system in place at the school.
the bible class instructors, from life in focus trust, claimed that parental notification was unnecessary as the classes were presented as "history lessons" based on the belief that the bible is factually accurate.
mcclintock accused the red beach school board of trustees of violating their responsibilities under the education act 1989 and challenged the attorney-general for enacting laws that contradict the new zealand bill of rights.
the board's chairman, antony wentworth, described the legal action as an unwelcome "frustration" and a "distraction from core business." the initial court hearing is scheduled for march 26 at the high court in auckland, and comments on the matter are no longer being accepted.

the sudeten german landsmannschaft, which advocates for the interests of sudeten germans expelled from czechoslovakia after world war ii due to the benes decrees, has decided to shift its focus away from reclaiming confiscated property for the expellees and their descendants.
in a recent statement to the press, the organization announced that it will no longer push for property restitution but instead aims to promote a european framework that upholds basic human rights, including the right to a homeland and self-determination.
by amending its statutes during a weekend conference, the sl has revised its objectives to align with advocating for the universal application of the charter of fundamental rights throughout the eu.
while former czech president vaclav klaus previously sought an exemption from the charter to prevent potential sudeten german property claims, the current center-left government announced last year that it no longer supports this opt-out.
the issue of sudeten german restitutions has been a significant point of disagreement between the two countries.

recent efforts by the central committee aimed to prevent potential chaos in nablus, following the dissolution of the city council previously led by hamas.
fatah is preparing to nominate amin makboul, the head of its revolutionary council, for candidacy, while facing opposition from another fatah member, ghassan shakaa, a former mayor of nablus.
concerns about corruption within the council have been raised, suggesting that decisions beyond the election of president mahmoud abbas as the party's chair may expose fatah to undue outside influences.

written by kelsey from care2, the message is addressed to nars cosmetics, a renowned brand known for its animal-friendly approach to product development.
however, to comply with chinese regulations that mandate animal testing for cosmetic products, nars has made the controversial decision to test on animals in order to enter the chinese market.
disheartened fans of nars, who appreciated the brand's cruelty-free stance, have taken to various online platforms, particularly instagram, to express their disappointment and sense of betrayal.
many loyal customers of nars are now questioning their support for a brand that has deviated from its long-standing commitment to animal welfare solely for financial gain.
as an individual who has relied on nars products for their cruelty-free status, the writer shares their disillusionment and frustration over the brand's shift in values.
while acknowledging the challenges of entering markets like china without animal testing, the petition urges nars to uphold its principles and refrain from compromising its ethical stance on animal testing.

a deceased falcon equipped with a small camera has caused concern along india's heavily fortified border with pakistan.
the falcon's body was discovered near the historic fort city of jaisalmer in the western region of the desert state of rajasthan, an area frequently used by the indian armed forces for drills and exercises.
a senior officer from the border security force, speaking anonymously to afp via telephone, reported that the bird had been outfitted with a device and an antenna.
although initial suspicions pointed towards potential military espionage, as the camera did not seem particularly advanced, it is being considered that pakistani hunters might be responsible for the falcon's equipment.
nonetheless, the officer emphasized that the chance of the incident being an act of espionage from pakistan has not been discounted, and an official investigation is underway.
this situation bears resemblance to a similar event in 2010 when indian authorities detained a pigeon suspected of spying in punjab.
the pigeon had a ring on its foot and a pakistani phone number and address inscribed in red ink on its body.
russian president vladimir putin is reportedly considering stringent measures to disconnect russia from the internet during emergencies stemming from perceived threats from the west.
the internet is viewed as a symbol of glasnost, or transparency, in moscow, yet concerns are mounting that new restrictions akin to those imposed on traditional media outlets may soon be introduced.
in response to the perceived unpredictability of the united states and the european union, putin has called for a session of the security council on monday to address the issue.
according to putin's spokesman dmitry peskov, russia is proactively enhancing its security measures due to the erratic behavior of its foreign partners.
acknowledging the strained relations with the west, peskov stressed the importance of russia being prepared for any scenario.
reports suggest that russia is seeking to bolster the sovereignty of its segment of the world wide web, potentially granting authorities the ability to disconnect the country from the global internet during crisis situations, such as protest rallies or military conflicts.
the government's stance on internet control has intensified amid tensions related to the ukraine conflict, with efforts aimed at restricting the web's operation internationally during periods of crisis.
amid these developments, the country's citizens may be limited to accessing a russian-controlled online platform.
recent changes in the ownership of a prominent social networking site, vkontakte, have also heightened concerns about online censorship.
discussions regarding contingency plans will likely be on the agenda at the upcoming security council meeting, especially in response to calls for segregating the russian internet from the us and eu networks, viewed as potentially destabilizing.
historically, the nfl and football have been predominantly male-centric across all competition, coaching, and officiating spheres.
however, in a groundbreaking turn of events, the league recently made its first-ever full-time female referee hire, and the arizona cardinals appointed their inaugural female coach.

these milestones not only open up opportunities for future female football enthusiasts aspiring to work in the premier league but also symbolize a significant progression towards diversity and inclusion.
in a significant encounter before a preseason faceoff between the cardinals and the kansas city chiefs, sarah thomas and jen welter shared a brief moment, exchanging greetings and a few private words.
this gesture marked a historic meeting between two trailblazing women, quietly breaking barriers in their respective professional fields.

stoke city has reportedly made an offer for the highly-rated teenager as sources from egypt informed espn fc.
sobhi, currently playing for al ahly, is considered as one of egypt's finest emerging talents, drawing interest from various european clubs due to his impressive performances.
both arsenal and roma have shown long-standing admiration for sobhi, with arsenal's failed trial attempt earlier this year.
sobhi, who debuted for the egyptian national team at 17, has scored one goal in six appearances.
stoke's scouts have been monitoring sobhi closely and have officially made an offer for the young attacking midfielder in order to beat competition for his signature.
stoke's manager, mark hughes, known for recruiting exciting talents like xherdan shaqiri and bojan krkic, considers sobhi a valuable addition to his team.

today marks a significant day in the history of the internet as the fcc is set to meet shortly to discuss chairman tom wheeler's contentious "open internet" regulations.
these regulations have stirred controversy as they may potentially empower isps to establish "fast lanes" for internet service for companies that are willing to pay a premium.
the public, net neutrality advocacy groups, and even fellow fcc commissioners have vehemently opposed wheeler's proposal, prompting him to reportedly revise his rules.
the key question remains: will paid prioritization continue to feature prominently in wheeler's agenda, or will he yield to the mounting pressure and move towards classifying broadband as a utility?
the fcc's live deliberations in washington are scheduled to commence at 10:30 am et, offering viewers an opportunity to witness the unfolding discussion.
alternatively, c-span is providing an alternative feed of the meeting, which some may find preferable.
deciphering eminem can be challenging, with his mix of sincerity and playacting.
it's crucial to recognize that there's truth embedded in his humor, and vice versa.
eminem's skills as a rapper and social commentator were initially overlooked by some due to the explicit content on the slim shady lp, which was so detailed that it was difficult for some to discern reality from performance.
eminem cleverly leaned into this ambiguity on his impressive second album, the marshall mathers lp.
blurring the line between reality and fiction, humor and horror, satire and reality is where eminem thrives, and the marshall mathers lp is no more or less authentic than its predecessor.
this record serves as a brilliant evolution from his debut, transforming his ominous hip-hop into a hyper-surreal, provocatively unsettling experience.
it ventures into both darker and funnier territories compared to his earlier work, showcasing eminem's sharp and astute lyricism that cuts deep, exploring his fractured psyche.
the album's production is equally captivating, featuring fluid basslines, intricate rhythms, and immersive soundscapes.
despite not every track having catchy hooks, the album is cohesive and engaging from start to finish, immersing the listener in its world.
eminem isn't concerned with being easily understood or offering apologies for the blend of fact and fiction within his art.
as an artist, he constructs his own universe, and with this exceptional sophomore effort, he unquestionably achieves that.
although his world may be controversial and enigmatic, it undeniably belongs to him, a feat that many of his contemporaries struggled to achieve as the new millennium began.

former douglas county sheriff's department deputy cory cooper entered a plea of no contest on wednesday to a misdemeanor assault charge and attempted tampering with evidence.
his charges stemmed from an incident where he was accused of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old woman while on duty.
the alleged assault took place on february 10, 2013, at a park near south 168th and f streets, as per an omaha police department report.
the victim stated that cooper coerced her into performing oral sex on him to assist a friend in avoiding trouble.
wowt 6 news fact finders previously revealed in may that cooper was terminated from the sheriff's department due to inappropriate conduct with individuals of the opposite gender during his duty hours.
prosecutors mentioned that cooper tampered with documents in an effort to conceal his whereabouts on the night of february 10th.
investigators revealed that gps data placed cooper's patrol car at the park during the incident.
the 31-year-old cooper, who had served as a law enforcement officer for five years, previously worked as a corrections officer in douglas county for four years.
additionally, he has military service experience in both iraq and bosnia.
cooper is set to be sentenced on june 10th, and he will not be required to register as a sex offender.
according to a recent disclosure by mark zuckerberg during an earnings call, american facebook users typically spend around 40 minutes per day on the platform, comparable to the time spent on household chores and personal grooming.
zuckerberg indicated that there is significant potential for further growth in this usage.
while this statistic may surprise some who equate time spent on social media with daily hygiene habits – where americans spend an average of 42 minutes on grooming each weekday, as reported by the bureau of labor statistics – zuckerberg highlighted the broader context that americans dedicate a total of nine hours daily to various forms of digital media consumption, hinting at capturing a larger market share in this arena.
additionally, a facebook-conducted survey among american smartphone users revealed that facebook members check the site approximately 14 times a day, spending close to 33 minutes on each session.
interestingly, this study showed that facebook ranked third in popularity among online activities, trailing behind email and general web browsing.
flw sources report that derby county is contemplating a move for former atletico madrid winger javier arizmendi, who is currently a free agent after being released by deportivo la coruna in the summer.
the 30-year-old versatile player can operate as both a striker and a winger.
manager steve mcclaren is actively seeking a replacement for winger jordan ibe, who returned to liverpool following a loan stint at the ipro stadium.
arizmendi is just one of several potential winger targets for the high-flying championship team.

while amazon might not be as ahead as netflix in terms of delivering original content to viewers, they have recently acquired the well-known zombieland brand.
there were initial rumors that a tv series based on the zombie-themed movie, starring jesse eisenberg and woody harrelson, would be aired on cbs, but according to broadcast now, amazon is now taking charge of developing the series.
however, it may take some time before episodes of the series appear on instant video, as leaked casting sheets and script excerpts obtained by io9 suggest that the project is still in its early stages.

through my research on diy gun-making, i have observed two extremes.
on one hand, there are makeshift single-shot firearms that are hazardous and unsuitable for effective use.
on the other hand, there are elaborate firearms like semi and fully automatics that necessitate the purchase of specialized components and access to costly machine tools, demanding the expertise of an experienced machinist or gunsmith.
the approach i have devised strikes a balance, offering a practical solution that falls somewhere in between these two extremes.

reports indicate that a saudi f-16 fighter jet was shot down in the northwestern region of yemen amid escalating clashes near the border with saudi arabia, leading to the destruction of a frontier crossing.
the aircraft, which was operated by the saudi-led coalition targeting shi'ite houthi rebels in yemen, was taken down in the bani harith district near the capital sana'a.
iran's press tv stated that two unexploded rockets were discovered inside the jet, which had been stationed at yemen's al-dailami air base.
saudi arabia, a significant sunni power, has been conducting airstrikes in yemen against the houthi rebels, believed to have backing from iran.
additionally, there have been intense exchanges of artillery fire between saudi forces and houthi militia near the border crossing, with eyewitnesses confirming damage to the haradh crossing, a crucial transit point for passengers and goods.
prior to the clashes, the crossing had been evacuated, and residents in nearby towns had fled the area.
the ongoing unrest has raised concerns about the involvement of regional powers such as iran, who support the houthi rebels, and saudi arabia, along with other sunni muslim nations who back the exiled yemeni president, abd-rabbu mansour hadi.
the united states expressed deep concern over the reported passing of activist cao shunli in a hospital in beijing, stating that they were troubled by the circumstances.

the pentagon has ordered a prototype augmented reality display system known as ioptik, created by innovega, which utilizes dual focus contact lenses to provide an expanded field of vision.
this innovative system enables users to simultaneously focus on a heads-up display (hud) and the surrounding environment by projecting images onto various parts of the lens.
the hud information is directed to the center of the pupil, while unwanted light from peripheral vision is filtered out to prevent distractions.
unlike conventional huds used by the us military that are cumbersome and require active focus from the wearer, ioptik offers a lightweight eyewear solution that resembles google's project glass, as claimed by innovega to deliver superior performance.
according to innovega ceo steve willey in an interview with the bbc, the pentagon contract will facilitate the prototyping and exploration of potential applications for ioptik, including consumer uses like 3d movies, gaming, and augmented reality eyewear similar to project glass.
willey suggests that ioptik enables users to engage in a novel human experience, which raises questions given the recent proliferation of 3d technology.
nevertheless, the growing interest in such advancements indicates a promising evolution in the technological landscape.

researchers at a swiss institute have developed a cutting-edge technology that enables detailed mapping of the human brain without compromising its architecture.
the study reveals that the brain may not be as compact as commonly believed.
typically, scientists use electron microscopes to examine the brain's fine structure, such as neural connections and synapses.
however, the traditional method of fixing brain tissue before imaging can lead to shrinkage and distortion in microscope images, making neurons appear closer than they are.
the team from the swiss federal institute of technology in lausanne has introduced a solution by using a technique called "cryofixation," which rapidly freezes the brain and preserves its true structure.
researchers graham knott, natalya korogod, and carl petersen successfully applied this innovative method to the mouse cerebral cortex, preventing brain shrinkage during electron microscopy preparation.
by using jets of liquid nitrogen to rapidly freeze the tissue to -90 degrees celsius, the team obtained accurate brain images.
knott emphasized that "cryofixation" is an appealing method for brain imaging, highlighting that the results challenge the previous notion of brain compactness.
the researchers plan to further explore this technique on other brain regions and tissues.
the study detailing their work was published in the journal elife.

misfits, the newly promoted team in the european league of legends championship series, has recently made an exciting announcement regarding their 2017 lineup.
they have successfully added former kt rolster and invictus gaming jungler, lee "kakao" byung-kwon, to their team.
this significant addition was disclosed through a video on the team's official youtube channel.
kakao, who hasn't played with a top-tier team since his departure from ig at the close of 2015, now has the opportunity to showcase his talents as one of the premier junglers in the world.
beyond his remarkable skills on summoner's rift, kakao is admired for his vibrant personality, which was evident in the team's announcement video.
in the youtube clip, the anticipated misfits starting lineup was revealed, featuring kakao alongside barney "alphari" morris, tristan "powerofevil" schrage, steven "hans sama" liv, and lee "ignar" dong-geun.

local leaders in northeastern syria announced on sunday that nineteen assyrian christians taken captive by islamic state militants last week had been released.
the newly freed individuals, including three women and some elderly men as observed in videos and photos, gathered with church officials at a cathedral in hasaka.
reports indicate that islamic state fighters were pillaging villages along the khabur river, the region where many of the hostages were initially taken.
despite this positive development, many captives still remain missing.
mediation efforts led by sunni arab local leaders between assyrian christian representatives and islamic state insurgents are underway to secure the release of the remaining hostages.
concurrently, the u.s.-led coalition targeting the islamic state intensified airstrikes near hasaka for the third consecutive day, according to central command reports.
the airstrikes signify a heightened response to the militants' offensive actions that displaced over 1,000 assyrian christians, a minority group in syria, from their residences.
federal independent mp tony windsor suggests that australia should direct its clean energy funding towards research rather than controversial initiatives like ''pink batts or cash for clunkers''.
windsor, who is a member of the government's multi-party climate change committee, recently visited clean energy facilities in europe, including the inspection of torresol energy's gemasolar power station in spain.
through the use of 2650 mirrors to concentrate the sun's rays onto a central ''power tower'' and heat salt to over 500 degrees, gemasolar can store heat in molten salts and gradually release it to power a steam turbine, generating electricity for approximately 25,000 households.
in a significant milestone, gemasolar recently became the first solar thermal power station to supply electricity to the grid around the clock, demonstrating solar energy's potential to offer baseload power.
in the upcoming year, china is anticipated to surpass japan and become the world's second-largest economy.
there are concerns about china potentially facing a fate similar to japan's historical bubble burst and subsequent economic decline.
however, china's current economic status suggests it has greater potential for productivity growth compared to japan at its peak.
by transitioning surplus labor from agriculture to industry and services, china can enhance efficiency and align its economy more closely with developed nations.
the implementation of a strategic stimulus package has already bolstered essential infrastructure, supporting future economic expansion.
looking ahead, a shift towards prioritizing domestic consumption over heavy reliance on investment and exports could foster sustainable output growth and guard against the pitfalls of a bubble collapse akin to japan's.

in sandusky, ohio, cubs fans across the midwest are making their way to cedar point, an amusement park just one hour from cleveland, to commemorate their team's victory after the park renamed its signature ride in honor of the world champions.
it all stemmed from a wager; cedar point's public relations director, tony clark, shared that they struck a deal with six flags great america.
the terms were if the cubs defeated the indians, six flags great america had to create a video singing "go cubs go" and rename one of their rides after the cubs.
following the cubs' win, the "top thrill cubster" was unveiled at cedar point.
this high-speed ride is classified as an accelerator coaster, employing a hydraulic launch system reminiscent of those found on aircraft carriers, propelling riders from 0 to 120 miles per hour in just four seconds.
the coaster then launches riders vertically at a 90-degree angle to a height of 420 feet before plunging them straight back down towards the ground.
cubs fans are sure to still feel like they are on cloud nine after this thrilling experience.
a woman recently penned a heartfelt tribute to her husband, a homicide detective, titled "a moment of reflection," which she posted along with a photograph of him seated in the dark on the facebook page of florida's palm beach county sheriff's office.
the man in the photo is identified as nelson ivan martinez.
this tribute captures the profound resilience and grace that law enforcement professionals and their families embody as they grapple with the harsh realities that many would find unimaginable.
despite any opinions on american policing, it is crucial to acknowledge that beneath every badge lies a beating human heart.
behind each uniform stands a man or woman who carries the weighty responsibility of potentially sacrificing their lives to protect others, alongside the somber awareness that their experiences and actions may never be truly comprehended by the majority of the populace they serve.
demarcus cousins has built a reputation for being hot-tempered, a reputation he sometimes rightfully earned.
he has consistently ranked at the top for technical fouls in the league, claiming the lead for two consecutive seasons and maintaining a top 5 position throughout his career.
his 15th technical foul last year in a game against the houston rockets triggered an automatic suspension for subsequent technical fouls.
despite this setback, cousins managed to keep his emotions in check for the remainder of the season except for one slip-up in the penultimate game, leading to another suspension.
to avoid a repeat of last season, cousins has set a new target for himself this year.
an instagram post by reggie evans revealed that cousins has set a limit of 5 technical fouls for the upcoming season.
this determination reflects a commendable effort by cousins, recognizing that as the team's key player, he must set a positive example.
his ability to control his temper demonstrated in the previous season can now be tested and proven over the course of an entire campaign.
the khl's expansion process seems comparatively simpler compared to the nhl overseen by gary bettman.
the kontinental hockey league, headquartered in russia, has disclosed plans to extend its reach into china, introducing a new franchise in the bustling capital of beijing for the upcoming season, as reported by the associated press.
this new team will call the 18,000-seat mastercard center home, sharing the arena with the beijing ducks from the chinese basketball association.

please keep in mind that this deck is designed for a modern pauper format.
in a truer pauper setup, it's advisable to choose rancor over hyena or spider umbra.
this deck, my first foray into modern pauper, aims to create a formidable combo by enchanting a hexproof creature with multiple auras.
this strategy proves effective in pauper due to the scarcity of board wipes.
any additional suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
as an update, i've made adjustments to the sideboard to better anticipate expected matchups.
in our inaugural tournament, i achieved a 2-1 record and secured a victory based on tiebreakers.
from my observations, this deck excels against less interactive opponents who are unprepared for its unique tactics.
for surprise factor at a tournament, this deck could be a strong choice.
when facing combo decks, the matchup is more challenging; my only loss was to a kiln fiend combo deck.
the sideboard provides some assistance, but success often hinges on drawing armadillo cloak for life gain or a fog effect to survive.
in baton rouge, a metairie lawmaker's proposal for drug testing of welfare recipients was approved by a senate committee, despite concerns over its constitutionality.
republican john labruzzo acknowledges the potential for legal challenges similar to those faced by a florida program and believes the courts should determine its fate.
critics question whether the proposal violates rights by allowing search and seizure without probable cause.
labruzzo argues that random drug testing could help address addiction among welfare recipients, aiming to break the cycle.
opponents argue that singling out this group is unwarranted, citing similar levels of drug use among the general population.
currently, the state assesses drug use among welfare applicants through interviews.
the proposal, house bill 7, was forwarded to the full senate with a 5-2 vote by the senate health and welfare committee, following approval by the house.
in november 2017, president robert mugabe was forcibly removed from power in a military takeover and was succeeded by his former deputy, emmerson mnangagwa, known for his own history of human rights violations.
throughout the coup, mugabe's associates were apprehended and detained by the military under undisclosed circumstances.
mnangagwa announced that elections would proceed as planned by august 2018, yet failed to address the necessary reforms in the security sector, media, and electoral processes to ensure transparency.
mugabe's tenure was marked by increased suppression of peaceful demonstrations against human rights abuses and a deteriorating economy.
his government disregarded the rights outlined in the country's 2013 constitution and failed to enact any substantial human rights improvements, with widespread impunity for law enforcement and state security misconduct persisting.
zombies are typically grey, tend to move slowly, and exhibit erratic and frequent changes in direction, particularly if no movement is detected in front of them.
upon spotting movement, they proceed towards it but eventually lose interest and resume wandering randomly.
when a zombie encounters a survivor directly in its path, it initiates a biting attack that results in infecting the survivor, turning them into a zombie.
survivors, characterized by a pink hue, are capable of running five times faster than zombies and sometimes change directions randomly.
if a survivor spots a zombie directly ahead, they promptly turn and flee in panic.
panicked survivors will be distinguishable by their bright pink color and will run twice as fast as other survivors.
a survivor witnessing another panicked survivor will also succumb to panic.
however, a panicked survivor who remains unthreatened for a period of time will eventually calm down.
a suspected north korean drone was discovered by a south korean fisherman near a frontline island south of the disputed sea border between the two countries, as confirmed by military officials.
the wreckage, missing a wing, engine, and camera, was caught in the fisherman's net off baengnyeong island, according to a spokesperson from the south korean defense ministry.
the official noted that the drone shared similarities in shape and color with previously found unmanned aerial vehicles.
earlier in the year, south korea had retrieved crashed drones with cameras in various locations, such as baengnyeong island and paju, a northern border city.
the memory chips of the drones contained images of border areas and seoul, including the presidential palace.
following a collaborative investigation with us experts, seoul asserted that it had obtained compelling evidence verifying that the drones had originated from north korea and were programmed to surveil south korean military installations.
despite these claims, north korea vehemently denied any involvement, accusing the south of manufacturing evidence.
luke yeomans, a 47-year-old man and the owner of a nottinghamshire snake sanctuary, tragically passed away after being bitten by one of his own snakes.
scheduled to unveil the king cobra sanctuary in eastwood to the public that weekend, mr.
yeomans was found at his property on brookhill leys road near eastwood, where authorities suspected he had suffered a heart attack.
the police assured the community that the snake responsible had been secured, eliminating any threat to the public.
emergency services declared the victim deceased on-site.
the rspca, health and safety executive, and broxtowe borough council were promptly notified.
nottinghamshire police initiated an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident.
in a prior bbc interview, mr.
yeomans had revealed his sanctuary's inception in 2008, motivated by the alarming decline of snakes' natural habitats in southeast asia and india.
his lifelong fascination with snakes began at the age of seven when he caught his first adder, and by his teenage years, he cohabited with gaboon vipers and indian cobras in his bedroom.
by 16, he opened a pet shop solely dedicated to snakes and reptiles, embarking on breeding his own within two years.
drawing a parallel between his affection for snakes and others' passion for fast cars, he dismissed critics by asserting his work's inherent goodness.
the prevalence of the 3d trend is undeniable.
asus and msi are showcasing 3d versions of their respective all-in-one pcs at cebit.
although both companies emphasize that these are just concept models for now, asus displayed the 3d eee top with a pair of nvidia-branded glasses nearby, suggesting a potential incorporation of 3d vision into its touchscreen system.
msi allowed attendees to try on large 3d glasses and enjoy a game of left 4 dead in 3d.

detention, especially when it extends beyond six months, can result in severe trauma.
the humid and hot environments of nauru and manus island in papua new guinea have caused significant skin ailments and heightened risks of vector-borne illnesses.
poor sanitation and open water sources greatly elevate the likelihood of disease outbreaks.
one tragic incident on manus island involved a fatality from sepsis triggered by a foot injury.
startling figures reveal alarming mental health issues affecting both adults and children in detention.
the invaluable insights into these dire circumstances stem from my courageous colleagues, dedicated physicians, and pediatricians committed to delivering essential healthcare to detainees in these facilities.
while the ultimate goal is for the closure of these centers to eliminate the need for medical staff within them, currently, it is my committed colleagues who offer crucial medical aid.
despite facing confidentiality agreements meant to enforce their silence upon leaving, they have bravely shed light on the distressing realities within these centers.
the recent enactment of the australian border force act attempts to further suppress public access to truthful information about conditions in immigration detention centers.
sydney is set to miss out on hosting the socceroos' key world cup qualifying match for the third consecutive campaign, as the fixture against japan is anticipated to be played in melbourne.
sources reveal that the game against their asian rivals is likely to take place at the mcg on october 11, rather than sydney's allianz or anz stadium.
the football federation australia had called for bids from state bodies to secure the hosting rights for this significant socceroos' match, and it appears that an agreement in principle has been made with the victorian government and the mcg, with the deal to be finalized shortly.
while an ffa spokesman mentioned that a deal has not been officially reached yet, the nsw government and sydney venues are now unlikely to host the match, as melbourne is set to be granted the hosting rights.
research from the early 1980s revealed concerning trends related to the impacts of parental divorce on american children.
it was found that children in families experiencing multiple divorces tended to have lower academic performance and were perceived as less sociable by their peers.
adolescents living in single-parent or blended families were shown to be three times more likely to require psychological support within a year.
these children were also reported to have more psychological challenges compared to those from homes disrupted by death.
furthermore, following a divorce, children were found to be at a 50% higher risk of developing health issues in comparison to those from intact families.
disturbingly, a significant number of child abuse victims were identified as coming from single-parent households or having connections to drug-ring members.
statistics indicated that children residing in female-headed households faced a significantly heightened risk of violence or fatality, with a tenfold increased likelihood.
additionally, a notable percentage of long-term inmates have a history of growing up in broken homes.
individuals from such backgrounds were nearly twice as likely to attempt suicide in comparison to those from stable family units.
titus bramble, a sunderland footballer, is confronting his third sexual assault accusation.
the 30-year-old, residing in wynyard, teesside, has been charged with indecently touching two women on different occasions in yarm last september.
during a hearing at teesside magistrates' court, it was disclosed that an additional sexual assault charge involving one of the original complainants would be included.
despite refuting the latest allegation, the defender had already pleaded not guilty to the initial two charges.
bramble was absolved of a public urination charge as the prosecution decided not to pursue it.
the matter has been referred to the crown court for trial proceedings, with the date yet to be scheduled.
titus bramble initiated his playing career at ipswich town and subsequently represented newcastle united and wigan athletic.

a little over two years have passed since jon rudin and erin kirby visited the facilities of franconia brewing company in mckinney for a tour.
brewery tours are a common way for brewers of all sizes to engage with customers, share insights, and of course, provide ample beer.
this particular tour took an unexpected turn when a fermenting tank exploded, causing a frenzy of suds to flood the brewery and allegedly resulting in injuries to rudin and kirby.
the incident occurred as the tour group had just exited the fermentation room and entered the walk-in cooler where the finished beer is stored.
a malfunctioning pressure release valve led to the tank's explosion, causing damage to the brewery, including a torn wall and beer-soaked floors.
a video captured by one of the attendees shows the group cautiously exiting the cooler amidst the wreckage, revealing the extent of the destruction, although the audio contains explicit language.
reportedly, one of japan's major organized crime syndicates is said to have divided into rival factions, raising concerns about potential territorial conflicts.
according to japanese media, several prominent members of the kobe yamaguchi-gumi have departed to establish a breakaway faction in central hyogo prefecture.
allegedly, discontent over the financial practices of their former gang leader prompted the splintering.
authorities have indicated heightened vigilance in anticipation of possible violent confrontations.
as the largest among japan's underworld networks, the yamaguchi-gumi gang, recognized as part of the yakuza, boasts approximately 23,000 associates.
within the country, an estimated total of about 60,000 individuals are linked to yakuza groups that, while not illegal themselves, accrue much of their proceeds through illegal means such as gambling, prostitution, drug peddling, and the increasingly prevalent cybercrime.
the emerging faction, self-identified as the ninkyo daintai yamaguchi-gumi, clarified to the media that it would operate sans a singular leader, with representation by yoshinori oda, a 50-year-old former high-ranking member of the original gang.
the kobe yamaguchi-gumi was established two years prior following a schism of influential factions from the primary yamaguchi-gumi organization.
the health and safety executive (hse) is currently investigating a significant data breach at midlands regional hospital in tullamore.
the breach involved the inadvertent faxing of a patient's private information to the office of the data commissioner instead of the intended recipient, the patient's gp.
this breach is part of 212 similar incidents documented by the hse in the previous year and disclosed in the most recent report from the data protection commissioner's office.
among the highlighted incidents is a mishap in drogheda, where a staff member had patient files blown away by the wind while transferring them between two hospital buildings, with two of the pages never being recovered.
in his courageous battle against leukemia over 12 years, cody green exemplified bravery akin to the bravest of warriors.
recognizing his indomitable spirit, he was honored as an honorary marine shortly before his passing.
diagnosed with the illness at just 22 months old, cody found inspiration in the tenacity of the marine corps as he bravely fought his way into remission three times, as reported by wlfi.
despite his valiant efforts, cody's body succumbed to the infection that claimed his life on a saturday.
in a touching display of respect for his unyielding determination, the marines bestowed cody with marine navigator wings and inducted him as an honorary member of the united states marine corps.

in an apparent ambush in eastern democratic republic of congo, rebels killed three indian peacekeepers.
the indian army reported that dozens of machete-wielding men dressed in raffia palms attacked as soldiers were assisting a group of civilians after opening a fortified base.
the attackers are believed to be members of the mai mai militia group, known for contributing to the longstanding violence in the region.
the motive behind the night attack remains unclear, as stated by the indian army.
the incident took place at a base managed by the un's peacekeeping mission, monusco, in the town of kirumba, where a group of five congolese civilians sought assistance.
during a conversation between the civilians and the guards, around 50 rebels launched an assault from the surrounding jungle.
the indian soldiers engaged in a firefight, managing to repel the attackers but not before three soldiers were killed and seven others were wounded.
the monusco mission in congo, which includes nearly 4,000 indian army soldiers, has faced challenges in protecting civilians due to repeated rebel attacks.
chancellor anders blaine made the senate's decision on the succession known from the senate building's steps.
following a historic vote where arissa lavigny-duval received a clear majority, she has been chosen as the next ruler of the empire.
it marks a significant moment as she will become the first female leader of the empire since the colony's establishment on achenar by marlin duval in the 23rd century.
despite this milestone, she will bear the title of 'emperor' instead of 'empress'.
this change was made possible by a ruling made by the late emperor early in his reign, overturning an ancient decree mandating male imperial rulers.
the decision has been widely lauded, with even princess aisling duval expressing her approval.
festivities are expected to last until the upcoming coronation ceremony, although not everyone is in agreement with the senate's choice.
in a statement, emperor's dawn criticized the selection of arissa lavigny-duval as "a desecration of the traditions of the empire" and has threatened to disrupt the ceremony.

talented cult figure anthony mcdonald-tipungwuti made a remarkable comeback on saturday, showcasing his skills by scoring 4 goals in a stellar performance for essendon.
following a series of lackluster games that did not meet the high standards he had set at the beginning of the season, tippa delivered one of his finest displays yet.
while he was prominently involved in the initial surge of scoring opportunities for essendon, his exceptional play was consistent throughout the entire match.
renowned for his speed within the essendon team, he demonstrated his agility by initiating plays from the defensive end and swiftly transitioning to support offensive plays on the other side of the field.
though he narrowly missed a highlight-reel mark over jack hombsch in the goal square, he redeemed himself in the final quarter with a slick move reminiscent of eddie betts.
despite the presence of more prominent players on the essendon roster, tippa stands out with his x factor and is continuously evolving into a more formidable force on the field.
why should we have to choose between brannon and amash in congress?
ideally, we would have numerous candidates similar to ron paul who speak boldly on foreign policy.
however, we live in an imperfect world.
to move closer to this ideal scenario, we need more transitional candidates who embody libertarian values while also navigating the political landscape effectively.
these transitional candidates can pave the way for future straightforward liberty candidates to run successfully.
with continued effort from our current liberty candidates in educating the public, we may eventually reach a point where we no longer need to engage in political maneuvering and careful language.
this is the future i aspire to and actively work towards.
in the hedonistic imperative, the concept is introduced that through advancements in genetic engineering and nanotechnology, there is a potential to eliminate suffering for all sentient beings.
this abolitionist initiative, although exceptionally ambitious, is deemed technically viable, instrumentally logical, and morally imperative.
the current pathways for experiencing pain and discomfort trace back to their aid in advancing genetic fitness within past environments.
these pathways are anticipated to be supplanted by a new neural structure focusing on a motivational system founded on inheritable gradients of happiness.
a future where states of profound well-being are the innate standard for mental health is foreseen.
it is predicted that there will eventually be a definitive end to any unpleasant experiences worldwide.
just two centuries ago, potent synthetic pain-relievers and surgical sedatives were unheard of, and the idea of eradicating physical pain would have sounded preposterous.
now, residents of technologically progressive nations commonly expect the routine absence of physical pain.
similarly, the notion that psychological suffering could also be eradicated might at first seem implausible.
however, the potential for its elimination brings forth questions of societal guidelines and ethical decision-making regarding its intentional preservation.
the crispr genome editing technique is a groundbreaking advancement in genetics.
it offers the possibility of treating diseases by either disrupting genetic code through introducing mutations or repairing genes by eliminating mutations and substituting them with healthy code.
researchers at the third affiliated hospital of guangzhou medical university in china achieved a significant milestone by successfully editing genetic mutations in viable human embryos for the first time.
prior efforts using non-viable embryos, which are typically chosen to address ethical concerns, have not yielded promising results.
initial attempts to repair genes in abnormal embryos had a poor success rate, with less than ten percent of cells being successfully repaired.
a subsequent study also showed a low success rate, underscoring the need for further development of the technique before it can be reliably used in medical settings.
to improve outcomes, the researchers decided to work with viable embryos, collecting immature eggs from donors undergoing ivf treatment that would typically be discarded due to lower chances of successful development.
these eggs were matured and fertilized with sperm from men carrying hereditary diseases for the editing process.
australians are legally entitled to self-defence, yet practical implementation of this right is restricted.
possessing any object intended for self-defence, regardless of lethality, is considered a criminal offense.
the individuals caught in the lindt cafe during the incident were left defenseless, as carrying self-defence tools is prohibited by state regulations.
the perpetrator may have exploited this knowledge during the martin place siege.
are there possibilities that the outcome could have differed if the patrons had access to means of protection?
items banned for self-defence purposes encompass pepper sprays, mace, clubs, and personal tasers.
certain regions prohibit carrying pocket-knives and even wearing bullet-proof vests.
those capable of evading an attacker can legally utilize available items like screwdrivers, kitchen knives, or beer glasses.
however, for those unable to retreat or lacking a suitable countermeasure, their only recourse is to rely on law enforcement.

the distribution of funding favoring charming and appealing endangered animals is a widely recognized phenomenon.
while popular species like the beloved panda deserve conservation efforts, this allocation often sidelines equally significant but less visually appealing species.
consider creatures like the brazilian bald-faced tamarin, resembling a blend of a wild monkey and a bat, or the formidable 10-foot-long komodo dragon that evokes childhood night terrors.
recognizing these overlooked animals, the ugly animal preservation society (uaps) takes a unique approach to conservation.
through a blend of humor and advocacy, this organization raises awareness for less conventionally attractive species like the pig-nosed frog, depicted above, which often struggle to secure funding.
at uaps events, london comedians and scientists collaborate to showcase and shed light on a single unsightly yet critically endangered animal.
audience participation culminates in selecting a mascot for each uaps chapter.
rather than providing direct financial support, the primary goal remains to garner attention and spark interest, ultimately leading to potential donations from other sources.
fort worth residents austin wayne underwood and jessica smith, both in their mid-30s and both with down syndrome, were first brought together due to their shared condition.
underwood's mother, jan, a longtime advocate for children with down syndrome, has been a valuable resource and support system for families facing similar challenges, as reported by fort worth texas magazine.
their connection dates back to when they were 3 years old, and smith's mother reached out to jan, forging a lasting friendship.
over the past three decades, the families have celebrated every christmas together, until 2012 when underwood broke tradition for a special reason.
choosing a unique setting, underwood surprised smith by proposing to her during a limo ride to view christmas lights.
the couple, who have harbored affection for each other since childhood, are now planning a western-themed wedding and are slated to tie the knot this summer.
the nsw greens' main decision-making body is currently reviewing the legitimacy of the recent ballot that resulted in dawn walker being chosen to fill a vacancy in the upper house, sparking a potential challenge to the outcome amidst escalating factional tensions.
in december, dawn walker narrowly won the ballot to take over from retiring upper house member jan barham, besting kelly marks by a mere 13 votes, who is a former staff member of the late greens mlc john kaye.
a report from the returning officers, obtained by fairfax media, has raised concerns about the integrity of the preselection process, prompting a call for the state delegates council to carefully assess these issues and make an informed decision regarding the outcome.

our colleague cj fogler, who captured the video above and created this gif, amusingly compared shaq's actions to that of someone under the influence of acid, as hinted by the gif's url.
nevertheless, we highly doubt shaq was actually on acid, which does not provide much clarity.
perhaps it's best to leave this occurrence as an intriguing enigma.
it seems that jazz highlights have a peculiar effect on people.
utilizing a digital tracking microscope capable of providing precise cell position and orientation data, we conducted a study on the motion of caulobacter crescentus, a fast-swimming bacterium.
contrary to the conventional belief that the rotating flagellum solely propels the cell, our research reveals that when the flagellum exerts force on the cell, the cell body's axis undergoes helical precession, thereby enhancing its motility.
this groundbreaking discovery reshapes our understanding of the interplay between cell shape, motion, and bacterial motility.
with our innovative cell tracking methodology, we can delve into a diverse array of investigations requiring prolonged observation of individual cells, such as motility dynamics, cellular behavior, and aging processes.
using our advanced digital tracking technique in conjunction with 3d reconstructions, we were able to track the 3d trajectory and orientation of individual caulobacter crescentus cells over extended periods.
our findings indicate that these cells exhibit two distinct motility modes based on the flagellar motor's rotation direction.
in the forward mode, where the flagellum propels the cell, the cell body tilts and precesses in a helical trajectory, enhancing motility.
conversely, in the reverse mode, where the flagellum pulls the cell, the precession is reduced, resulting in lower translation distance per rotation period and decreased motility.
our analysis, using resistive force theory, elucidates how the helical motion of the cell body generates thrust and accounts for the directional variations in swimming motility.
the cell body's precession is linked to the flexibility of the flagellum-to-cell body hook, indicating its role in this phenomenon.
at its national officers conference this week, the electrical trades union surprised many by choosing a greens federal mp to open the event instead of a representative from the labor party, in a break from tradition.
adam bandt, the greens treasury spokesman, is set to be the guest speaker on the first day of the etu's two-day conference in adelaide, beginning on tuesday.
the move to invite a greens mp to address the conference for the first time is significant, particularly in light of the ongoing political dynamics.
this decision follows tensions between the greens and labor in melbourne ports, sparked by remarks from labor mp michael danby regarding preferences.
notably, the etu's previous clash with labor over the china-australia free trade agreement has possibly influenced this new direction.
bandt is expected to provide a sneak peek into the greens' upcoming energy policy, scheduled for release this sunday.
john lloyd and sarah millican are hosting this episode joined by rufus hound, a comedian from argumental, sir tim smit, the founder of the eden project, and doris vickers, a prominent archaeoastronomer from austria.
the guest lineup includes rufus hound, a versatile personality known for his comedy, acting, political involvement, and winning strictly come dancing.
sir tim smit, a former music producer turned gardener who discovered the lost gardens of heligan and established the eden project.
lastly, doris vickers, a scholar with a background in astronomy who developed a passion for latin and now combines both fields as an archaeoastronomer from vienna.
the discussions revolve around topics such as primitive time-telling methods before clocks, the potential transformation of politics through the mandatory use of lie-detecting suits, and the exploration of human nature through mirror-induced simian behavior.
the episode was meticulously researched by anne miller and stevyn colgan of qi, produced by richard turner and james harkin, and was a bbc radio comedy production.
the 6'1, 236-pound player has had one carry for nine yards so far this season.
although he has yet to make a catch as a longhorn, there was a commitment from a member of the coaching staff that he would receive the first touch against notre dame in the opening game.
despite missing the iowa state game due to a football injury, mcneal appears to be back to full health.
with play caller jay norvell expressing dissatisfaction with the blocking effort and senior leadership of the team, he has promised to involve more young players, suggesting that mcneal might get more opportunities in the upcoming game against kansas.
if texas manages to establish an early lead, norvell could find it easier to justify giving more playing time to the freshmen and sophomores.
mcneal, a highly regarded four-star prospect from high school, was ranked as the nation's no.
20 athlete by the 247sports composite rankings.
his commitment to texas alongside his mesquite poteet teammate malik jefferson in december played a crucial role in the impressive finish to the 2015 recruiting class.
the liberal democrats presented their own "alternative budget" in the house of commons as a deliberate move to distinguish themselves from the conservatives within the coalition.
however, the event quickly descended into chaos.
despite alexander beginning his speech with only six backbenchers in attendance, and two secretaries of state from the party failing to show up, the most notable absence was the departure of a prominent figure, clegg, before the conclusion.
labour mps even mockingly escorted him out, with chris leslie remarking it was likely his final appearance in the commons.
hamilton has reported an increase in raccoon rabies cases, with four new cases, bringing the total to 10 within the last three weeks.
the ministry of natural resources and forestry is taking preventive measures by distributing vaccine baits across a wide area in and around hamilton to contain the spread of the disease.
these cases mark the first instances of raccoon rabies in ontario in more than ten years.
authorities anticipate uncovering additional cases in the vicinity as the situation unfolds.
the outbreak came to attention following an incident where two dogs engaged with an infected raccoon at an animal services van.
both dogs are presently under quarantine post receiving vaccinations against the virus.
in an industrial zone in melbourne's western region, a territorial dispute has led a concrete and quarrying company to isolate a portion of a significant bike path.
this action compels cyclists to reroute through congested suburban streets.
the barro group, a well-established family-owned enterprise with various construction ventures in melbourne and other states, has installed barriers along the federation trail in hoppers crossing.
the contentious issue arose when the trail intersected one of its properties.
meanwhile, in werribee, another family has blocked a neighboring bike path, asserting it falls within their property boundaries.
vicroads has set up provisional diversion signs on nearby roads following the sudden closure of the path.
as of thursday, the department provided no explanation for the abrupt blockade or confirmation on the removal of the barriers.
consequently, an area of the trail adjacent to skeleton creek, north of old geelong road, remains inaccessible to the public indefinitely.
john gibbons, the manager of the toronto blue jays, has disclosed to mlb network radio's jim duquette and jim bowden that the team is in discussions with the oakland athletics about a potential trade involving starting pitcher rich hill.
besides hill, gibbons revealed that the blue jays are also exploring other starting pitcher options before the august 1 deadline.
he expressed interest in several prominent pitchers who are available in the market.
gibbons stated, "i think we are in on everybody everyone else is." this declaration aligns with previous reports indicating that the blue jays have intensified their pursuit of a starting pitcher recently, as per espn's jayson stark.
considering the limited innings of the emerging starter aaron sanchez, toronto is under pressure to secure another pitcher to fill the void left by the impressive 24-year-old in the starting rotation.
indonesia is currently undertaking a massive vaccination campaign to combat a significant diphtheria outbreak that has led to numerous fatalities, officials reported on monday.
approximately eight million children and teenagers nationwide are set to receive vaccinations this week to curb the spread of the disease, stemming from a bacterial infection.
diphtheria poses severe health risks, including respiratory issues, heart complications, paralysis, and, in worst-case scenarios, death if left untreated.
while widespread instances of this communicable illness are uncommon in indonesia, the country had the second-highest number of reported cases globally from 2011 to 2015, trailing only india as per the world health organization.
this year, indonesia has recorded close to 600 diphtheria cases in 95 communities spread across 20 provinces, resulting in 32 fatalities.
the vaccination drive kicked off in three densely populated provinces, including jakarta, this week and might extend into the coming month.
health authorities attribute the surge in cases to poor public awareness and the rise of anti-vaccination sentiments in indonesia.
aiming to prevent further outbreaks before the upcoming asian games, officials emphasize the importance of vaccination.
reflecting on the inoculation process, 10-year-old student ragil setiawan from tangerang expressed no fear, mentioning that his teacher had explained the necessity of immunization and that the shot was painless.

the frequency of trains on this particular line is notably sparse, with trains only running every 22 minutes during peak hours, which is among the poorest service levels experienced on melbourne's suburban rail network.
commuters using the altona loop face an additional challenge as metro occasionally decides to skip the line due to delays, resulting in passengers being unexpectedly stranded for up to an hour.
jennifer williams from the altona station, which operates on a single-track railway, expresses her frustration, stating, "it's highly unreliable, making it uncertain if a train will be available." according to williams, who represents the altona loop group, the extended intervals between trains are primarily due to the single-track nature of the loop, restricting train frequency to a maximum of three per hour and leading to service disruptions even from minor delays.
on may 17, 1968, a group of nine individuals made a bold statement by entering the selective service offices in catonsville, maryland.
they proceeded to remove and burn several hundred draft records using homemade napalm as a form of protest against the vietnam war.
their actions led to their arrest and subsequent sentencing in a high-profile trial.
this act of civil disobedience sparked widespread debate not only in maryland but also across the united states, fueling anti-war sentiments and garnering strong reactions from the public.
among the group, the priest brothers daniel and philip berrigan received particular attention, thrusting them into the national spotlight.
the catonsville demonstration not only epitomized the spirit of the antiwar movement of 1968 but also encapsulated the broader social changes that were unfolding in american society during the 1960s.
this webpage serves as a valuable resource for individuals interested in delving into the details of this significant event in maryland's history, a project endorsed by the mdch advisory committee.

a funding request to repair a deteriorating seawall in eastern cape breton was recently denied by the federal government.
the seawall, located in the gabarus community, has sustained damage from storms over the years, leading to concerns about potential risks to nearby homes.
acting fisheries minister gail shea informed gabarus residents in a letter that the responsibility for the seawall falls under the provincial government's jurisdiction, not the federal government's.
tim menk from the friends of gabarus community group emphasized the need for ottawa to take ownership of the seawall to prevent further delays in decision-making, indicating that legal action may be pursued if necessary.
a recent report from the department of natural resources classified the repair or replacement of the 65-year-old seawall as an urgent matter.
meanwhile, gabarus has initiated the construction of a new fire hall funded by the community, symbolizing their commitment to the area's long-term sustainability.
menk expressed confidence in the community's future despite the potential consequences of not repairing the seawall in a timely manner.
previous instances of flooding, such as one caused by an earthquake in 1929, underscore the importance of maintaining the seawall, which was originally built by the federal government in the 1940s and underwent repairs in the 1980s.
each nation's unique customs, laws, and institutions are integral to its identity and should be honed and consolidated accordingly.
nations should cultivate associations that promote unity and enhance their shared experiences.
just as animals align with their own kind, nations should forge bonds with individuals of the same background and language, fostering harmony and open communication.
this natural affinity facilitates camaraderie, understanding, and peaceful coexistence.
in contrast, embracing unfamiliar customs and laws may breed discord, animosity, and division, overshadowing potential for friendship and collaboration.
according to deadline, fox is in the process of developing a television series based on ea's battlefield: bad company.
remembered for its distinct focus on a vibrant single-player storyline rather than multiplayer battles, the game stood out for its humorous elements like the grenade with a smiley face pin.
the planned show is expected to be an action-comedy adaptation titled bad company, created by john eisendrath, known for his work on alias, in collaboration with sony tv and happy madison.
the series will follow the original game's main characters - four rebellious soldiers transitioning from military service to the private sector.
however, their past catches up with them when they discover their former commanding officer had manipulated them for the benefit of a secretive government faction and is now targeting them for elimination.
eisendrath will serve as the writer and executive producer alongside happy madison's doug robinson, as well as ea's patrick bach and patrick o'brien.
brazil nuts are a calorie-dense food, with a 1-ounce serving containing 186 calories and nearly 19 grams of total fat, which equates to approximately six nuts.
consuming excess brazil nuts may lead to a high intake of calories and fat, potentially resulting in weight gain and health issues such as high blood pressure and diabetes if this trend persists.
despite the high fat content, it's worth noting that the majority of the fat in brazil nuts is unsaturated, which could have a positive impact on cholesterol levels when replacing saturated or trans fats in your diet.
to maintain a balanced diet, it is recommended that total fat intake should not exceed 25 to 35 percent of total daily calories.
for a 2,000-calorie diet, this translates to consuming between 56 and 77 grams of total fat per day, with a serving of brazil nuts accounting for 25 to 34 percent of this daily fat requirement.
reuters recently commissioned a group of photographers to document a generation in distress.
the resulting series showcases portraits of worldwide graduates struggling to secure employment in their respective fields, settling instead for underpaid service sector roles.
while their current circumstances may be disheartening, the individuals depicted in these photographs may consider themselves fortunate simply to be employed.
according to the international labor organization, nearly 75 million individuals between the ages of 15 and 24 are currently without work.
spanning from a civil engineering graduate working as a cook in athens to a corporate finance master's degree holder employed as a waiter in algiers, these young adults have invested years in rigorous education to meet the demands of the modern era, only to realize that prestigious qualifications hold little value in a distressed global market.
istanbul was left reeling on saturday evening due to a shift in crowd-control tactics employed by the turkish police.
despite the chaos, there were no fatalities, only a handful of injuries, and less than 40 arrests, as a large crowd of demonstrators attempted unsuccessfully to breach the police barriers and gain access to central taksim square.
the demonstrators sought to occupy not only the square but also adjacent gezi park, the site of a violent police crackdown a year earlier that had triggered widespread anger nationwide.
the protests, which had commenced peacefully on may 31, 2013, initially aimed to thwart government plans to redevelop the park into a shopping mall.
however, the heavy-handed police response fueled dissent against the government on various fronts, leading to the deaths of eight protesters and injuring thousands.
on that saturday, an estimated 30,000 police officers, some in plain clothes, were transported from different regions to encircle the square and block all access points before any protesters could reach their destination.

the primary purpose of this finance application is to serve as a user-friendly tool for managing various payments like those for housing, vehicles, and phones.
the concept originated from my personal experience of creating a spreadsheet to monitor my car payments and streamline my budgeting process.
consequently, realizing the inconvenience of relying solely on a laptop for this task, i decided to develop an app that offers flexibility and accessibility.
the initial version of the app will prompt users to name their payment and input the corresponding amount owed.
subsequently, a form will enable users to record their payments systematically, mirroring the organization of a spreadsheet.
the app will display the outstanding balance, the progress percentage, and the proportion of each payment relative to the initial amount.
automatic updates will occur following each addition or deletion of a payment entry.
future updates are slated to introduce additional functionalities and performance metrics.
manager martin o'neill has selected four preston north end players to the provisional republic of ireland squad for the upcoming world cup qualifiers against georgia and serbia next month.
alan browne, daryl horgan, greg cunningham, and sean maguire have all been included in the 39-man provisional squad.
among them, sean maguire receives his first call-up, having showcased his talent in two impressive showings for north end and a remarkable run of form at cork city prior to joining pne.
additionally, alan browne and daryl horgan retain their spots in the squad, while greg cunningham makes a return to the national team after four years, owing to his consistent performances in the championship over the past two seasons.
browne earned his senior debut against mexico in june, while horgan made his first appearance against iceland in march at the aviva stadium.
the republic of ireland is set to face georgia on saturday, september 2, followed by a home match against serbia on tuesday, september 5.
at present, o'neill's squad holds the second position in group d after registering three wins and three draws in the fifa world cup qualifiers.
a recent study published in the journal of women's health suggests that red wine may play a significant role in breast cancer prevention.
the study revealed that women who consumed slightly under two servings of red wine daily experienced hormonal changes resembling those induced by a drug used to prevent the recurrence of malignant breast tumors.
interestingly, the same hormonal effects were not observed in premenopausal women who consumed an equivalent amount of white wine.
despite previous cautions regarding alcohol intake and breast cancer risk, with recent studies indicating that as few as three weekly alcohol servings could elevate the likelihood of developing the disease, it is worth noting that white wine and other alcoholic beverages are believed to facilitate the conversion of androgens (male hormones like testosterone present in all women) into estrogen.
this conversion, leading to increased estrogen exposure over a woman's lifetime, be it from endogenous or exogenous sources, is associated with higher breast cancer risk.
in court, aaron barley, aged 23 and with no fixed address, faced charges for the brutal murders of tracey wilkinson, 50, and her 13-year-old son pierce in their greyhound lane residence in stourbridge, west midlands.
peter wilkinson, pierce's father, was also a victim of a vicious assault and is currently hospitalized.
barley appeared at birmingham crown court, where he was remanded in custody without bail, and it was noted that a trial was scheduled for the autumn, expected to last approximately two weeks.
the tragic incident prompted a visit to the family home by lydia wilkinson, the daughter of the victims and sister to pierce, who shared her profound grief over the loss of her mother and brother, describing them as beloved individuals.
she expressed that pierce was a cheerful and kind young boy, while mrs.
wilkinson was a nurturing and exceptional mother and daughter, as she tenderly laid floral tributes at the residence.
digg, the esteemed social news platform that has experienced a decline in traffic, is primed for a revival as the company renews its focus on enhancing and expanding its services, according to digg founder kevin rose.
during the techcrunch disrupt conference in san francisco, rose highlighted that in response to economic challenges in 2008, digg diverted its efforts towards revenue generation, redirecting engineers from product development.
this shift led to a period of stagnation in innovation for approximately 18 months, causing a loss of user interest and benefiting competitors.
rose acknowledged that the emergence of platforms like twitter and facebook had eroded digg's traffic, emphasizing the need for innovative strategies to differentiate itself.
looking ahead, digg aims to revamp its approach by placing a stronger emphasis on content recommendation.
this shift intends to re-engage existing users and attract new ones by offering personalized content suggestions based on users' interests, as rose shared his vision for the platform's future trajectory.
by tailoring content recommendations to individual preferences, rose envisions a significant increase in traffic volume, potentially growing digg's current user base of 20 million unique visitors per month by multiples.
the issue of land rights becomes a key factor in this situation, as the saudis, being the landowners, are seen to be abiding by the established regulations.
the specific area in the arizona desert where the saudis purchased land lacks significant regulations concerning groundwater usage, unlike the rest of the state where about 85 percent of the territory is subject to strict groundwater management rules.
over the recent years, local development activities and groundwater extraction have led to a substantial decline in the groundwater levels, especially in la paz county, located 130 miles west of phoenix, with some areas experiencing a drop of over 50 feet since 2010.
records indicate that alamarai's subsidiary, fondomonte arizona, controls a significant number of water wells totaling at least 23, each having the capacity to pump more than 100,000 gallons per day.
according to michelle moreno, a spokesperson for the arizona department of water resources, the current regulations allow unrestricted water usage as long as it serves a beneficial purpose, without the requirement of reporting the volume of water utilized.
in response to concerns raised by residents, the department has arranged a public meeting scheduled for january 30 in la paz county to address the community's worries.
davenport - the quad cities' summer music festival is undergoing a transformation with a new name and fresh appeal.
alternating currents festival will replace the well-known river roots live event, which used to be combined with ribfest.
now, ribfest is joining street fest, while the music will be moved indoors at the festival.
the revamp will also introduce stand-up comedy acts, film screenings, and visual artists to the lineup, enhancing the overall entertainment experience.
the festival will feature over 50 local and national acts, with the official lineup set to be announced later this spring.

the reimagined festival is expected to draw more attention to downtown davenport, offering attendees a diverse range of activities to enjoy and explore.
the dates for the festival will remain the same, set for august 26th and 27th.

the classification board has prohibited the screening of the feature film, "i want your love," which contains graphic portrayals of gay male intimacy.
the movie, crafted by emerging american filmmaker travis mathews, had been intended for presentation at various queer film festivals across australia.
mathews recently collaborated with renowned actor james franco on "interior: leather bar," a film showcased at the prestigious sundance festival.
this collaboration served as a reimagining of the contentious 1980s movie, "cruising," starring al pacino.
described as overly explicit, the ban has precluded "i want your love" from participating in australian film festivals, even though such festivals typically receive exemptions from the classification process.
festival organizers provide summaries of the featured works for review, enabling the board to request screenings of individual films as needed.
lisa daniel, director of the melbourne queer film festival, expressed surprise at this denial of exemption, noting it as a first in the festival's 15-year history.
despite the film's successful screenings at numerous international festivals, distributors have confirmed that this ban marks the first of its kind.
given mathews' established reputation as a filmmaker, the decision has been termed as a setback for australia, highlighting an unexpected hurdle in the country's film curation landscape.
"in the donetsk sector, the occupants engaged ukrainian fortified positions near the village of verkhniotoretske using automatic grenade launchers and machine guns.

the ato hq further indicated that two more soldiers lost their lives and one was injured in a similar manner in the donetsk sector.
the navy recently ended the suspension of a shipping contractor based in dubai, inchcape shipping services, amidst an ongoing investigation for possible fraud, enabling the company to bid for new contracts.
as part of the agreement, the company has committed to funding an independent audit to assist the justice department in determining potential overcharges to the government.
this decision followed a federal judge's query about the adequacy of evidence supporting the suspension.
notably, observers view the engagement of an external auditor in such cases as unusual, with concerns raised about the audit's thoroughness compared to an internal investigation.
the auditing firm selected must receive approval from the justice department, which is conducting a civil fraud inquiry into alleged systematic overcharging by inchcape for supplying provisions and sewage-removal services to navy vessels in the middle east and africa.
officials believe that the audit could facilitate settlement discussions between inchcape and the justice department.
oregon's recruiting efforts this summer have yielded impressive results, with the addition of six new recruits in just eleven days.
the latest commitments include safety pj locke from beaumont, texas, who announced his decision to join the ducks shortly after travis waller's commitment.
locke, standing at 5'10 and weighing 189 lbs, is recognized as a 3-star recruit by recruiting services, despite having the offer list of a 4-star player.
alongside oregon, locke received offers from top programs such as baylor, georgia, missouri, michigan state, notre dame, stanford, and ucla, among others.
notably, his academic prowess also attracted interest from esteemed institutions like duke, northwestern, and yale.
locke's commitment marks oregon's 11th overall verbal agreement and the second in the defensive backfield, where he will be joining jihree stewart.
the reputation of oregon's defensive back development, led by coach john neal, is stellar, with a track record of sending players to the nfl.
locke's skill set, showcased in his highlight reel, exhibits a combination of ball-hawking prowess and physicality that aligns with the standards of defensive backs at oregon.
the optimism surrounding locke's potential success at oregon is high, given the program's history of nurturing talent in the position.
our two-year-old adores giraffes, so we decided to get this adorable stuffed animal as a gift for him.
as soon as he laid eyes on it, he gave it a warm hug and named it yellow.
ever since, he carries yellow around the house, and they have become inseparable playmates.
despite being nearly as tall as him, he finds it easy to tote around.
yellow has quickly become his go-to toy, and at bedtime, he insists on having yellow tucked in right next to him by mom and dad.
although initially concerned about yellow's stiffness for sleeping, our son doesn't seem bothered at all.
while we'd love to give it a perfect rating, the construction could be improved as we discovered a small hole in the fabric that doesn't seem to be due to stress.
we worry it may worsen in time, leading to yellow's retirement.
but if that happens, we'll gladly purchase another one!

tor traffic is easily identifiable and can be blocked, which is why skypemorph was created as a solution.
this innovative system covertly disguises tor traffic to appear as skype video traffic.
by employing traffic shaping techniques, skypemorph transforms tor packets into user datagram protocol packets used by skype, imitating the packet sizes and timing of typical skype video conversations.
this makes it difficult for network analysts to distinguish tor traffic from genuine skype video data, thereby enhancing privacy.
the selection of skype as the disguise was strategic due to its global popularity, making it challenging for authorities to restrict its usage without facing widespread backlash.
additionally, the developers opted for skype's video feature as it aligns more closely with tor traffic characteristics compared to voice calls, where noticeable transmission pauses occur during conversations.
criminalization of sex work extends beyond just prohibiting the sale of sexual services to also encompass laws against solicitation, living off earnings from sex work, brothel-keeping, and purchasing sexual services.
this restrictive legal framework undermines sex workers' autonomy to negotiate condom use, advocate for fair treatment, and demand their rights, consequently heightening their vulnerability to violence, exploitation, and health hazards.
this document outlines ten compelling reasons why decriminalizing sex work is essential for safeguarding the health and human rights of sex workers, their families, and communities.
by decriminalizing sex work, it not only acknowledges sex work as a legitimate form of labor but also ensures the protection of sex workers' rights through the implementation of workplace health and safety regulations.
the removal of criminal sanctions against sex work is pivotal in destigmatizing the profession, reducing social marginalization, and mitigating the constant threat of violence.

charged with the murder of greenisland pensioner eddie girvan, a 29-year-old woman named margaret henderson, whose address was disclosed as verner street in belfast, appeared in court.
henderson faced allegations regarding the death of mr.
girvan, 67, who was discovered deceased in his station road residence by the authorities on monday evening, revealing bound hands and a chest stab wound.
a defense barrister described the defendant as an "extremely vulnerable lady" with intricate requirements, highlighting her fragility and susceptibility to external influences.

girvan's death were unconditionally released on thursday.
for this project, i devised a structure for the pegasus knights where they are organized into groups of ten members each, consisting of five blue-clad and five red-clad knights.
the rationale behind this choice lies in the challenges posed by communication within large squads during aerial combat scenarios.
by dividing the knights into two units of five, with a designated commander leading each group, i aimed to address this issue effectively.
the distinction in colors serves a dual purpose: blue units primarily target ground threats, whereas red units focus on airborne adversaries.
this division of roles enables one unit to provide cover for the other, ensuring a coordinated approach to engaging different types of threats.
each knight understands their specific role within the group, fostering seamless teamwork.
additionally, the visual contrast between cordelia's red outfit and the blue attire of her allied units creates a striking and cohesive aesthetic.
i have outlined the composition of the squad cordelia fights alongside.
please share your feedback and suggestions for potential enhancements.

following the 2008 financial crisis, governments have attempted to bolster their economies through various strategies, primarily by manipulating interest rates downward via quantitative easing and printing money.
while these interventions were crucial initially, their prolonged application over nearly seven years has led to unintended repercussions.
this approach has exacerbated income inequality worldwide, as money channeled through artificially low rates has incentivized speculation over savings and long-term investments crucial for sustainable economic and employment growth.
the federal reserve, monitoring inflation indicators for policy adjustments, may need to reevaluate its strategy.
although its policies have proven effective in targeted areas, the low interest rates have not yielded widespread economic improvement or enhanced the well-being of most individuals.
in reality, such policies might have potentially disadvantaged certain demographic groups.
according to the women's league of burma, despite the establishment of a nominally civilian government in 2010, the military in burma has persisted in using rape as a tool of warfare.
the organization has documented over 100 cases, with some involving children as young as eight years old.
the majority of these assaults occurred in regions where the military was engaged in combat with armed ethnic groups.
the burmese government, also called myanmar, has disavowed the use of rape as a military strategy and encouraged reporting of such incidents.
the reported cases were primarily associated with the conflicts in the border areas of kachin and northern shan state.
the women's league of burma highlighted that many cases involved gang rapes, leading to the death of 28 women, and stated that the widespread and systematic nature of these attacks points to a structured pattern where rape is utilized as a means of warfare and subjugation by the military.
while presidential spokesperson ye htut denied that rape was sanctioned by the military, the women's league of burma's report emphasizes that sexual violence has been used by the burmese military to intimidate and oppress ethnic populations.
despite significant political reforms since the 2010 elections, including the shift from military rule to a military-backed civilian government under president thein sein, reports indicate that the military's operating practices have not significantly changed.
talks scheduled later this month aim to establish a comprehensive cease-fire in all of burma's ethnic conflicts.
experiencing the natural bushland close to home, particularly at the clothing-optional section of kambah pools, is a quintessentially canberran pastime.
for nearly five decades, this stretch along the murrumbidgee river in the south of canberra has welcomed those keen on embracing naturism.
while the notion of public nudity might unsettle some, a representative from the act nudist club mentioned that kambah pools provides a welcoming environment for newcomers to explore this lifestyle.
he noted, "individuals approach us with varying levels of experience, some stepping into nudism for the first time at kambah pools.
it's common for people to initially try it out as a one-time experience, only to discover a newfound comfort in shedding their clothes." embrace your stepchildren's interests as they can lead to new shared activities that bring you closer.
for instance, i discovered the joy of playing just dance on the wii with my stepdaughter, which i may not have experienced otherwise.
by taking an interest in her love for fashion, i found joy in exploring stores through her eyes.
it's important to reciprocate curiosity, so if you have a passion like tennis or horseback riding and they show interest, give it a try together.
you may just gain a new hobby companion.
establishing shared rituals is essential – my stepdaughter and i make time for breakfast together due to our busy schedules.
this daily routine allows us to connect, especially in the mornings when she is most talkative and seeks advice.
building a strong step-relationship requires effort from both the parent and child involved.

on friday, a spokesperson for kerri kasem stated that the remains of renowned radio personality casey kasem have gone missing.
following kasem's death on june 15, his body was kept at a funeral home in tacoma, wash., for over a month.
to the dismay of kerri, it was discovered on thursday that the body had been removed without any notification of its new location or the individual responsible for the transfer.
the gaffney funeral home corroborated the disappearance of kasem's body to buzzfeed but refrained from disclosing the new whereabouts.
speculation has arisen, with a family representative hinting at kasem's widow, jean kasem, as a potential figure linked to the disappearance.
the family rift between jean and kasem's offspring, highlighted by the publicized events in may when casey went missing but was later located in washington, adds a concerning dimension to this perplexing situation.
located on cape breton island in nova scotia, canada, summer weekends are bustling with square dances and events on the island.
one of the main attractions is the annual celtic colours international music festival that celebrates the region's gaelic music heritage.
among other festivals in the area, there is a lively "pig and whistle" gathering and off-road mud rallies, where participants tackle large puddles.
in the small cape breton town of whycocomagh, home to roughly 400 residents, a significant portion of the population is retired.
the town's iconic general store, the farmer's daughter, owned by sisters sandee maclean and heather coulombe, experiences high demand for help in the summer months when school is out.
to entice workers to stay longer, the sisters posted a help wanted ad on facebook offering two acres of land on their family's 250-acre property to anyone who commits to five years of employment.
the only cost involved for the new hires would be the deed transfer fee, typically estimated at a few thousand dollars.
the obama administration announced on tuesday that cuban citizens will now be permitted to work in the united states and receive salaries from american companies.
this decision has the potential to significantly impact how major league teams engage with cuban baseball players.
effective starting wednesday, the new guidelines allow franchises to directly sign contracts with cuban ballplayers.
previously, players from cuba had to defect before being eligible to sign with a major league team.
the signings will comply with the longstanding american embargo as long as the salaries are paid directly to the players without any funds going to the cuban government.
the willingness of cuba to agree to this arrangement for players remaining in the country remains uncertain.
while there may not be an immediate surge in signings from within cuba, these new regulations are poised to bring about substantial changes to the signing process for players who have already defected or may do so in the future.
the credit for the image of the cylindrical mountains on venus goes to the magellan spacecraft team, usgs, and nasa.
large cylindrical mountains, such as the 500-kilometer wide atete corona in the galindo region of venus, are known as coronas.
this image was constructed using a combination of radar maps to generate a computer-generated three-dimensional view.
the dark rectangles running from top to bottom in the image are artifacts of the imaging process and not real features.
the origin of these massive coronas remains under investigation, with theories suggesting they may be the result of volcanism.
by studying these structures on venus, researchers hope to gain insights about the internal composition of both venus and earth.
three kangaroos, one of which was a foetal joey, were found dead, mutilated, and abandoned in a suburban area of melbourne.
local resident robert bishop came across the disturbing scene near his home in lysterfield south, close to churchill national park.
mr bishop recounted how he heard a commotion of men assaulting the kangaroos during the early hours of wednesday.
expressing disbelief and shock, mr bishop expressed to aap on monday his confusion over the senseless act of cruelty.
upon investigating the noise outside prompted by a loud sound, he witnessed a group of six young men attacking a kangaroo with a large blade.
unable to confront them physically, mr bishop shouted at them before seeking help by calling the police.
after the men departed, he documented the gruesome scene with photographs, showing the disemboweled kangaroos, including a decapitated foetal joey.
these photos were shared with the authorities for investigation, as both victoria police and the rspca are actively looking into the matter.
insufficient oxygen availability at high altitudes leads to heightened oxidative stress, resulting in hippocampal neurodegeneration and memory deficits.
though oxidative stress is a primary contributor to neurodegeneration in hypoxic conditions, the potential of quercetin, a flavonoid recognized for its potent antioxidant properties, in reversing hypoxia-induced memory impairment has not been extensively explored.
a study involved four groups of adult male sprague dawley rats exposed to hypobaric hypoxia for 7 days at 7600 meters altitude in a decompression chamber.
the rats received oral quercetin supplementation during the hypoxic exposure period.
spatial working memory was evaluated using a morris water maze before and after hypoxic exposure, while assessments of oxidative stress markers, caspase 3 expression, and neurodegeneration indicators in the hippocampus were conducted.
results revealed that quercetin supplementation during hypobaric hypoxia reduced reactive oxygen species levels and lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus by enhancing antioxidant defenses and the free radical scavenging enzyme system.
additionally, there was a decrease in caspase 3 expression and a reduction in the number of apoptotic neurons in the hippocampus following quercetin supplementation during hypoxia.
behavioral analyses demonstrated that quercetin effectively reversed hypoxia-induced memory impairments.
these findings suggest that quercetin confers neuroprotection to hippocampal neurons under hypobaric hypoxic conditions through its antioxidative and anti-apoptotic properties, displaying promising therapeutic potential for alleviating hypoxia-induced memory dysfunction.

the photograph depicts a piece of equipment found among the contents of a hijacked truck.
in mexico, a united nations vehicle transporting radioactive materials, intended for a waste storage facility, was stolen on monday during its journey from tijuana.
according to the international atomic energy agency, the truck was transporting cobalt 60, a vital component in cancer radiotherapy.
the incident occurred in tepojaco, where the iaea highlighted the severe danger posed by the substance if its protective shielding is compromised.
following the theft, the truck was located near its original theft location on wednesday, confirmed juan eibenschutz, director of the national commission of nuclear safety and safeguards.
eibenschutz noted that the truck's cargo container was empty, with the cobalt 60 discovered about half a mile away.
reassuringly, he conveyed that no immediate threat exists to the local population.
in this blast from the past feature, let's rewind seven years to 2010 when dave focused on training his triceps.
in the video footage, dave demonstrates a challenging routine known as triceps hell and details the specific protocol he follows.
the intense set kicks off with dave lifting a 275-pound bar with a close grip.
he performs five reps to the one-board level before transitioning to the two-board for another five reps.
this progression continues up to the five-board.
once dave completes five reps at each board, he reverses the sequence, starting from the four-board down to the one-board.
the final tally for his set comprises: one-board: 275x5, two-board: 275x5, three-board: 275x5, four-board: 275x5, five-board: 275x5, four-board: 275x5, three-board: 275x2, two-board: 275x1, one-board: 275x1, totaling 34 reps at 275 pounds.
post-set, dave elaborates on the triceps hell routine, noting that the typical protocol involves ascending the boards from one to five and concluding the set there.
however, on this particular occasion, feeling exceptionally strong, dave opted to descent back down the boards, decreasing the reps from five to doubles and ending with a single rep on the last board.
according to a jordanian source, clashes occurred between jordanian and syrian security forces in a border region between the two countries.
the conflict erupted following reports of syrian troops firing at syrian refugees attempting to cross into jordan on friday night.
the source, who requested anonymity, confirmed that the syrian side initiated the firing across the border, leading to a skirmish.
fortunately, there were no reported casualties on the jordanian side.
a syrian opposition activist, identified as abdallah, witnessed the conflict in the tel shihab-turra area, approximately 80km north of amman.
abdallah stated that armored vehicles were engaged in the clash after syrian refugees sought to enter jordan, prompting the syrians to fire in pursuit.
the situation escalated with jordanian armored vehicles targeting two syrian border guard outposts.
abdallah mentioned that the fierce combat lasted for about an hour, with sporadic confrontations following.
this incident marked the most severe clash between the two nations since the uprising against president bashar al-assad began in syria 17 months ago.
border patrols from jordan have previously fired warning shots to deter syrian forces from targeting fleeing refugees.
notably, the border shared between syria and jordan has served as an escape route for assad's opponents, including recent defector prime minister riad hijab.
following this comic, it's tempting to make a witty remark about the state of healthcare, although i don't possess the expertise to do so.
pandora's unexpected appearance during that moment shouldn't have shocked sarah much.
pandora was aware that the spell had been cast, managed to piece together that sarah had essentially swapped bodies with carol, and could silently observe the situation without detection.
nevertheless, sarah was understandably preoccupied with conversing with a powerful, eerie little girl hovering above her bed, hence momentarily overlooking the obvious connection.
originally, i anticipated it would take longer for the events to unfold!
the inclusion of pandora's cryptic question mark was meant as her way of teasing sarah without giving any real hints, but i assumed it would take more time for it to be noticed.
however, considering the complexity of the ongoing plot, i recognized that solely focusing on story-related content in the main comics would lead to a lengthy wait for significant developments.
having previously explored canon material in egs:np, i decided to delve deeper.
moving forward, there will be more instances of this, alongside non-canon content, standalone jokes, and more.
given the myriad characters and plotlines presently unfolding, incorporating canon elements in egs:np is an exciting prospect for me.
while some might not share my enthusiasm, and i've received some skeptical reactions, i remain enthusiastic about this direction.
approximately 100 activists in ukraine's capital, kiev, defiantly organized the country's inaugural gay pride parade despite a court injunction.
olena semenova, one of the organizers, hailed the event as a milestone, while acknowledging the prevailing homophobia in the society.
amid a heavy police presence, the protesters staged the march outside the city center as 13 individuals were detained by the authorities for attempting to disrupt the demonstration.
meanwhile, in moscow, over 20 gay rights activists were arrested during an unauthorized rally outside russia's parliament to protest against recent legislation targeting the lgbtq+ community.
the contentious bill, ostensibly designed to safeguard children by prohibiting "gay propaganda", has been criticized by human rights advocates for its discriminatory intent.
counter-protesters in kiev, including members of the orthodox church, vehemently opposed the march, reflecting the widespread societal division on lgbtq+ rights issues.
the event transpired despite a court ruling banning such assemblies, with city officials citing concerns about potential violence and public complaints.
the perseverance of the activists in the face of opposition and the history-making nature of the occasion were emphasized by semenova, underscoring the ongoing struggle for equality and rights within ukraine's lgbtq+ community, as highlighted in a recent amnesty international report.

local media in switzerland reported the discovery of a highly radioactive substance that exceeded permitted radiation levels by 100 times in certain areas.
the hazardous material, identified as radium in an old dump in bienne, was kept secret by federal, regional, and local officials for 18 months to prevent alarming the 50,000 residents.
the revelation of 120kg of radioactive waste found during sorting raised concerns, with measurements reaching several hundred microsieverts at the source and up to 300 microsieverts per hour in some spots—well above the allowable limit for an old dump.
daniel dauwalder, a spokesperson for the swiss federal office for public health, confirmed these findings reported by le matin dimanche.
the radioactive waste originated from a paint used by the watch-making industry to illuminate watch faces, banned since 1963 due to its radioactivity.
the risk to public health was deemed "weak" by the ofsp, despite plans for water table testing outlined by sonntags zeitung.
the situation was criticized by francois bochud, president of the federal commission overseeing radiation monitoring, who was not initially informed of the incident.
bochud highlighted the authorities' error and warned about the repercussions on credibility and public trust in the future.
after a chemical fire sparked by an explosion at a cargo warehouse in brazil, emergency responders successfully extinguished the flames following a 48-hour operation.
the inferno in santos led to the release of toxic gases affecting the vicinity of the nation's largest port and spreading across four nearby cities.
according to the warehouse owners, the incident was triggered by a chemical reaction between acid and a disinfectant in the containers and rainwater.
nearly 200 individuals across three cities required hospitalization due to respiratory issues caused by the fumes.
authorities are currently conducting an investigation to ascertain liability for the fire, which was confronted by over 300 firefighters.
the affected container terminal, managed by the logistics firm localfrio in guaruja, part of the santos region in sao paulo state, primarily handles chemical exports for refrigeration and general cargo.
the company confirmed that the containers housed chloric acid and sodium dichloroisocyanurate, a cleansing and sanitizing substance.
reports from guaruja detailed damage to 85 containers on-site, prompting the local mayor, maria antonieta de brito, to caution residents against exposure to rain potentially carrying hazardous chemical residues.
a 51ft container, resembling those used for beer fermentation and suspected to have fallen from a ship, was discovered by a dog walker on poll na crann beach near griminish, also known as stinky bay in west benbecula.
stornoway coastguard noted its similarity to tanks utilized by american brewer coors, while the company expressed no knowledge of a missing container.
representatives from the german company ziemann, known for manufacturing similar tanks, were unreachable for a statement.
various individuals shared theories regarding the container's origin with the bbc news website, including speculations that the "5580" label on it could indicate it was linked to holding chemicals in the dtd 5580 paint scheme for aircraft.
another suggestion was that it might have been a rocket stage launched from south uist for firing meteorological rockets in the 1960s and 70s.
a recent discovery from a news release indicates that fish oil supplements may have a protective effect on the heart during stressful situations.
jason carter, a researcher at michigan technological university, led a study involving 67 healthy participants who were randomly assigned to consume either nine grams of fish oil pills or nine grams of olive oil pills as a placebo for a two-month period.
prior to and following the study, the participants underwent screenings for heart rate, blood pressure, and other relevant metrics.
after the designated period, the participants completed a mental arithmetic test involving basic calculations to evaluate their stress response.
the findings revealed that individuals who had been taking fish oil supplements for an extended period showed lower stress levels during the test compared to those on the placebo.
carter, the chair of kinesiology and integrative physiology at michigan tech, emphasized the significance of these results in understanding the cardiovascular benefits of fish oil during mental stress.
this study, which suggests that omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil can positively impact neural cardiovascular regulation, recommends incorporating natural omega-3-rich foods into diets for those not taking fish oil supplements.
the research has been published in the american journal of physiology: regulatory, integrative, and comparative physiology, solidifying the benefits of fish oil for heart health.

fleetwood secured a late victory against league one's bottom club coventry, thanks to cian bolger's dramatic winning goal in the final minutes of normal time.
bolger's powerful header from a corner lifted fleetwood to fourth place in the table.
throughout the match, coventry struggled to keep up with fleetwood's performance, as evidenced by ashley hunter's early chance and bobby grant's close effort.
despite a scare from andy rose's mishit cross, fleetwood remained dominant.
in the second half, callum reilly hit the post with a header, giving fleetwood a scare, but bolger's late heroics ensured the win and maintained their push for promotion.
fleetwood manager uwe rosler made strategic changes that proved vital in securing the crucial victory.
(report courtesy of the press association) home ownership in canada often provokes much contemplation.
the acquisition of a home, particularly a single-family dwelling, is commonly regarded as the ultimate achievement in the pursuit of happiness that many canadians subscribe to.
however, according to nathan lauster, single-family homes are not just overvalued but also detrimental to a city's well-being.
lauster argues that these dwellings often breed social isolation, prioritize private spaces over vibrant public areas, and impede opportunities for diverse social interactions.
in his book "the death and life of the single family house," the ubc sociology professor from vancouver describes single-family housing as a drain on urban vitality.
despite this, he sees vancouver as a potential pioneer in reimagining urban planning to move away from reliance on single-family homes.
a cbi team consisting of six members has recently visited burj jwahar singh wala and bargari villages to investigate the sacrilege incidents.
according to ssp faridkot sukhminder singh mann, the cbi team arrived yesterday and is expected to stay for an additional two days.
during their visit, the cbi investigators took statements from the granthis of burj jwahar singh wala gurdwara and gurdwara bargari.
the local police are actively assisting the cbi team by providing them with relevant documents and coordinating with their investigation efforts.
the punjab government had assigned the investigation of the sacrilege incidents in bargari village in faridkot to the cbi on november 1.
the cases registered at the bajakhana police station in faridkot district pertain to the theft of guru granth sahib in burj jawahar singh wala village in june, the distribution of inciting posters in bargari and burj jawahar singh wala villages in september, and the sacrilege of guru granth sahib with torn pages found at bargari in october.
a man from maine, identified as dwight nathan hart of bingham, was apprehended by the police for allegedly attempting to steal lawn chairs from a woman's yard.
when the woman confronted him with a garden hoe to prevent the theft, hart reportedly brandished a machete.
the incident, which occurred on a sunday evening in moscow, resulted in hart being charged with criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon and criminal trespassing.
according to reports from the morning sentinel, the 64-year-old hart drove his pickup truck onto the woman's property and began removing the lawn chairs.
despite the woman's warning with the hoe, hart escalated the situation by wielding a machete, causing minor damage to the hoe.
currently, hart is in custody with bail set, and it remains uncertain if he has legal representation.
tmz reported that an individual is attempting to profit from former six division world champion oscar de la hoya's personal struggles.
the unidentified person is seeking to sell photographs allegedly capturing de la hoya using cocaine at a party in las vegas.
this development closely follows de la hoya's recent announcement of his entry into rehab for substance abuse.
the pictures were reportedly taken at a gathering in a las vegas hotel room shortly before de la hoya publicly disclosed his rehab plans.
the seller shared these images with tmz, detailing how de la hoya was seen using a rolled-up bill to consume a white substance off a table.
the seller claimed the substance was cocaine.
tmz noted that de la hoya is aware of the existence of these photos.
additionally, in 2007, de la hoya faced a similar incident when pictures of him dressed in women's lingerie were leaked by a new york city stripper.
initially denying their authenticity, de la hoya later confirmed the veracity of the photos during a univision interview in 2011, where he admitted to being heavily intoxicated in the images.
israel announced on thursday that it had halted entry permits for 83,000 palestinians during ramadan, a holy month for muslims, in response to a shooting incident in tel aviv that resulted in the deaths of four individuals.
the coordinator of government activities in the territories (cogat), responsible for civilian affairs in the occupied west bank, released a statement declaring that all permits for ramadan, including those for family visits from judea and samaria to israel, were on hold.
the suspension would impact not only the 83,000 palestinians from the west bank but also several residents from gaza who had permits to visit relatives and holy sites during the festive period.
cogat's decision came after two palestinians carried out a shooting at a popular tel aviv venue near israel's military headquarters the previous night.
the incident resulted in the fatality of four individuals and was identified as one of the gravest attacks in a recent spate of violence.
additionally, cogat mentioned that permits for 204 relatives of one of the alleged assailants had been frozen.
israel had recently eased restrictions on the movement of palestinians, predominantly from the west bank, as well as those residing in gaza, for ramadan.
the plan included permitting up to 500 individuals from gaza to attend friday prayers at the israeli-controlled al-aqsa mosque compound in east jerusalem during the holy month, which had commenced on monday.
notably, since october, the continuous violence had claimed the lives of a minimum of 207 palestinians, 28 israelis, two americans, an eritrean, and a sudanese, with most of the casualties being attributed to knife, gun, or car-ramming attacks by palestinians, as per israeli authorities.
moreover, additional fatalities occurred in confrontations or due to israeli airstrikes in the gaza strip.
melbourne's ruck depth is facing a severe challenge following jake spencer's early exit from the demons' anzac day eve match against richmond at the mcg.
with max gawn already sidelined due to a hamstring injury, spencer sustained injuries to his ac joint in the shoulder and knee, prompting his absence from the game after the first half.
his situation was compounded by rookie forward tim smith, who was rushed to the hospital with suspected broken ribs.
this unfortunate turn of events left melbourne with only two available players on the interchange.
spencer, seen on the bench with his arm in a sling, is likely to face an extended period on the sidelines.
meanwhile, smith's health concerns grew after a collision with richmond's alex rance, raising worries about a possible collapsed lung.
germany has issued a strong warning concerning the continuation of development aid to countries unwilling to repatriate rejected asylum seekers.
the action was ignited by the failure to deport the prime suspect in the berlin christmas market attack back to tunisia.
vice chancellor sigmar gabriel emphasized the necessity for cooperation by stating that countries failing to do so risk losing german aid.
interior minister thomas de maiziere expressed his full endorsement on a public television show.
the primary focus of the cautionary message was on tunisia, the home nation of anis amri, the suspected attacker responsible for the berlin tragedy that claimed 12 lives.
despite germany's rejection of amri's asylum request in june, bureaucratic obstacles in tunisia delayed his return.
urgent travel documents were only issued posthumously, highlighting the inefficiencies in the repatriation process.
germany is now contemplating detaining high-risk failed asylum seekers, particularly those associated with extremist ideologies, before deportation.
justice minister heiko maas indicated a forthcoming proposal to expand detention for dangerous individuals awaiting expulsion, particularly those facing challenges in being repatriated by their home countries.
in tunisia, public outrage has mounted against tunisian militants who traveled abroad to engage in extremist activities.
the anti-euro campaign is gaining momentum in greece, as the challenging bailout implementation is anticipated to bring about significant economic hardship and delay any hopes for recovery well into 2016 in the most optimistic scenario.
the forthcoming elections add another layer of uncertainty to the already fragile economy, paving the way for substantial downturn in the latter part of the year.
nordea bank warns that this situation might fuel anti-bailout sentiments, potentially complicating the future government's ability to adhere to the bailout terms.
if greece fails to meet the newly imposed conditions, nordea bank believes the grexit scenario may resurface.
while other euro-area nations could offer further compromises on the bailout conditions, a growing support for the anti-bailout and anti-euro factions in greece might ultimately lead to a grexit, should the population reach a breaking point.
the badges offered within the program cater to various stem fields.
for instance, the engineering badge encourages participants to engage in design challenges, enabling them to think like an engineer.
additionally, the robotics badge empowers girls to create their own robots.
participants can also earn a mechanical engineering badge by constructing and testing roller coasters, while embracing an outdoor stem badge requires involvement in citizen science projects.
furthermore, the computer science badge allows girls to delve into problem-solving strategies used by programmers.
while girls demonstrate early interest in stem, they often veer away from pursuing these paths due to several factors such as limited encouragement and support.
to address this issue, netflix collaborated with the girl scouts to promote stem career options to young girls.
the recent addition of cybersecurity badges, scheduled to launch next fall, highlights the organization's commitment to exposing its members to a diverse range of fields, beyond the conventional choices for young women.
achieving the proper speed and depth for an adequate amount of time is crucial for water's surface to enable jumping.
the water strider excels in executing these requirements flawlessly, attributed to the slightly curved tips of its legs as observed by the team.
by mimicking the strider's morphology and movements, the group successfully engineered a robotic insect with a lightweight catapult mechanism, allowing it to exert force up to 16 times its body weight without breaking the water's surface, thus mimicking real strider-like jumps.
notably, a previous team had developed a larger robot based on the same insect years ago, contrasting this team's creation which closely mirrors the size of actual striders, as depicted in the video below.
these miniature robots hold potential for future applications such as search operations.
notably, the innovative manufacturing process of using folded composite structures that self-assemble makes mass production of these robots a feasible endeavor.
after a notable blunder with the chilean national anthem at the university of phoenix stadium in glendale, where organizers mistakenly played chile’s anthem instead of uruguay’s before their match against mexico, the embarrassment continued for the copa america centenario organizers.
during chile's game against argentina, held at levi's stadium in santa clara, california, a further mistake occurred when pitbull's single "mr.
worldwide" disrupted the conclusion of chile’s anthem.
despite the interruptions, the chilean team and their supporters admirably continued singing their anthem with pride, displaying resilience amidst the mishaps.
baltimore ravens quarterback joe flacco currently boasts 10 playoff wins, surpassing the total playoff wins of 10 nfl teams.
these teams, with less than 10 playoff wins in their franchise history, include all but the carolina panthers, jacksonville jaguars, and houston texans.
remarkably, eight of these teams have been established in the league for over 40 years, making flacco's accomplishment all the more noteworthy.
despite the ravens' recent disappointing 5-11 season, this intriguing statistic sheds light on the historical success gap among nfl teams.
notably, the panthers, jaguars, and texans have valid reasons for their lower playoff win counts, having been relatively new additions to the league in the mid-1990s and early 2000s, respectively.
the contrast is most striking for the longstanding teams in the league, making this statistic a curious and somewhat amusing fact amid the ravens' recent performance.
some educational institutions are taking extreme measures to prevent cheating during exams, such as banning all watches to deter the use of smartwatches as cheating tools.
one university, london's city university, justifies this decision by stating that verifying each watch as analog would not be feasible, prompting them to require students to have bare arms during tests.
while this policy may inconvenience students accustomed to checking their watch for time updates, it aligns with concerns about the potential for cheating facilitated by smartwatches.
whether or not smartwatch cheating is a prevalent issue, students are advised to refrain from wearing smartwatches like pebble or zenwatch during exams to avoid any risks.

coles has recently unveiled a bold challenge to woolworths' dan murphy's by introducing an innovative liquor store concept designed to streamline the process of purchasing affordable alcohol products while also outperforming competitor prices.
the inaugural trial establishment under the proactive liquormarket banner was inaugurated in ringwood, melbourne, marking a significant departure from its predecessor, a former first choice store that underwent a comprehensive refurbishment.
the novel retail format, drawing inspiration from retail giants like kmart or bunnings rather than coles' more upscale vintage cellars or woolworths' dan murphy's, emerged as a result of in-depth market research focused on identifying customer preferences in liquor retail.
coles is currently evaluating market reception to its new liquor market brand in ringwood, where an array of beer and spirits are meticulously curated and categorised by variety, style, or innovative "flavour maps" rather than traditional branding, promoting customer exploration of new offerings.
the selection undergoes rigorous assessment and ranking by coles' proficient liquor team, with product attributes exhibited on informative shelf labels to facilitate customer decision-making.
during childhood, kids are the most open to exploring and experimenting with gender norms and roles, which can shape their attitudes and behaviors for life.
while some may naturally gravitate towards playing with peers of the same gender most of the time, allowing them opportunities to interact with peers of the opposite gender introduces them to diverse perspectives and behaviors.
studies show that children who have friends of the opposite sex in early childhood tend to develop healthier romantic relationships later in life.
encouraging girls and boys to play together can help break down gender stereotypes.
for instance, if girls are only exposed to pink toys and products that reinforce traditional femininity, they may struggle to break free from those constraints.

on november 28, 2011, idaho state representative phil hart expressed concerns regarding the federal government's release of canadian gray wolves into idaho, citing potential public safety risks.
initially, an agreement between the federal government and idaho permitted the introduction of 100 wolves into the state; however, the current estimated population ranges from 1000 to 2000 wolves, weighing between 140 to 180 pounds each.
this discrepancy highlights mismanagement of the wolf program under the endangered species act, leading to increased risks to humans and livestock due to diseases and tapeworms carried by the wolves.
of particular concern is the potential fatality risk to humans from tapeworms found in wolf feces, which can remain dormant for up to 20 years.
in response, phil hart collaborated with dane vonbriechenruardt from the us bill of rights foundation, alongside legislators like judy boyle, to devise a legislative strategy aimed at safeguarding idaho residents.
this involved drafting legislation to declare a state of emergency, shifting power from federal agencies to the state and highlighting its utility as a blueprint for addressing other threatening issues.
however, just before the state of emergency bill was set to be enacted, congress removed the canadian gray wolves from the endangered species list, thereby transferring control to the state.
this maneuver seemingly avoided a potential conflict over the 10th amendment, as federal court jurisdiction is confined to federal statutes, establishing that the federal government would lack authority in case of a declared state of emergency under state police power.
according to the wall street journal on monday, apple is intensifying its focus on developing an electric car and has aimed for a 2019 shipment deadline.
the company has internally named the project "titan" and is reported to be fully dedicated to its success.
discussions have taken place with california officials to evaluate the feasibility of launching an apple car.
sources also mentioned that apple has authorized the team leading the 600-person project to expand their workforce significantly.
while apple's move into the automotive industry has been a topic of speculation, the 2019 target date remains tentative pending further development and addressing regulatory and production challenges, as per the report.
in a captivating turn of events, zambia orchestrated a remarkable comeback, overcoming a two-goal deficit to clinch a pulsating 4-2 triumph against iran on wednesday during the 2017 fifa under-20 world cup in gabon.
initially trailing after reza shekari netted twice to put iran 2-0 ahead early in the second half, zambia intensified their performance and swiftly scored four goals in a span of 17 minutes, stunning their opponents.
the goals were secured by fashion sakala, enock mwepu, emmanuel banda, and patson daka, propelling young chipolopolo to a second consecutive victory in the group stage, following their previous 2-0 win against portugal.
with this impressive display, zambia is well-positioned to progress to the knockout phase as one of the top two teams in their pool, alongside the four best third-place finishers.
despite iran's initial victory of 1-0 against costa rica, their fate hangs in the balance as they prepare to face portugal in their final group match on saturday.
zambia, on the other hand, asserts confidence in triumphing over costa rica in their upcoming fixture.
the match took a dramatic turn when shekari squandered an open opportunity before capitalizing on a defensive error from zambia's keeper, mangani manda.
however, zambia dramatically shifted the momentum in their favor as sakala, mwepu, banda, and daka showcased their prowess in front of goal, completing an astonishing turnaround to secure a memorable victory.

on sunday, syrian protestors cheered the progress achieved by libyan rebels, encouraged by the strides made by opposition forces in tripoli.
while they aspire for a similar outcome in damascus against president bashar assad's regime, syrian activists acknowledge the need for distinct tactics in their own rebellion, different from those used in libya.
"the successes of the libyan rebels fuel our determination to oust bashar," expressed one activist and member of the anti-regime local coordination committee in latakia, known as abu yousef.
the arab nations, long separated, are now united in a widespread popular uprising that has swept across the region.
in the eyes of syrian protestors, the destiny of their movement is closely tied to the unfolding events in a distant land.
"i have never been as engaged in libyan politics as i am now.
our struggle is a collective one.
we stand together in opposing autocrats and are united by the broader arab awakening," conveyed lina, a 26-year-old resident of damascus.
in hama, a site marked by some of the bloodiest episodes of the syrian uprising, residents and activists view the triumph of libya's rebels as a victory for the entire arab spring movement.
aston villa is considering sean dyche as they intensify their quest for a new manager.
while nigel pearson and david moyes are on their radar to succeed remi garde, who is set to depart pending agreement on his exit terms, dyche is also under consideration.
villa is specifically seeking a candidate with english football experience, preferably with a championship background.
though pearson and moyes are available, dyche's successful tenure at burnley, where he has propelled his team to the top of the table aiming for immediate promotion to the premier league, makes him an appealing contender.
the prospect of joining a renowned club like villa, especially amidst the ongoing restructuring, may entice the 44-year-old dyche.
today, the focus of the ongoing brexit negotiations between the uk and the representatives of the european union is primarily on ireland.
discussions are scheduled to extend until thursday, culminating in a joint press conference to be conducted by eu chief negotiator michel barnier and british brexit secretary david davis.
ireland has engaged in extensive discussions with the eu regarding the potential implications of brexit on the good friday agreement and the common travel area between ireland and britain.
however, the uk has yet to provide a comprehensive assessment to the eu on these matters.
today, british civil servants will be briefing an eu delegation on the uk's perspectives in a closed-door meeting.
one of the critical points of contention is whether the uk's evaluation of the challenges differs from the positions articulated by the irish government.
meanwhile, british prime minister theresa may has cautioned members of her conservative party to cease internal conflicts to avoid empowering labour leader jeremy corbyn, as reported by sky news.
recent public disputes among tory politicians over brexit and government spending have prompted concerns about potential leadership challenges.
may is anticipated to emphasize in a forthcoming meeting that cabinet discussions should remain confidential, and public discord within the party needs to be resolved promptly.

the golimog, a unique genus of small troglobite rodents, are indigenous to the upper underground rivers and pools of the cave systems located just beneath the surface of the wumbian basin.
evolved from sighted ancestors adapted to open-water environments, these atypical foons, about the size of squirrels, are distinguished by their retained forelimbs - characterized by a single elongated finger on each side of their chest.
this distinct feature, which has largely atrophied in their contemporary counterparts, enables them to navigate the rocky riverbeds in their lightless habitat.
the creatures' nasal structure has also undergone significant evolution to aid in perception in the absence of light.
their noses possess sensitive finger-like extensions that aid in detecting prey, typically small invertebrates.
descended into the caverns from their ancestral open rivers, golimog have completely lost their vision, with their eyes now obscured by skin, relying solely on their sense of touch and smell for navigation.
similar to their free-swimming relatives that inhabit the rivers of wumbian and the southern oceans, golimog are exclusively aquatic creatures, raising their well-developed offspring directly in the water and never venturing onto land.

in north lebanon, a recent two-day bout of violent confrontations has resulted in the deaths of no less than 10 individuals, as reported.
the clashes, primarily between supporters and opponents of syrian president bashar al-assad, took place in the port city of tripoli, leaving 49 individuals wounded, among them 11 soldiers, according to a security source.
tripoli holds a volatile sectarian divide, with a predominantly sunni population surrounding a small alawite community.
president assad, an alawite, is currently engaged in combat against a sunni-led uprising.
triggered by the display of syrian flags in support of president assad in the alawite district of jabal muhsin and the raising of rebel-favored flags in the neighboring bab al-tabbana, violent altercations erupted on saturday, leading to at least six fatalities.
the tension escalated further on sunday, with sniper shots injuring at least four individuals, including an off-duty soldier and two individuals in a lorry.
as a response, the lebanese army maintained a presence in the area, resulting in the detainment of four individuals by military personnel.
the clashes persisted into sunday night, prompting the closure of numerous schools in tripoli on monday, confirmed by the government news agency.
additionally, reports were refuted by the shia islamist militant group hezbollah, denying their alleged involvement in sending fighters and military specialists to jabal muhsin.
this recent outburst of violence adds to the recurring clashes between the two districts that have claimed numerous lives over the past couple of years.
written in 2009, this study delves into how public rhetoric serves as a significant tool for the president to steer american legal policy.
various research has explored the president's utilization of the "bully pulpit" to shape policy by influencing congress or public opinion, or by effecting changes within public agencies.
the argument posited here is that through rhetoric, the president can induce shifts in the behavior of public agencies, ultimately leading to substantial social ramifications.
the study specifically focuses on the unequal impact of presidential rhetoric on distinct "target populations" within the backdrop of the war on drugs.
in a meticulous examination, it is noted that the presidential rhetoric wielded a more pronounced effect on state arrest rates for african americans compared to whites, even after accounting for other potential factors.
these outcomes underscore how presidential rhetoric is interpreted through societal perceptions of public policy quandaries when translated into action by public officials.
the depiction of young australians as disinterested, indolent, and uninterested in political conversation is deemed misleading, baseless and hazardous by the researchers of a recent australian democracy study.
conducted by the university of canberra's institute for governance and policy analysis in collaboration with the museum of australian democracy, the study explored the diverse perspectives on our political system across different age groups and their proposed reforms.
during the power of 1 exhibition at the museum of australian democracy at old parliament house, max halupka and museum director daryl karp revealed insights.
max halupka, a research fellow at the institute for governance and policy analysis, highlighted that the survey showed a "shift in the landscape" as young individuals expressed disillusionment with politicians while still upholding democratic principles.
he noted that traditional measures like political party membership may not fully represent democratic engagement, emphasizing the importance of a more comprehensive evaluation of how individuals participate in the political process.

two members of the anti-kremlin punk band pussy riot have been transferred to remote prison camps to begin serving their sentences, the group announced.
maria alyokhina, 24, is set to complete her two-year term at a women's prison camp in perm, located in a harsh siberian region known for hosting some of the soviet union's toughest camps.
nadezhda tolokonnikova, 22, has been sent to mordovia, another region notorious for its high concentration of prisons.
the band conveyed via its twitter account on monday that these camps were among the most severe options available.
alyokhina and tolokonnikova were found guilty of hooliganism incited by religious animosity after staging an anti-putin performance in a moscow cathedral in february.
they contended that their conviction was emblematic of a broader clampdown on freedom of speech and political activism in russia.
the two women are anticipated to serve out their sentences, ending in march 2014, in these reportedly grim prison conditions.
the third member, yekaterina samutsevich, was recently released under a suspended sentence.
supporters of pussy riot have suggested that her release was a calculated move by authorities to project leniency.
on monday, confusion prevailed as family members and legal representatives sought to ascertain the precise locations of the two women.
both perm and mordovia have multiple prison camps, some of which were part of the soviet-era gulag system.
prison officials have declined to disclose the whereabouts of alyokhina and tolokonnikova.
the incarcerated pair had sought to serve their sentences in moscow, citing a desire to remain close to their young children; alyokhina has a five-year-old son named filipp, and tolokonnikova has a four-year-old daughter named gera.
a significant ruling by the high court is poised to determine the future course of action for the independent commission against corruption (icac) and the validity of its findings against high-profile figures targeted in its investigations.
the court will announce its decision on wednesday following the legal dispute between the icac and crown prosecutor margaret cunneen, sc, regarding a potential inquiry into allegations of obstructing justice.
the icac has approached the high court to secure the authority to investigate margaret cunneen.
notable inquiries that could be impacted by this ruling include the ongoing investigation into australian water holdings, linked to obeid, and the examination of a coal tenement situated on the obeid family's property.
at the core of the high court case lies the interpretation of "corrupt conduct" according to the icac act, which offers various definitions of corruption with particular focus on the behavior of private individuals.
reports have surfaced indicating that a significant number of penguins have been found deceased along the shores of brazil, with estimates reaching around 500 casualties in sao paulo state alone.
investigation by scientists is ongoing to determine the cause of this mass mortality event.
preliminary autopsies on some of the penguin carcasses reveal signs of possible starvation, evident from their empty stomachs.
researchers are exploring the hypothesis that factors like intense currents and colder temperatures might have contributed to this phenomenon.
thiago do nascimento from the peruibe aquarium mentioned the atypical drop in sea temperatures disrupting the food chain of the penguins, potentially driving away their prey such as fish and squid.
additionally, concerns have been raised about overfishing severely impacting the availability of food for these marine birds.
nascimento highlighted the startling contrast in numbers, with previous years seeing only a handful of deceased penguins washing ashore, as opposed to the current distressing figure.
the unexplained surge in penguin mortalities within a short timeframe has raised alarms among experts monitoring the situation.
digital restrictions management, often referred to as drm, involves the implementation of technological constraints that govern users' actions with digital content.
whether it's inhibiting the copying or sharing of a song, accessing an ebook on a different device, or playing a single-player game offline, drm effectively limits these capabilities.
essentially, drm acts as a barrier, hindering what users would normally be able to do unhindered.
as a result, drm consolidates authority over the creation and distribution of media, granting drm proponents the ability to censor content and surveil individuals' media consumption habits on a large scale.
if we aim to prevent a future where our devices are used to monitor and regulate our digital interactions, it is essential to advocate for maintaining control over our software and media.

communication between a game and an audio engine typically operates unidirectionally, as the game transmits data to the audio engine for the playback of sound.
however, this one-way interaction can be likened to a dancer performing without being able to hear and respond to the music.
sound, being a temporal medium, plays a crucial role in conveying temporal aspects such as pace, suspense, and resolution.
to ensure a cohesive temporal experience and smooth transitions between different temporal emotions, the game must learn to actively engage with and adapt to the playing sound.
through the analysis of playdead's game, inside, various methods will be explored to illustrate how implementing feedback loops between the game and audio can enhance the overall temporal flow of the gameplay.
these approaches include integrating audio-driven gameplay, instances where sound prompts in-game actions, and seamlessly incorporating death-respawn scenarios within the game's auditory framework.
albania, holding the 70th rank globally, created a significant upset by defeating portugal in their euro 2016 group i qualifying match in aveiro.
bekim balaj's volley was the deciding factor in sinking the 2012 semi-finalists.

the senate intelligence committee has issued a subpoena requesting documents from michael flynn, former national security adviser to donald trump, in connection to alleged russian interference in the us election.
the subpoena was issued as part of the committee's investigation into possible links between russia and the trump campaign.
despite initial requests for the documents made on april 28, flynn's lawyer did not provide them, prompting the committee's chairman, richard burr, and vice chairman, mark warner, to take further action.
senator warner stated that while some documents have been submitted by certain individuals, others are not cooperating, necessitating the committee to consider its "next steps".
flynn was dismissed by president trump in february for reportedly misleading top officials, including vice president mike pence, regarding his communications with russia's ambassador in washington.
additionally, former acting us attorney general sally yates testified that she had cautioned the white house about flynn's susceptibility to russian blackmail.
investigations on flynn's interactions and financial dealings with entities associated with the russian and turkish governments are being conducted by various congressional committees and the pentagon's inspector general.
both russia and the trump administration have denied any collusion to influence the outcome of the election.
botswana president ian khama received stitches on his face following a scratch by a cheetah while observing the animal being fed in its enclosure at an army barracks.
government officials clarified that the incident was considered a "freak accident" rather than an intentional attack.
despite the swift and surprising nature of the event, mr.
khama sustained only minor injuries, with no significant security concerns arising.
a government spokesperson emphasized that the encounter was more of a scratch than a deliberate attack.
khama was later seen wearing a plaster during a subsequent meeting.
cheetahs, known as the fastest land animals and listed as endangered species, are estimated to have a remaining population of around 12,400 in the wild across african countries, including botswana.
uber is now offering a new feature named "smart routes" for uberpool, designed to help customers save money.
instead of picking up passengers directly from their homes, cars will now operate along specific corridors.
customers opting for this feature will need to walk to designated pick-up points resembling bus stops along the designated route highlighted by a green line on the map.
in return for this adjustment, uber promises customers a discount of at least one dollar.
this feature is akin to a previous testing phase known as "suggested pickup points," where cars would still pick up customers near their residences.
today, firefox 51 was released, and chrome 56, which was originally slated for release next week, has also been rolled out.
both browsers have begun classifying certain http connections as insecure as part of the ongoing industry-wide effort to promote the adoption of encrypted https.
the updates are gradually deployed, so users should expect to see them within the next few days.
websites delivered over http that contain forms, specifically those with password and credit card fields, will now display warnings in the address bar to alert users to the lack of security.
this labeling is aimed at discouraging the common practice of placing password fields on http pages with forms submitted to https locations, which provides minimal security as http pages are easily tampered with by eavesdroppers.
the introduction of non-secure labeling is intended to prompt developers to transition from using http to https, especially when handling sensitive data.
google has opted for a more direct approach by displaying "not secure" in the address bar, while firefox uses a padlock icon with a red strike-through.
both browsers have plans in place to further emphasize the use of https; firefox will feature warnings near the password box on http pages in a future release, while google aims to show the "not secure" message in the address bar for all http pages eventually, regardless of content.
the orion nebula is depicted in this image captured from eso's paranal observatory in the atacama desert on earth, with four laser beams slicing through it.
rather than being involved in an interstellar conflict, these lasers are actually aiding in the observation of orion through ut4, one of the observatory's large telescopes, as part of a technical trial for an adaptive optics system to enhance image clarity.
the perspective outside the ut4 enclosure allowed for the visualization of the laser beams, which are scattered by the earth's dense lower atmosphere in the first few kilometers above the observatory.
notably, the four distinct segments seen beyond the beams are emissions from a sodium atom layer at higher altitudes of 80-90 kilometers, triggered by the laser light.
from the viewpoint of ut4, these segments manifest as bright spots or artificial guide stars, their variations utilized in real-time to rectify atmospheric distortion along the line-of-sight by managing a deformable mirror within the telescope's optical pathway.
salomon kalou, the former chelsea forward, demonstrated his prowess by scoring two goals for lille in a turnaround victory against bastia, enabling them to stay competitive with the leaders of ligue 1.
despite midfielder ludovic genest opening the scoring for bastia in the third minute, kalou showcased his skill by quickly leveling the score with a well-placed shot before elegantly curling an exceptional finish from outside the box.
following this impressive performance, lille now trails league leaders paris st-germain by four points.
with their solid defense having only conceded six goals so far, they continue to maintain a strong position in third place, while bastia, a former club of chelsea midfielder michael essien, remain in 13th place.
as per a report published in a prominent newspaper, the family of the late mohammad akhlaq has lodged a complaint with the police alleging involvement of a local bjp leader's son in instigating the violent mob.
additional district magistrate rajesh yadav has been cited in the report stating that vishal, the son of the local bjp leader sanjay rana, is among the five accused.
the allegation that beef was kept in akhlaq's residence was initiated by the temple priest, as per information shared by the family members.
they claim that vishal influenced the priest to make the announcement, and the priest has confessed to being coerced.
nevertheless, the police have noted inconsistencies in the accounts provided by the priest regarding the unfolding events.
sanjay rana, the bjp leader, has denied all accusations, affirming a close bond with akhlaq and informing the police regarding the tragic lynching.
he asserts his prolonged allegiance of over two decades to the party, although it is indicated that he currently does not hold any official party position.
meanwhile, union cultural minister mahesh sharma created controversy by reiterating his view that akhlaq's lynching was unintended, and cautioned against attributing any communal motives to the incident.
the minister visited bisara village in dadri, meeting akhlaq's family and addressing a congregation of approximately 200 individuals at a temple.
this gathering took place at the same temple where an appeal was made on monday night, resulting in a crowd assembling at akhlaq's residence.
tragically, akhlaq was subsequently attacked by a mob who accused him of consuming and storing beef.
thirteen minutes of gameplay from a developmental version of obsidian entertainment's cancelled squad-based rpg aliens: crucible have emerged, offering a glimpse into what could have been for aliens fans still recovering from the disappointment of colonial marines.
despite being clearly unfinished, the leaked footage showcases various elements like character creation, skill trees, squad control, dialogue options with consequences, quick time events, a range of weapons, hacking mechanisms, encounters with the queen, and intense alien battles.
the video, assembled from different segments possibly from various builds, includes a notable build dated december 22, 2008, close to the project's cancellation.
although an earlier snippet surfaced in 2010, this recent leak provides the most substantial and up-to-date insight into the game that was announced alongside colonial marines in 2006.
despite being axed without an official explanation by sega in june 2009, former obsidian employees and their ceo, feargus urquhart, expressed disappointment over the cancellation, suggesting that crucible appeared ready for release.
even though the leaked footage hints at a potentially finished product, its overall quality remains questionable, but that didn't deter sega from ultimately releasing colonial marines.
in a recent development, nhl commissioner gary bettman instructed brendan shanahan to step down from his role overseeing the league's department of player safety upon assuming the position of president of the toronto maple leafs.

the league assures that the established approach by the department of player safety will be maintained, and it is committed to upholding a consistent standard of enforcement and disciplinary measures throughout the remainder of the season.
retired ufc legend chael sonnen has expressed interest in acquiring world wrestling entertainment (wwe) from the mcmahon family.
reports reveal that sonnen and his team have been in discussions with industry executives and investors regarding the potential purchase of the renowned wrestling company.
despite wwe's stance on maintaining ownership, representatives have recommended sonnen to consider investing in wwe stock.
although the notion appears far-fetched, sonnen's ties to wwe superstar cm punk and his reputation as a top-notch provocateur in combat sports lend credibility to the idea.
following his recent defeat to light heavyweight champion jon jones at ufc 159, speculations arose about sonnen's retirement; however, the fighter clarified in an ufc tonight interview that he has no immediate plans to step away from the sport, especially before facing wanderlei silva.
today at 0905 ut marks the arrival of september's equinox.
this event occurs as the sun moves across the celestial equator towards the south, signaling the beginning of spring in the southern hemisphere and autumn in the northern hemisphere.
despite the mysterious link between the seasons, both spring and autumn experience an uptick in geomagnetic storms.
with longer nights in the north, the equinox also signals the start of prime aurora viewing season.
captured earlier this month, the captivating green auroral display lights up the night sky above hidden lake territorial park near yellowknife, northwest territories, canada.
the peaceful water reflects the vibrant aurora, while dazzling star trails twinkle amidst the enchanting celestial backdrop.
notably, these auroras, shining at altitudes of around 100 kilometers, are even visible from space.
a devastating explosion at mexico's famous fireworks market on the outskirts of the capital claimed the lives of at least 29 individuals and left 70 others injured, as confirmed by local police on tuesday.
the incident occurred in tultepec, a suburb, and the resulting blaze sent a massive cloud of grey smoke soaring into the air.
tragically, reports from local news outlets indicated that children were among those affected.
among the casualties, mexico state's governor, eruviel avila, stated that 26 bodies were found at the scene, and an additional three succumbed to their injuries in the hospital, bringing the total fatalities to 29.
although federal police initially reported nine deaths, they later updated the figure on twitter to 70 injuries, with all injured parties swiftly taken to nearby emergency departments.
isidro sanchez, the director of tultepec emergency services, underscored that the death toll was provisional while rescue teams meticulously searched the area.
firefighters fought fiercely for three hours to quell the flames and finally managed to bring the situation under control.
dear speaker pelosi, your steadfast leadership guiding the democratic party during this demanding primary season is deeply valued.
we want to express our gratitude for your unyielding advocacy for the people's right to select the nominee, emphasizing that superdelegates should honor the voters' choices.
on this day, march 26, 2008, a group of top donors and supporters of senator hillary clinton has criticized you for championing democracy and implied the possibility of withdrawing their backing from the dccc if their demands are not met.
the individuals behind this letter seem to suggest that their influence, stemming from their wealth and power, can manipulate the nomination process.
however, the surge of voters and caucus attendees from diverse backgrounds has rejected this sort of top-down politics that has long plagued our political landscape.
in contrast, senator barack obama's campaign, rooted in grassroots efforts, presents an alternative to the dominance of a select few in determining the election's outcome.
the overwhelming support pouring into senator obama's campaign has broken donation records for a primary election, showcasing a commitment that extends beyond financial contributions to active participation through volunteering, campaigning, and rallying for the cause.
the activism sparked by senator obama's campaign has resonated with millions of voters across party lines, illustrating a shift away from wealth-driven politics.
it is evident that honoring the will of the people, who have actively engaged in exercising their voting rights, is vital.
we urge you, speaker pelosi, to continue encouraging superdelegates to back the candidate who has garnered the most pledged delegates and leads in the popular vote.
upholding the democratic principle of respecting the choice of the electorate is crucial for the integrity of our party and the future of our nation.
as the ship's recovery progresses, captain schettino is reportedly residing at home with his wife in the coastal town of meta di sorrento, close to naples.
his trial, where he is facing charges of manslaughter and abandoning ship, commenced in july in grosseto, tuscany, the nearest city to the location of the tragic event.
schettino contends that the reef his ship struck on the night of january 13, 2012, was not indicated on his navigational charts, despite it being visible on tourist maps of giglio.
during the hearing, his attorney refuted the accusation that the captain willfully deserted the ship, asserting that schettino was accidentally thrown off the vessel.
schettino has claimed that he mistakenly fell into a lifeboat, which was then lowered and took him to shore.
pepe, outside court, emphasized, "the allegation of him abandoning the ship is a misrepresentation.
we seek the truth to prevail in this trial." schettino maintains that he has been unfairly targeted by costa cruises, the italian company owning the ship, alleging that the management pushed him to navigate close to giglio to entertain passengers.
legal proceedings are currently on hold during the summer, with the trial slated to resume on september 23.
the trial is expected to gather up to 700 witnesses and plaintiffs, suggesting it could extend over several years.
cheonghaejin marine has sparked concern by indicating that it will not be taking care of funeral expenses for the part-time employees of the sunken ferry sewol.
as reported by ko dong-hwan in kookmin ilbo on wednesday, the owner of the sunken ferry sewol has made it clear that they will not be covering funeral costs for the part-time employees of the vessel.
this decision was prompted by the tragic deaths of lee, 19, and bang, 20, who were employed on the sewol, responsible for meals for the passengers.
sadly, their bodies were recovered on tuesday from the fifth-floor lobby of the sunken ferry.
according to the report, cheonghaejin marine informed the city of incheon that they will only be providing financial assistance for the funeral arrangements of their full-time employees and not the part-time workers.
it has been disclosed that there were a total of four part-time employees on board the sewol, two of whom survived the horrific incident.
the report further reveals that all four employees were close friends since their elementary school days.
envision a scenario where governmental surveillance tracks your movements at every turn.
whether you board a train in the morning, hop on a bus to reach your workplace, or take a ferry for a client meeting, your journeys on all public transportation modes are meticulously logged in a burgeoning database, creating a comprehensive profile of your whereabouts.
while this may seem like a sensationalized plot from a hollywood blockbuster or reminiscent of an nsa-style surveillance program limited to america, the reality is much closer to home.
with the impending introduction of the opal card payment system by the nsw government to replace conventional paper tickets on sydney's public transport network, this level of tracking could soon become routine for commuters.
trials are already underway on ferries and a train line, with plans for a gradual rollout on a broader scale throughout the nsw transport network by the following year.
the government's primary goal is to streamline the travel experience for customers, eliminating the need for paper tickets and offering a convenient payment method.
by simply loading funds onto the opal card and swiping at entry and exit points, or when boarding a bus, passengers can enjoy a hassle-free journey.
the system also allows for automatic top-ups by linking the opal card to a credit card.
while current discussions mainly focus on the system's advantages, associated costs, and potential fare adjustments, one aspect that has received less attention is the extensive people-tracking capabilities that opal could present, possibly making it the most extensive surveillance system implemented in australia.
sky sports sources have revealed that swansea is currently in discussions with celtic regarding the potential signing of ki sung-yueng.
there has been speculation surrounding ki's future at celtic during the summer transfer window, with several clubs expressing interest in the midfielder.
since his arrival at celtic from fc seoul in 2010, the 23-year-old has made a significant impact at parkhead, contributing to their spl title win last season and gaining attention for his performances at the olympics with south korea.
although clubs like arsenal and queens park rangers have been linked with ki, swansea seems to be leading the race to secure the south korean's services.
swansea manager michael laudrup is keen on strengthening his midfield following joe allen's departure to liverpool.
it is believed that celtic is open to selling ki for the right price, and negotiations between the two clubs are reportedly progressing well.
during the sixth day of my weeklong journey across america by air, i found myself squeezed into a middle seat on a flight from des moines to phoenix, clad in the same sweatpants i had slept in.
frustrated with the in-flight entertainment and feeling hunger pangs, i resorted to my carry-on meal: a container of yogurt.
unfortunately, the pressure inside the yogurt had built up during the flight while it was stashed in the seat pocket.
as i tried to open it, the yogurt exploded, splattering blobs all over me, the seat, the floor, and even a nearby passenger, who was none too pleased about having vanilla yogurt in his hair.
lunch was cancelled for me that day.
it was far from a successful flight experience, but seasoned travelers understand that unpleasant incidents in the air are a common occurrence and not exclusive to one passenger.
the challenges of air travel seem to be escalating, with each new dilemma captured and shared via cellphones.
from a man being forcibly removed from an oversold united flight in chicago, an american airlines flight attendant threatening a crying mother with a stroller, to a delta passenger facing child confiscation threats over a paid seat, the unfriendliness in the skies appears to be escalating into more surreal and distressing scenarios.
in 1915, a doomed journey referred to as the ross sea party headed towards the new zealand side of antarctica with the purpose of establishing supply depots for explorers.
when their ship drifted away from the moorings, the group of six men found themselves marooned, facing a fierce battle for survival during their three-year ordeal on the icy continent before finally being rescued.
fast forward almost a century later, a recent revelation implies that the men may have left behind more than previously thought.
during the restoration of one of the supply huts used by the party, antarctic conservators stumbled upon a collection of 22 undeveloped cellulose nitrate negatives, believed to have been left there by the ross sea party.
these images offer fresh perspectives of ross island, mcmurdo sound, and two previously unseen photographs of the expedition's lead scientist, alexander stevens, further solidifying their connection to the expedition.
remarkably, despite the extensive time spent in the harsh icy conditions, most of the photo damage was localized to the edges.
through meticulous efforts, the conservators managed to achieve a nearly flawless restoration of the photographs.
the fully restored images are now accessible for viewing on the antarctic heritage trust website.
eibar ended their debut season in the primera division with a bitter disappointment as despite a convincing 3-0 victory over cordoba, they were ultimately relegated.
goals from mikel arruabarrena, raul navas, and ander capa in the first half seemed to promise a glimmer of hope, but their fate was sealed when diogo salomao's late equalizer in the match between deportivo la coruna and barcelona resulted in a 2-2 draw.
deportivo's better head-to-head record over eibar ensured their stay in the top flight along with granada, who secured their position with a goalless draw against atletico madrid.
eibar, who had struggled with just one win in the latter part of the season, displayed an early dominance with arruabarrena's header and navas' goal from a corner within a short span.
capa further extended the lead with a well-struck shot from the edge of the box.
despite cordoba's attempts to claw back into the game towards the end of the first half, eibar's defense held firm.
however, they were unable to replicate their first-half performance in the second half.
the news of the equalizer in the concurrent match soon dampened the celebratory atmosphere at ipurua stadium, signaling eibar's unfortunate relegation back to the segunda division a.
shahbaz taseer, the son of the late punjab governor salman taseer, who was tragically assassinated for opposing the blasphemy law earlier this year, has reportedly been abducted according to pakistani authorities.
the incident took place in lahore's affluent gulberg area, where shahbaz taseer's vehicle was intercepted by four unidentified men.
although the identity of the abductors remains unknown, taseer's family disclosed that they had been receiving threats from extremist factions.
the governor was assassinated by his own bodyguard, mumtaz qadri, just as he was preparing to enter his car.
the police have initiated a search operation for shahbaz taseer, with an eyewitness stating that he was forcibly taken at gunpoint by the perpetrators.
speculation surrounds the potential involvement of taliban and other extremist groups in the abduction, as the taseer family had been under threat due to their stance on the blasphemy law reforms advocated by the late salman taseer, an influential political figure in pakistan.
in the town of morlaix, brittany, french vegetable farmers protested against declining living standards by setting fire to tax and insurance offices.
using tractors and trailers, they dumped artichokes, cauliflowers, and manure in the streets, and also smashed windows, according to police reports.
prime minister manuel valls criticized the protesters for hindering firefighters from extinguishing the fires.
the farmers expressed their struggle to cope with plummeting prices due to a russian embargo on certain western goods, affecting their export markets.
around 100 farmers initiated the protest by targeting an insurance office outside morlaix, which they destroyed by setting it ablaze.
subsequently, they moved to the main tax office in the town, where they dumped unsold produce, smashed windows, and set fire to the building.
the farmers also blocked a major road in morlaix in both directions.
pm valls strongly denounced the violence and emphasized that those responsible would face legal consequences.
he urged the farmers to engage in discussions with national and local authorities, as farming and the food industry are vital sources of employment in brittany.
the protests stemmed from discontent with the government's tax policies and their impact on farmers' livelihoods.

nasa scientists have issued a warning about a significant crack in the antarctic ice sheet that is rapidly widening and may result in the formation of a massive iceberg in the coming months.
the crack, located in western antarctica's pine island glacier, spans at least 30 kilometers in length and 50 meters in depth.
according to nasa's findings, the rift is expanding at a pace of two meters per day.
nasa project scientist michael studinger confirmed the rate of widening and predicts that the ice will eventually break, resulting in an iceberg exceeding 880 square kilometers.
despite concerns, studinger clarified that the process is a natural occurrence and not directly linked to global warming.
he anticipates the formation of the large iceberg later this year or early next year as part of the glacier's regular cycle.
the atlanta falcons are currently in the process of searching for a new head coach following mike smith's departure.
general manager thomas dimitroff's position is also under scrutiny.
reports from ian rapoport on nfl network's nfl gameday morning suggest that owner arthur blank has implied that the incoming head coach will have a significant influence on dimitroff's future within the organization, as per sources close to blank.
until the new head coach is appointed and a mutual understanding is reached, dimitroff's status remains uncertain, as highlighted by rapoport.
arthur blank's ambiguous response regarding dimitroff's role during a press conference after smith's exit hinted at a potential shift in the front office structure.
despite dimitroff's accolades as a two-time nfl executive of the year and his reputation in scouting circles, blank's actions indicate a possible change within the organization.
whether blank's intentions signify a potential split or a reorganization of front office responsibilities remains to be seen.
one thing is certain - blank is actively involved in the coaching search process and is prepared to make the necessary decisions to secure the right candidate for the falcons.

at least 14 people have been reported dead in a terrorist attack carried out by the islamist group al-shabab at a hotel in the somali capital, mogadishu, as confirmed by the police.
after gunmen raided the naso-hablod hotel, security forces successfully regained control and rescued hostages.
the casualties, which include security personnel, civilians, and some of the assailants, show the brutal nature of the assault.
al-shabab insurgents, known for their attempts to overthrow the government backed by the west, have a history of launching frequent attacks in the city.
the tragic incident began when a suicide bomber detonated a car bomb at the hotel entrance, paving the way for the attackers to enter the premises.
once inside, witnesses described how the attackers indiscriminately fired at guests, causing chaos and terror.
a survivor, ali mohamud, recounted his escape through the back exit amid the gunfire.
subsequently, a fierce gun battle ensued between the militants and security forces.
the attackers numbered at least four men, with victims including female staff members outside the hotel, as reported by capt.
though it remains unclear whether any guests were among the fatalities, the naso-hablod hotel, located in southern mogadishu, is a frequent choice for politicians and tourists.
al-shabab stated that they targeted government officials who visit the hotel regularly, according to reuters.
this assault follows a recent attack claimed by al-shabab which resulted in the death of 10 individuals and the injury of 50 others at a different hotel in mogadishu.
despite being driven out of mogadishu in 2011, the al-qaeda-affiliated group still poses a significant threat and continues to perpetrate attacks within the city.

kenyan police have carried out early morning raids on two mosques in the coastal city of mombasa, where they discovered grenades and ammunition.
during the operation, one individual was fatally shot by the police, and over 250 individuals were taken into custody.
the masjid musa and shakinah mosques were reportedly found to be storing weapons, with authorities linking the masjid musa mosque to connections with the islamist militant group al-shabab, based in neighboring somalia.
since 2011, when kenyan troops entered somalia to combat al-shabab, the group has been responsible for numerous attacks in kenya.
among the items seized by the police at the mosques were a pistol, eight grenades, and an al-shabab-associated flag.
according to mombasa police chief geoffrey mayek, during the raid, one man was shot and killed after attempting to throw a hand grenade at officers.
notably, this is the second police raid on the masjid musa mosque this year, with reports suggesting its use as a hub for recruiting and training young individuals looking to join al-shabab.
civil society activist hussein khalid criticized the police's use of force during the raids, warning that it could further escalate the already tense situation.
the muslim human rights forum has also condemned the authorities for what they perceive as excessive use of force during the mosque raids.
additionally, mombasa has experienced several gun attacks this year, including the killings of both moderate and radical muslim clerics and an attack on a church by armed assailants.
despite allegations by some muslim leaders accusing security forces of involvement in the cleric killings, authorities have denied these claims.
al-shabab, which is arabic for "the youth," claims to be associated with al-qaeda and is estimated to have between 7,000 and 9,000 fighters.
andy murray, the current world number one in tennis, has withdrawn from his initial exhibition match at the hurlingham club due to a hip injury.
the british player, who was recently eliminated in the first round at queen's tournament, was set to face france's lucas pouille at the aspall tennis classic.
despite this setback, murray is anticipated to participate in another match on friday as part of his preparation for his wimbledon title defense, commencing on 3 july.
the 30-year-old's last appearance at hurlingham was in 2014 following his loss in the last 16 at queen's.
meanwhile, world number two, novak djokovic, had a brief encounter lasting only nine minutes against vasek pospisil from canada at eastbourne, with the game eventually being called off due to rain disruptions.
djokovic, competing in his first pre-wimbledon event in seven years, had to fend off two break points in his inaugural service game.
additionally, british players katie swan and tara moore faced defeats in the wimbledon qualifying rounds.
according to bbc tennis correspondent russell fuller, murray's decision to withdraw is deemed as "ultra-cautious," ensuring his fitness for the upcoming matches.
despite recent practice sessions at wimbledon alongside rising talent denis shapovalov, the disruption in his match schedule following the early exit at queen's club poses challenges as murray aims to gain momentum with a maximum of two grass matches ahead of wimbledon.

according to pqube, steins;gate 0 expands the acclaimed science fiction visual novel franchise with a gripping new story.
the original steins;gate had been highly praised for its character development and storytelling, earning it the title of the greatest visual novel.
steins;gate 0 continues this tradition by delving into an alternate world line where protagonist okabe rintaro faces a deep emotional struggle after failing to save the love of his life.
as he spirals into depression and abandons his companions and time-travel experiments, a series of events unfold that pose a threat to humanity.
can familiar characters like mayuri, farris, daru, moeka, luka, and suzuha bring him back from the brink?
the narrative also introduces new characters and scientific concepts combining time travel and artificial intelligence to deliver a darker, mind-blowing storyline for fans of the series.
check out the english trailer for a glimpse of what's to come.
the oxymoron "competing globally" from the abstract of the article on the front page is a concept that needs reconsideration.
operating in a globalized world implies that human society is now interconnected and interdependent across all facets of human life, forming a singular, fully integrated system.
despite ongoing debates in regions like europe about the necessary levels of integration to preserve unity, the reality is that the system we inhabit naturally encompasses comprehensive integration.
by clinging to the idea that individuals and nations can operate independently, we resist the evolutionary pressures of our existence.
a global, integral system thrives on cooperative interactions rather than cutthroat competition.
insisting on competition, as some experts still advocate, is akin to endorsing a destructive force over a healthy one.
this truth is increasingly apparent not just in theory but in current events, evident in daily news updates, statistical trends, and the evident desperation at high-stakes international meetings.
our only viable option is to willingly adapt to this system to unlock its vast potential.
embracing this cooperative paradigm could lead to unprecedented advantages within the global, integral, and natural system that surrounds us.
shifting away from perpetual conflicts, setbacks, and inefficiencies, we would seamlessly coexist by aligning with the system rather than working against it.
there are rumors circulating about a potential significant trade move involving star north melbourne ruckman todd goldstein heading to the west coast eagles.
watoday's brad hardie mentioned on the sports today program that goldstein, along with geelong's nathan vardy, underwent medical assessments by west coast's medical team.
speculation around goldstein intensified after the recent trade of sam mitchell to west coast, with sources suggesting that goldstein, a sought-after all-australian player, might be considering a move due to personal reasons.
hardie indicated that discussions about the trade have progressed further, despite concerns raised by fellow watoday writer kim hagdorn about fitting goldstein into the eagles' tight salary cap situation.
the upcoming sunday afternoon match against the melbourne storm presents an exciting opportunity for the club to reminisce about and rediscover the 1980s.
the game in round 7 will feature a celebration of 80s music, fashion, hairstyles, and more, allowing fans to immerse themselves in the nostalgia of that era.

for convenient access to the venue, attendees are recommended to utilize public transport, with the north leichhardt light rail stop conveniently located within walking distance of the game.
a group of engineers and designers from nasa's larc, clouds architecture office, and search collaborated on a new design, following their victory in nasa's centennial challenge with the 3d printed "mars ice house" habitat.
their fresh idea introduces a torus structure—an inflatable innertube surrounded by a shell made of water ice.
the design is not only lightweight but also incorporates materials sourced from mars itself.
the water lining serves a dual purpose of shielding against cosmic rays and potentially serving as rocket fuel for the mars ascent lander.
the concept, known as the mars ice home, comes with challenges, such as the significant time it would take to fill the ice shell with water directly from mars.
nevertheless, the potential solution involves using robots to inflate and pump the shelter while astronauts are en route.
the shielding properties of the water allow for the structure to be aboveground, eliminating the need to dig deep for protection.
while the ice home concept is still in its theoretical stages, it sparks innovation among designers and experts to come up with efficient solutions for the complexities of martian exploration.
due to a shortage of roman catholic clergy in the united states, priests from india have stepped in to perform masses for specific intentions, creating a form of outsourcing within the church.
churches from countries like the united states, canada, and europe send their requests, known as mass intentions, to indian clergy for services such as memorial prayers for deceased loved ones, thanksgiving prayers, and other special intentions.
india, with a christian population of about 2 percent, primarily catholics, sees a significant number of mass intentions coming from overseas, particularly from kerala, a state on the southwestern coast known for its high concentration of christians.
the masses are conducted in malayalam, the local language, with the intentions ranging from prayers for the deceased, healing of family members, gratitude for answered prayers, to blessings for newborns.
these requests are mostly channeled through channels like the vatican, bishops, or religious organizations to churches in kerala, with some received directly by individual priests.
while most requests are traditionally made in person or through mail by traveling clergy, there is an increasing trend of requests being sent via email, showcasing how technology is facilitating and expediting this practice.
htc announced that it would discontinue support for the sense tv app by the end of april in an update to the app.
sense tv was designed to work with the htc one m8's ir blaster, serving as an interactive tv guide.
users will now be transitioned to the peel app as a replacement for sense tv.
htc confirmed to windows central that following the discontinuation, users will receive prompts to download the peel app on both windows and android devices.
while both apps are essentially the same, the key distinction is that sense tv was a customized version with input from the taiwanese manufacturer.
although sense tv is currently still accessible in the windows phone store, there is no official listing for the peel app on windows yet.
it is hoped that the transition to the new app will be seamless well ahead of the shutdown.
the altai region in southern siberia has played a significant role in the settlement of northern asia and is believed to be a possible homeland for ancestral native americans.
with a long history dating back to the paleolithic era, the altai region is currently inhabited by various turkic-speaking ethnic groups, categorized into northern and southern clusters based on linguistic, cultural, and anthropological characteristics.
to explore the genetic histories of the altaians, we conducted a detailed analysis of mtdna and y chromosome variations among populations from both the northern and southern regions.
the mtdna analysis involved pcr-rflp and control region sequencing, while the y chromosome study included over 100 biallelic markers and 17 y-strs.
our findings revealed distinct differences in the origins and population histories of the altai ethnic groups, with northern altaians showing similarities to yeniseian, ugric, and samoyedic speakers to the north, while southern altaians displayed closer connections to other turkic-speaking populations in southern siberia and central asia.
additionally, through a thorough investigation of the y chromosome haplogroup q, we were able to revise the phylogeny of this lineage, establishing clearer links between populations in the old and new worlds and indicating a recent common ancestor shared between southern altaians and native americans.
these results significantly contribute to our comprehension of the migration patterns from siberia to the americas.
in washington, there is a prevailing belief that the us supreme court will ultimately determine the constitutionality of president obama's health care law once all appeals have been exhausted.
speculation abounds that the court may be evenly split, with four justices in favor of the law and four against, leaving the pivotal decision to supreme court justice anthony kennedy.
according to adam liptak, a partisan ruling by the court in this case would have detrimental effects on american jurisprudence.
on the other hand, harvard law school professor lawrence tribe disputes the notion of a single decisive vote and asserts that the court's ruling will be driven by precedent rather than political leanings.
it is anticipated that the supreme court will hear the case next year, potentially during the intensity of the presidential general election season, ensuring that whatever verdict is reached will swiftly become a significant political topic.

australians have expressed their anger over a company that hosts weekend war games in schools, which has been promoted as "ideal killing fields." a parents' association in queensland has labeled the promotions as highly inappropriate, with opposition education representatives criticizing the activities on school grounds, stating it sends the wrong message about combating school violence.
prime minister kevin rudd has questioned why schools permitted such events.
a queensland education spokesperson clarified that decisions on hiring school facilities for community events are made by school principals in consultation with local associations.
the company urban assault offers outdoor war games using laser guns, and its website advertises four schools in queensland as optimal battle zones.
one school on the gold coast is described as a "perfect urban assault battlefield," emphasizing long-range weapons and "setting up killing fields with gattling guns." the website displays images of individuals, both adults, and children, dressed in camouflage outfits and engaging in laser gun battles at the schools, claiming to possess the most advanced realistic guns in australia.

the state education department has requested that the company remove all school references from its advertising materials.
the 1990s is often regarded as the last true golden age for music.
this sentiment is not purely nostalgia but is shared by many younger music enthusiasts who hold a deep appreciation for the era.
while the past fourteen years have given rise to notable musical movements and classic albums, they have not matched the prolific creativity of the preceding decades.
in this article, we will highlight fifty albums from the 90s that have left a lasting musical legacy and made a significant cultural impact.
narrowing it down to just five albums per year is a daunting task considering the multitude of influential releases during that time.
the list is not ranked by importance but presented chronologically from 1990 to 1999.
some exceptional albums may not make the cut, as the focus is on the albums that best fit the given criteria.
for instance, as remarkable as 'let the rhythm hit 'em' by eric b and rakim from 1990 is, it may not hold the same weight as other releases from that year.

today's incarnation is guru nanak, a poet who founded sikhism in the 15th century, establishing one of the great world religions.
similar to historical figures such as the buddha and mahavira of jainism, nanak lived a nomadic life, traveling extensively for 25 years to places like mecca and the himalayas.
unlike his predecessors, upon attaining enlightenment, nanak returned to punjab, emphasizing to his followers the importance of engaging with the world rather than withdrawing from it.
he promoted a philosophy of 'disciplined worldliness,' highlighting the significance of work and family.
nanak also introduced the concept of langar, a communal meal served in sikh temples worldwide, where people of all backgrounds dine together as equals, transcending societal barriers.
sunil khilnani delves into the legacy of nanak, exploring his revolutionary ideas that challenged the existing religious norms.
by proclaiming "there is neither hindu nor muslim," nanak advocated for a distinct path rather than a blend of religions, ultimately founding a unique faith with approximately 30 million followers globally.

virginia tech researchers have developed cryo, an autonomous robot designed to mimic jellyfish movement using a flexible silicone hat.
the man-sized jellybot is a significant advancement from previous smaller versions, necessitating mock field tests in a swimming pool rather than a tank.
cryo is powered by batteries, a departure from recent passively propelled robots, with the goal of mirroring the energy-efficient nature of jellyfish movement to potentially extend its charge cycle to months.
the larger size of these robotic jellyfish allows for increased range, with potential applications in ocean monitoring and oil spill cleanup.
funded by the us navy, there is interest in utilizing these robots for underwater surveillance due to their natural appearance.
you can observe cryo in action in the video below.
the board of commissioners of public lands, a state agency that provides loans and grants to schools and local governments, is currently in need of a permanent leader after tia nelson resigned as executive secretary in july amid a dispute over discussing climate change.
state treasurer matt adamczyk's attempt to silence nelson led to her resignation.

a somali man, jama idle ibrahim, has confessed to attacking a us warship in april after mistakenly identifying it as a merchant vessel.
along with five accomplices, ibrahim chased the uss ashland and opened fire on it before being apprehended, as detailed in court documents.
he has pleaded guilty to piracy-related charges in norfolk, virginia, and is now facing a potential 30-year prison sentence.
five other somali individuals are also facing legal actions in connection with the incident.
prosecutors emphasized that this is norfolk's first piracy-related conviction in 150 years and stressed the importance of holding modern-day pirates accountable.
following an agreement with authorities, ibrahim pleaded guilty to charges including attacking to plunder a vessel, committing violence against individuals on a vessel, and using a firearm during a violent crime.
both ibrahim and the authorities have concurred on a 30-year imprisonment term, with a sentencing hearing scheduled for 29 november.
recently, a piracy charge carrying a mandatory life sentence was dismissed against ibrahim and his alleged accomplices by a judge.
the group attacked the uss ashland in the gulf of aden on 10 april using a skiff to fire upon it.
in response, us navy personnel returned fire, leading to the death of one somali and destruction of their skiff.
the judge nullified the more severe piracy accusation as the group did not steal from, board, or take control of the us navy ship.
somalia has been plagued by internal conflicts for over two decades, fostering a breeding ground for piracy due to the prevailing lawlessness.
typically, foreign countries have been hesitant to prosecute suspects domestically, allowing pirates to evade consequences even after failed attacks.

in what has been described as one of the most severe cases of child abuse witnessed in australia, a group of 12 children aged between five and 16 have been taken out of an extended family in south-west nsw.
they were residing on a farm under primitive conditions within what appears to be an incestuous community.
in a september session at the children's court, judge peter johnstone made a decision to permanently separate the children, using pseudonyms to protect their identities, from the four mothers involved.
the ruling was based on evidence of "intergenerational incest," with the judge noting that the mothers' failure to acknowledge their own traumatic experiences rendered them unable to shield their children from ongoing sexual abuse.

according to a senior official from a private sector bank, banks have implemented a new rule prohibiting borrowers from using personal loans to purchase gold.
this measure is part of an effort to reduce the demand for gold, with banks now specifying that loan proceeds, including personal loans, must not be used for buying gold exceeding the approved limits.
this directive is in response to the reserve bank of india's instructions to banks and nbfcs to control the demand for gold, which had contributed to widening the current account deficit.
the guidelines stipulate that banks cannot grant loans for the acquisition of any form of gold, such as primary gold, gold bullion, gold jewelry, gold coins, units of gold exchange-traded funds, or units of gold mutual funds.
furthermore, the rbi has imposed a restriction on the weight of specially minted gold coins that can be used as collateral, with a limit of 50 grams per customer as noted by a senior official from a public bank.
in a recent development, the rbi has limited gold imports by banks to cater exclusively to the requirements of gold jewelry exporters, and has also banned the import of gold coins and medallions without the necessary license.
to ensure domestic utilization, nominated banks, agencies, and other entities are advised to supply gold only to jewelry businesses, bullion dealers, and banks authorized under the gold deposit scheme, against full upfront payment.
the government has also increased the import duty on gold to 10 percent as part of its strategies to control imports.
notably, gold imports saw a significant rise in july to 47 tonnes compared to 31 tonnes in the previous month, contributing to an 87 percent increase in gold imports from april to july, totaling 383 tonnes.
barcelona has announced that they will be hosting chapecoense in a friendly match on 7 august as a tribute to the victims of the brazilian team's tragic plane crash last november.
the crash, which occurred on 29 november, resulted in the loss of 71 out of 77 individuals on board, leaving only three players of the club surviving.
barcelona's intention in organizing the game is to support chapecoense in their process of institutional recovery and restoring their competitive level following the disaster.
the match, scheduled to take place at the nou camp, will also determine the recipient of the joan gamper trophy, an annual tradition where barcelona traditionally presents their new season lineup to their home supporters.
the fatal crash happened en route to chapecoense's match against colombian team atletico nacional in the copa sudamericana final.
among the six survivors were defenders neto and alan ruschel, and goalkeeper jackson follmann, who unfortunately had to undergo a leg amputation.
the team has since made significant changes by welcoming 25 new players and promoting nine from their youth squad.
a recent study conducted by researchers from the university of alberta has unveiled the mystery behind the popping sound produced when cracking knuckles.
according to lead author and u of a professor greg kawchuk, the sound is a result of a momentary vacuum-like gap forming in the lubricating synovial fluid between the finger and knuckle bones when the joints are pulled apart too far, creating a gas-filled space that triggers the sound.
kawchuk hopes that this new understanding could lead to advancements in joint health, offering better insights into spinal injuries, knee problems, and other joint-related issues long before symptoms manifest.
using mri scans to capture a knuckle cracking in slow motion, kawchuk's international team of scientists observed a brief dark pocket forming between the knuckle and finger bones as they were separated, followed by a flash of white just before the crack occurred.
this discovery, never seen before, provides a foundation for further exploration using advanced mri technology.
the study confirmed that the force generated during knuckle cracking is potent enough to harm hard surfaces, yet medical research has not found any adverse effects on individuals who engage in this habit.
kawchuk anticipates that these research findings will pave the way for more studies on joint health and arthritic pain, suggesting a potential link between the ability to crack knuckles and joint well-being.
the study, shedding light on the mechanisms behind knuckle cracking, was detailed in the april 15 issue of the journal plos one.
it is difficult to determine which aspect of the resolution presented and referred to committee on wednesday by a member of the 87th arkansas general assembly was more noteworthy.
the resolution itself, designated as hjr 1009, seeks to amend the arkansas constitution by revoking the prohibition against atheists holding office in the civil departments of the state or testifying as witnesses in court.
equally remarkable is the fact that this resolution was introduced by the highest-ranking elected official of the green party in the united states, state representative richard carroll of north little rock.

staff at one counterfeit apple store in kunming were clad in outfits resembling those worn by authentic employees.
in kunming, a total of 22 fraudulent apple stores were exposed by authorities.
the investigation was triggered by the dissemination of images showcasing a remarkably authentic replica.
initially, five illicit stores were identified, leading to the closure of two for operating without a proper license.
chinese trade officials subsequently confirmed that 22 unlawful establishments were appropriating apple's brand and logo.
the scrutiny of unauthorized apple stores in kunming was instigated after an american resident published a blog post narrating a visit to one such store.
the blog post, which described the imitation as a "beautiful rip-off," detailed the meticulous replication of the genuine apple store's decor and ambiance.
employees were observed donning identical colored t-shirts and sporting lanyards mirroring those of actual apple staff.
the blog post garnered significant global attention, prompting chinese trade authorities in kunming to take swift action.
the local administration for industry and commerce uncovered multiple shops infringing on apple's registered trademarks.
these offending stores have been instructed to cease using the logos, as chinese laws prohibit the imitation of another company's "look and feel" without authorization.
the source of products sold by these retailers – whether sourced from apple's authorized distributors or the grey market – remains unclear.
the kunming retail watchdog has pledged to intensify monitoring efforts and has established a hotline for the public to report unauthorized apple outlets.

after a brisbane magistrate dismissed charges against four individuals for engaging in 'satanic' vandalism at toowong cemetery last year, the group, consisting of zoe louise wilson, benjamin lionel garland, shane alan bell, and michael john smallbon, was acquitted due to lack of evidence demonstrating they did not have permission to carry out the act.
the quartet, initially accused of willfully damaging 82 graves in the historic cemetery back in august, were released without any charges after appearing in brisbane magistrates court.
the court was informed that one of the individuals had made statements about desecrating graves by inverting crucifixes, claiming it was significant to satanists.
however, following testimonies from multiple witnesses during a committal hearing, the defense for the accused successfully argued that there was insufficient grounds to pursue a case against their clients.
according to the new york times, the nfl is set to notify teams on tuesday about adjustments to the positioning of the umpire in the offensive backfield.
these changes are a response to the recent rule modification that shifted the umpire from the heart of the defense to a position 14 to 17 yards behind the offense for safety purposes.
following the hall of fame game, the placement was altered to 12 yards back to expedite ball spotting.
despite this modification, the rule faced backlash from indianapolis colts quarterback peyton manning after his team received penalties for snapping the ball before the umpire was properly positioned during a preseason match on thursday.
subsequent modifications, established after a conference call involving members of the league's competition committee, now stipulate that the umpire should only be positioned behind the farthest offensive player.
quarterbacks are allowed to glance at officials by the sidelines for approval to snap the ball, eliminating the need to turn around and search for a signal from the umpire.

during medieval times, readers expected that books would feature both text and images.
to meet this expectation, printers swiftly incorporated woodcut images in between blocks of text, paving the way for a more efficient process that eliminated the need for hand-painting.
this method not only saved valuable time and money but also maintained the essential text and illustration format that remained significant during the renaissance period.
historically, about one-third of all incunabula, books printed before the year 1501, were illustrated, and the practice of hand-coloring images persisted up until the 18th century.
despite printing being in its early stages before 1501, the method of using movable type on a wooden press remained largely unchanged for the next 350 years.
progress was seen in the book format, with the introduction of title pages - a departure from medieval scribes who traditionally added their names, completion dates, and sometimes a brief prayer at the end of manuscripts.
by the early 16th century, page numbers had become a standard feature in books.
tucker carlson: could it be that france's challenges stem from its sizable muslim population, a byproduct of its immigration policies?
should we be reconsidering immigration strategies in europe and north america, taking into account the backgrounds of incoming individuals?

what benefits do we gain from this approach?
such queries are likely to surface in the near future.
those advocating for a realistic view on diversity seek to raise these important concerns.
ultimately, due to the totalitarian nature of islam as a political ideology, some argue that muslims may not be the most suitable candidates for immigration to western countries.

officials in bihar, northern india, have reported that a tragic stampede at a hindu religious festival in the state capital of patna has claimed the lives of at least 32 individuals, with many of the victims being women and children.
anjani kumar singh, bihar's chief secretary, informed the bbc that 24 others sustained injuries and were rushed to a local hospital.
the stampede occurred during festivities for the dussehra festival at patna's gandhi maidan.
the exact cause of the stampede remains unclear, but eyewitnesses told of a chaotic scene where panic ensued after news circulated among the crowd that an electrical wire had fallen.
reports suggest the stampede originated in a narrow path as the throngs were dispersing from the event venue.
journalist niraj sahay, present at the venue, detailed that only one exit had been opened for people to exit, leading to the overcrowding that exacerbated the tragic incident.
the incident serves as a grim reminder of the dangers associated with large gatherings during hindu festivals in india, which sometimes witness poor crowd management and have previously resulted in significant casualties.
tragically, similar stampedes have marred previous hindu festivals, including a somber event in august when 10 individuals lost their lives in a stampede during the somvati amavasya festival in central india and a devastating incident in october 2013 where 91 pilgrims perished in a stampede near the ratangarh temple in madhya pradesh state.

san francisco is contemplating a new law that would prevent delivery robots from operating on the city's sidewalks.
the robots, previously only seen in science fiction films, are now being tested in real life.
supervisor norman yee introduced legislation on tuesday to prohibit these robots from traversing san francisco's streets.
yee, speaking to the san francisco chronicle, mentioned that while he initially thought about regulating the robots, he ultimately deemed that enforcing rules would be impractical.
"i want to ensure the safety of our sidewalks for everyone," yee stated.
he emphasized that seniors, children, and individuals with disabilities may find it challenging to avoid these robots.
food delivery startup marble currently utilizes a few robots to carry out deliveries in san francisco's mission and potrero hill neighborhoods.
these robots, standing slightly over 4 feet tall and mounted on an electric wheelchair base, can accommodate up to four grocery bags.
equipped with various sensors, including lidar technology similar to that used in self-driving cars, the robots are designed to navigate city sidewalks.
they operate at a gentle pace of 3 to 4 miles per hour.
the ceo of marble emphasized their commitment to safety, expressing willingness to collaborate with supervisors, local groups, and others to create well-informed regulations that strike a balance between pedestrian safety, local businesses, manufacturing, and innovation.
website owners can now gain valuable insights into the traffic their websites receive from twitter with the introduction of twitter web analytics, a new tool unveiled on tuesday.
developed by backtype, a social analytics company acquired by twitter in july, this tool aims to provide website owners with enhanced data on the effectiveness of their twitter integrations.
christopher golda, founder of backtype and now a member of the twitter platform team, highlighted that twitter web analytics will offer insights on three crucial aspects: the extent to which their content is shared on twitter, the volume of traffic driven by twitter, and the performance of tweet buttons.
this beta tool is currently available to a select group of partners with a wider rollout to all website owners expected in the coming weeks.
additionally, an api will be made accessible to developers for further integration and analysis.
due to weather disruptions affecting the usual transport routes, a retailer responded swiftly by air-lifting food supplies to shetland.
the severe weather conditions led to a halt in ferry and freight boat services to and from the islands for two days.
with operator serco northlink indicating no possible transport options until christmas eve at the earliest, tesco stepped in to address the critical shortage that left islanders with empty shelves.
the company arranged for a chartered plane, a hercules transporter, to replenish the food supplies.
flying from norway to edinburgh, the plane was swiftly loaded with food and headed to shetland on a saturday afternoon.
in a rare move, the department for transport waived restrictions to allow the urgent flight from edinburgh airport, recognizing the emergency situation on shetland.
another hercules delivery was scheduled for saturday evening to further assist in restocking essential supplies.
in arlington, texas, the 1996 murder of a young girl from north texas, which sparked the development of the amber alert notification system to aid in locating missing children, remains unresolved.
police in arlington reiterated their plea for information in the investigation into the killing of 9-year-old amber hagerman.
amber's mother, donna williams, also made an emotional appeal for justice for her daughter.
this year marks the 20th anniversary since amber was taken while riding her bike in arlington.
her body was discovered four days later in a drainage ditch with her throat slit.
following the incident, local radio and tv stations in the dallas-fort worth region collaborated to broadcast alerts in a joint effort to locate amber, leading to the establishment of the now national amber alert system for child abductions.
since its inception in 1996, the system has played a significant role in successfully reuniting 794 missing children with their families, as per data shared on social media platforms by the national center for missing and exploited children.
in texas, wednesday is observed as amber alert awareness day.
after just a year at the helm, ac milan manager filippo inzaghi is set to be dismissed this week.
the serie a club confirmed to bbc sport that the 41-year-old will not continue to lead the team into the upcoming season following their disappointing 10th-place finish in the league, failing to secure a spot in the champions league.
despite carlo ancelotti declining a return to his former club, ex-sampdoria manager sinisa mihajlovic is the frontrunner for the position.
milan is actively seeking a new coach, with an official announcement anticipated on friday.
mihajlovic, who recently announced his departure from sampdoria after steering them to a seventh-place finish, is rumoured to be in negotiations to succeed inzaghi.
ancelotti, who recently departed real madrid, engaged in discussions with milan's chief executive adriano galliani but expressed a need for a break following his tenure at the bernabeu.
inzaghi, the former italy striker, oversaw milan's poorest league standing in nearly two decades.
halo's multiplayer experience has consistently charmed players with its distinctive elements.
the restriction to carrying only two weapons along with the meticulous balance between firearms, explosives, and close combat mechanics form the foundation of its allure.
however, what truly sets halo apart is its inclusion of iconic vehicles paired with a diverse arsenal of purposeful weapons, establishing itself as a premier multiplayer hub globally.
halo 4 injected new vitality into the long-standing franchise by introducing an upgrade system, customizable loadouts, and the incorporation of perks.
while these innovations may draw parallels to elements from call of duty, halo 4 expertly integrates them with its unique touch, preserving the essence of the halo universe.
the game is further elevated by a rich selection of maps, a component that was lacking in reach, and the continuation of its unmatched social and matchmaking features.
with its captivating multiplayer dynamics, halo 4 remains a title that keeps players engaged night after night.
a tragic incident at a cricket match in the city of ashdod, israel resulted in the death of umpire hillel oscar after he was struck by a ball.
the bowler's shot hit oscar in the neck, possibly deflected from the stumps at his end of the pitch.
this unfortunate event occurred just two days after the passing of australian cricketer phillip hughes, who succumbed to a head injury following a similar ball impact during a match in sydney.
unlike players, cricket umpires traditionally do not wear helmets, making such occurrences exceptionally rare.
five years prior, an umpire in wales also lost his life when struck by a ball thrown by a fielder.
oscar, a former captain of the israeli national cricket team, was rushed to a local hospital but sadly could not be resuscitated.
the match took place on saturday, marking the end of israel's league season.
while cricket is not a prominent sport in israel, an amateur league exists mainly comprised of players from countries like india, south africa, australia, and new zealand.
this incident has deeply saddened and shocked the cricket community worldwide, especially coming so close to the tragic death of phillip hughes.
hughes, an australian cricketer, passed away two days after being hit on the neck by a delivery in a game in australia, with his funeral scheduled for wednesday.
a fierce battle for control of palmyra in syria has been fluctuating between government forces and isil fighters.
moscow reported that its airstrikes contributed to driving the hardline islamists out of the ancient city overnight.
the russian defence ministry stated that their jets conducted 64 sorties during the operation, resulting in the death of over 300 militants.
nonetheless, a news agency associated with the islamic state claimed that the militants had regained control of palmyra after a brief retreat.
this assertion was supported by the british-based syrian observatory for human rights, a conflict observer.
isil initiated a surprise attack on the unesco world heritage site last week, where they seized adjacent oil and gas fields.
the syrian army apparently dispatched reinforcements to palmyra, which isil had initially captured in may 2015 before being ousted in march of this year.
the attorney-general has been informed that crown prosecutor margaret cunneen will not face charges as a result of allegations brought forth by the independent commission against corruption (icac).
nsw solicitor-general michael sexton, sc, released a statement on friday revealing that after considering advice from the victorian chief crown prosecutor, it was decided that no prosecution should proceed.
the icac had referred evidence to the nsw director of public prosecutions following an inquiry into ms.
cunneen, sc, her son stephen wyllie, and his girlfriend sophia tilley.
the high court had halted the icac's investigation, determining it had exceeded its legal authority.
the allegations centered around accusations that the trio had attempted to pervert the course of justice and provided false information to the icac following a car accident in may of the previous year.
friday marked the conclusion of a poignant chapter for four veterans whose bodies were left unattended in the shawnee co.
morgue for an extended period until intervention from a state veterans group led to their dignified burials at leavenworth national cemetery.
braving harsh weather conditions with temperatures at a bone-chilling 9 degrees, veterans' organizations and members of the community gathered outside amidst biting winds and snow to bid a final farewell to these veterans.
the episode began when it was discovered last december that five veterans had been forgotten and left unclaimed in the morgue, prompting the state commission for veterans affairs to intervene.
following these efforts, vietnam veterans clarke paul gould and robert lee norris, alongside fellow veterans ramsey phillips and james allen young, were laid to rest with military honors at leavenworth national cemetery.
the commission on veterans affairs immediately took action upon learning of the unclaimed veterans, collaborating with shawnee co.
and penwell gabel funeral home to ensure the veterans were prepared and honored in a befitting manner at their burial.
last week, judge lucy koh instructed apple and samsung to reduce the number of patent claims in their ongoing northern district of california legal battle.
both companies have now followed this directive, with samsung cutting its asserted patent claims from 75 to 15 and dropping two patents from the case.
apple, on the other hand, has streamlined its case to one claim per utility patent, four iphone and one ipad design patents, and trade dress claims for these devices.
importantly, these reductions were made without prejudice, allowing either party to reintroduce dismissed claims in the future.
despite this, the companies' efforts to comply with the judge's orders signal their desire to maintain the scheduled july 30 trial date, marking the start of more intense legal proceedings.
for more detailed information, the complete filings can be reviewed below.
the new york assembly has made progress towards passing a bill that would mandate labels on food products containing genetically modified crop ingredients.
the assembly's consumer affairs and protection committee approved the measure on tuesday, although a full assembly vote has yet to be scheduled.
advocates argue that the labels would provide valuable information to consumers.
on the other hand, many agricultural and food companies dispute the need for labeling, pointing out the lack of scientific evidence supporting the notion that genetically engineered foods are harmful.
if passed, the bill would cover genetically modified fruits, vegetables, processed foods, and products containing ingredients such as oil or sugar derived from genetically engineered crops.
vermont has already implemented a labeling law, while maine and connecticut have also passed similar legislation, albeit with delayed enforcement pending action by other states.
french investigators reported that a tragic incident occurred in la verriere village near paris when a family of 11 individuals mistakenly believed a man to be the devil and attempted to escape him by throwing themselves from a third-floor flat.
the unfortunate event unfolded when firefighters responded to a call about multiple individuals jumping from a balcony in a welfare housing block.
among the injured were an unclothed man of african descent with a hand injury and two children, a baby and a two-year-old girl.
tragically, the baby succumbed to injuries despite medical treatment in paris.
according to assistant prosecutor odile faivre, the incident transpired during the early hours while the group, consisting of 13 individuals, were watching television in an apartment.
when the naked man, intending to prepare a bottle for the baby, stood up, his wife mistook him for the devil, causing panic and leading to the sorrowful outcome.
the devastation caused by a previous bombing of khuza'a, a small farming town located less than half a mile from gaza's southeastern border with israel, is evident.
the intense attack that began on july 20 decimated much of khuza'a - resulting in whole streets being flattened, once-majestic mosque domes brought to ground level, and the local council's sign, "bon voyage khusa'a," lying in pieces at the town entrance.
one resident vividly remembered counting 360 shell attacks in just one hour.
the majority of khuza'a's 14,000 residents evacuated in three phases, while those who later returned described the relentless attacks from all directions on the town situated a few miles north of rafah.
despite the israeli army largely halting its fire during a seven-hour "humanitarian window" on monday, the bombardment continued in the southeastern city of rafah, with unconfirmed reports suggesting the tragic death of a british aid worker on the previous sunday.
recent criticism has been directed towards the prolonged period it takes for lapped cars to unlapped themselves and rejoin the back of the field in formula 1 races.
at times, backmarkers have taken multiple laps to catch up, causing delays for race director charlie whiting to restart the race.
to address this issue, a proposal has been put forward to discuss potential solutions during a sporting regulations working group meeting at the brazilian grand prix.
one approach under consideration is for lapped cars to drop back to the rear of the field instead of unlapping themselves.
in this scenario, these cars would be given an additional lap to prevent them from being disadvantaged.
such a system could facilitate quicker race restarts within a single lap of receiving the instruction, thereby reducing the time taken to bring in the safety car.
the meeting will also cover topics such as revisions to f1's engine penalty regulations, the adequacy of the current five-second penalty for driving violations, the possibility of utilizing current cars in show events, and potential changes to parc ferme restrictions.
whenever a game emerges on the steam apps database, exercising a level of skepticism is prudent.
this advice applies to the walking dead: 400 days, a downloadable content entry connected to telltale's acclaimed zombie narrative.
despite the general caution, there are indications supporting the validity of this prospect.
this speculation is bolstered by the enigmatic vine teasers showcased on telltale's twitter account, with four released so far, portraying names and images affixed to a virtual noticeboard labeled as day 2, day 220, day 184, and day 236.
telltale has previously hinted at intermediate content bridging the gap between the first and second seasons of the walking dead series.
with telltale's presence at e3 imminent, it is possible that official announcements may be made shortly.

a chinese businessman, su bin, has been charged by us authorities for allegedly hacking into the computer systems of boeing and other defense contract firms.
su bin, who was arrested in canada the previous month, is accused of collaborating with two other individuals to unlawfully obtain data regarding military projects and selling it to china.
the prosecutors stated that the information targeted by mr.
su included details about fighter jets, military cargo aircraft, and various weapons.
a 2013 us report highlighted the increasing threat of industrial espionage from china.
although there is no specific accusation of the chinese government's involvement in su's case, the us has accused china of consistently engaging in the theft of american high-tech data for national benefit.
the us department of justice recently indicted five chinese military officers for hacking into us businesses, charges that were denied by china as unfounded.
su is purportedly the owner of a chinese aviation technology company with a presence in canada.
he was apprehended on june 28 while in the process of seeking canadian citizenship.
reports suggest that he and his alleged co-conspirators attempted to sell the stolen data to state-owned companies in china.
the justice department expressed serious concerns about the theft of sensitive information through cyber means and emphasized their commitment to utilizing all available resources to address cyber-security issues and criminal activities.
boeing released a statement affirming their cooperation with the us authorities to hold accountable individuals involved in economic espionage or trade secret theft against american companies.
su bin is expected to appear in court for a bail hearing next week.

he explains that the strategy of reducing taxes without generating additional revenue sources is based on the assumption that the tax cuts will eventually be covered by future surpluses.
however, he expresses doubts about the feasibility of achieving a surplus by 2018-19, deeming it "highly unlikely." he notes that for the government to implement tax cuts without exacerbating the budget deficit, an alternative would involve further reducing state funding for essential services, such as hospitals and schools.
emphasizing that the criterion for tax reductions should not be the potential for surplus in the distant future but rather the current budget surplus, mr.
he highlighted that the government could facilitate more tax reductions immediately by reducing existing commonwealth allocations for schools and hospitals even further and shifting the burden onto the states.
nonetheless, he critiqued this approach as lacking in leadership and criticized it as an intensified form of cost-shifting.
let's take a break from the anxiety-inducing doomsday headlines for a brief moment and focus on some positive news right in our own community.

this news comes as a breath of fresh air, especially at a time when we could all use some good news.
the iconic store will be under new management, highly praised for their successful revival of the neighboring texas theatre, a historic landmark that also faced the threat of disappearing in a city inclined to forget its heritage.
the decision to preserve top ten records, despite recent property acquisitions by investors in the area, is not only significant but also a source of great relief.
in a controversial ruling, a court in germany has determined that performing circumcision on young boys for religious grounds constitutes bodily harm.
this decision has sparked criticism from jewish and muslim communities, as the court emphasized the child's right to physical integrity over parental and religious freedoms.
the case involved a doctor who conducted a circumcision on a four-year-old resulting in medical complications.
while male circumcision is permissible in germany unlike female genital mutilation, the court argued that the child's fundamental right to bodily autonomy supersedes parental rights.
it stated that the child should have the freedom to decide on religious matters in later years.
while the doctor in question was acquitted and the ruling is not legally binding, it sets a precedent for future cases in german courts.
the central council of jews president expressed concern over the impact on religious autonomy and called on the parliament to safeguard religious freedoms.
this debate on male circumcision, an ancient tradition in jewish and muslim faiths, as well as cultural practice, is complex and sensitive, with uncertain legal outcomes ahead.
in this country, the prevailing belief is that trump is unlikely to win.
however, a recent quinnipiac poll released today shows trump leading clinton in the critical swing states of florida and pennsylvania, and tied in ohio, even with the inclusion of fringe candidates.
this shift in poll numbers underscores trump's lead in all three states.
despite this development, it is unlikely that the media will give this story significant attention, reminiscent of their skepticism towards trump's chances of securing the republican nomination, which he ultimately clinched.
trump's surge in popularity could be compared to the brexit phenomenon.
there is a tangible possibility that by november, despite dimon and clinton's attempts to appeal to the working class with wage increases, they may find themselves in a situation similar to that of david cameron and the uk banking establishment a few weeks ago.
colombia's former head of secret police, maria del pilar hurtado, has been convicted of illegally spying on politicians, judges, and journalists.
the supreme court will reveal her sentence in 15 days.
the spying activities, conducted from 2007 to 2008, specifically targeted political adversaries of then-president alvaro uribe.
bernardo moreno, uribe's former chief of staff, has also been found guilty, although uribe has denied any involvement in the illicit surveillance.
both hurtado and moreno face prison terms exceeding 10 years.
the unanimous decision by all nine supreme court justices, who were not among the targets, supports the convictions.
while moreno is out on bail pending sentencing, hurtado is currently in custody.
hurtado absconded from colombia in 2010 after the allegations surfaced once uribe stepped down from office.
she sought refuge in panama but surrendered to authorities following the revocation of her asylum last month.
uribe, now an opposition senator to president juan manuel santos, held office from 2002 to 2010.
notably, his former agriculture minister has been convicted of corruption, and various other ex-officials under him are under investigation for similar charges.
researchers in melbourne have identified the immune system's "kill switch," responsible for destroying blood stem cells during infection or chemotherapy.
published in the journal immunity, scientists at the walter and eliza hall institute of medical research revealed that this mechanism, while necessary for protecting the body during infection, can be detrimental when it becomes excessive, especially in cancer patients and those with sepsis.
by preventing these signals, researchers were able to halt the self-destruction of blood stem cells, prevent cell death post-chemotherapy, and enhance recovery from infections.
these findings offer promising prospects for developing treatments for sepsis and improving recovery outcomes in patients undergoing chemotherapy.
police have released cctv footage showcasing a terrifying incident in which schoolchildren narrowly escaped being struck by a motorbike that crashed into a car at an intersection in brisbane.
the event occurred last thursday at approximately 3:20 pm in lutwyche, located in the northern part of brisbane.
the footage captures two motorbikes heading south on gympie road towards lutwyche road, with one of the bikes running through the intersection of kedron park road and colliding with a car.
in the dramatic video, four schoolchildren crossing the street are nearly hit as the motorbike and its rider skid past them.
the 23-year-old male motorbike rider sustained severe leg injuries and is currently hospitalized at the royal brisbane and women's hospital in stable condition.
the police have shared the video in hopes of locating witnesses who may possess additional footage of the incident or those who were at the pedestrian crossing during the event.
a spokesperson from the queensland police service emphasized that the footage serves as a cautionary reminder for individuals to exercise vigilance.
anyone with information that can aid the investigation is urged to contact crime stoppers at 1800 333 000 or through their website.
newport news shipbuilding relocated the former uss enterprise within the shipyard on wednesday to resume the process of inactivating it and preparing for its eventual departure from hampton roads.
tugboats were employed to transfer the world's first nuclear-powered carrier from a dry dock to pier 2, according to company spokesperson christie miller.
following the completion of all dry dock-related tasks, the vessel's relocation to the pier will enable the shipyard to finalize the remaining procedures associated with its inactivation.
among these tasks are closing compartments and undertaking preparatory work for dismantling and towing, as explained by miller.
this relocation also serves to vacate the dry dock in anticipation of the arrival of the uss george washington, scheduled to undergo its mid-life overhaul in newport news later this year.
the historic enterprise, slated for recycling, does not yet have a definitive disposal plan confirmed by the navy.
although nuclear-powered warships typically find their resting place at the puget sound naval shipyard and intermediate maintenance facility in washington state, alternatives for the enterprise's disposal are being considered.
the navy had initially sought proposals from private industry for the recycling of the ship in august 2016, but subsequently canceled the request in february, opting to defer a decision on the preferred approach.
in the interim, the enterprise will be kept in temporary storage until a disposal plan is determined.
currently, there is no update on the location of the temporary storage or the timing of the navy's decision-making process.
bill couch, a spokesperson for naval sea systems command, affirmed on wednesday that the navy continues to gather information.
the newport news-built ship, which concluded over 50 years of service to the nation upon its decommissioning in february, remains in a state of limbo awaiting its final fate.
a concerning examination of the dwindling wildlife populations in the uk reveals a broader impact beyond just preserving nature's aesthetic appeal - the security of our food sources may be at risk.
envision a world where the oceans are barren, the skies devoid of wildlife sounds, and a scarcity of pollinating insects endangers our crops.
such a future for britain is foreseen if the current trend of diminishing biodiversity persists, affecting creatures ranging from butterflies and bumblebees to skylarks and red squirrels.
in 2010, the uk failed to meet two international objectives that aimed to halt the decline of cherished native species.
the crux, as uncovered by panorama, is not solely about safeguarding nature's beauty but also about safeguarding our food supply for the coming generations.
tim farrar, a satellite communications consultant based in menlo park, california, is part of a team of satellite experts investigating the possible location of flight 370.
he expressed surprise that the search area had not been extended further southwest.
the aircraft vanished on march 8 with 239 individuals on board during a flight from kuala lumpur, malaysia, to beijing.
farrar noted that the current search location aligns with the theory that the plane traveled south at a speed of approximately 380 knots after disappearing from malaysian radar near the northern end of the strait of malacca.
while the sea floor area examined in april and may, following acoustic pings detected by us navy contractors, suggested a slower speed of 325 knots, farrar and his independent expert team operated on the assumption of a faster speed ranging from 460 to 470 knots.
farrar questioned why the search efforts seemed geared towards a slower trajectory.
he speculated that this discrepancy could be due to authorities considering scenarios where the plane veered west before turning south or did not follow a linear route.
the australian government has announced plans to reveal the updated search area by the month's end.
karnataka governor vajubhai rudabhai vala highlighted that education in indian culture and tradition aimed at refinement should not be labeled as 'saffronisation'.
he emphasized the importance of including aspects of indian culture and refinement in education despite objections.
vala, speaking at the centenary celebrations of vivekananda degree and pre-university college, stressed the need to pass on the education and cultural values from ancestors to the next generation.
he underscored the significance of teaching the philosophies of spiritual leaders such as shankaracharya, bhagawan mahaveer, and buddha to the youth, asserting that this should not be mistaken for saffronisation.
the governor also praised vivekananda college for its contributions in educating over 30,000 students.
in an ironic twist, a sacramento web designer named john marcotte is making a humorous yet thought-provoking attempt to introduce a ballot measure in california that would prohibit divorce.
this proposed 2010 california marriage protection act is intended as a satirical response to the banning of gay marriage in 2008, with the argument that if protecting traditional marriage is paramount, then prohibiting divorce should logically follow.
marcotte, a 38-year-old married father of two, believes that since california opted to defend traditional marriage, it would be inconsistent not to relinquish some individual rights to further uphold it.
the uk police have re-arrested lauri love, a british man residing in stradishall, suffolk, for allegedly hacking into us government computer networks, such as the us army, nasa, and the us federal reserve.
following an extradition warrant requested by the us, the met police detained love at his residence on ash walk.
love, 30, appeared at westminster magistrates' court where he was subsequently granted bail until his next hearing scheduled for 1 september.
love's solicitor, karen todner, expressed surprise at his re-arrest and stated that he plans to contest the extradition.
love had previously been arrested in 2013, had computer equipment confiscated by british authorities, and was released on bail.
despite his bail being revoked over a year ago, no further action was taken until his recent re-arrest.
prior to this incident, love had sought the return of his seized computer equipment from the uk's national crime agency, eventually receiving most of it back before dropping his lawsuit.

a recent associated press report reveals that a member of al-qaeda, who is an american citizen, has been pinpointed in a hostile foreign nation.
the obama administration is currently grappling with the complex legal ramifications of potentially taking lethal action against him.
the cia has identified the individual as actively planning attacks in a country that denies us military intervention on its territory.
however, the administration is awaiting a review from the justice department before making any decisions.
despite the pentagon's approval of the use of lethal force, the prospect of a drone strike on an american national has engendered previous challenges from both congress and federal courts.
critics argue that such actions might violate the constitutional right to due process.
in response to these concerns, the president has recently implemented stricter oversight measures for drone strikes and the use of lethal force, which will be tested in this ongoing scenario.
this case notably evokes similarities to the 2009 drone strike that targeted and killed anwar al-awlaki, marking the sole prior instance of a us citizen being deliberately eliminated in such a manner.

scientists have successfully integrated human genes into 300 dairy cows, enabling them to produce milk that mirrors the properties of human breast milk.
with high levels of essential nutrients, human breast milk has the potential to enhance infants' immune systems and lower the chances of infections.
the researchers involved in this groundbreaking study envision that milk from genetically modified cow herds could serve as a viable substitute for both human breast milk and conventional formula milk, which frequently faces criticism for being an inadequate alternative.
they anticipate that dairy products derived from these genetically modified cow herds could eventually be available for purchase in supermarkets.
backed by a prominent biotechnology company, this research is expected to ignite further controversy surrounding genetically modified foods.
opponents of gm technology and animal welfare organizations have voiced concerns about the safety of milk produced by genetically modified animals and its potential impact on the health of the cattle involved.
in response to sanctions related to moscow's annexation of crimea, more than a dozen canadian officials have been banned from ever entering russia.
the targeted individuals include aides to canadian pm stephen harper and members of parliament.
russia's foreign ministry justified its actions as a response to what it deemed as "unacceptable action" by canada that significantly harmed bilateral relations.
pm harper, who visited ukraine recently, condemned russia's actions and called for the complete reversal of crimea's annexation, as well as advocated for russia's expulsion from the group of eight nations.
among the canadian officials on the russian blacklist are andrew scheer, the house of commons speaker, peter van loan, the government leader in the house, and various other lawmakers.
the annexation of crimea by moscow, following a disputed referendum, has been deemed illegal by ukraine and western countries.
the us and eu have also imposed sanctions on individuals, including high-ranking officials, implicated in the annexation of crimea.
in a segment under review for next tuesday’s budget, the proposal entails allowing first-time home purchasers to access funds from their superannuation for a deposit, provided they replenish the amount later.
additionally, a strategy being considered is for individuals to accelerate their savings for deposits by having their salaries directed into accounts similar to superannuation.
this forthcoming budget, to be delivered by scott morrison and malcolm turnbull, is expected to project a surplus for 2020-21 utilizing a novel parameter known as the "net operating balance," which will exclude additional expenditures on infrastructure projects.
nevertheless, prominent budget prognosticators such as deloitte access economics, led by former budget official chris richardson, have expressed skepticism about this projection.
the organization, often referred to as the "treasury in exile," casts doubt on the likelihood of returning to surplus in the foreseeable future, citing assumptions that hinge on sustained cuts in grants to states and the senate's approval of budget reductions it has not exhibited interest in supporting.
richardson anticipates that the budget will not swiftly transition back to a surplus state, as he conveyed in advance of the upcoming release of the deloitte access budget monitor on monday.
professional photographer shane spencer was driving home to eagle river on the glenn highway one rainy monday morning after a photo shoot.
he recalled how a brown bear suddenly appeared in front of his car as he had his equipment prepared.
spencer described the bear as displaying great excitement as it emerged from the woods on the eagle river side of the hiland road exit, east of the northbound lanes.
the bear then hesitated briefly on the highway's shoulder before ultimately crossing, causing several vehicles to come to a halt.
spencer estimated that about six drivers stopped to watch the bear, with many other passengers in passing vehicles likely catching a glimpse of the unusual sight.
he also noted that traffic in the southbound lanes stopped as well while the bear briefly lingered in the median before continuing its journey across the highway.
melbourne's tram network is about to undergo significant changes, as three routes are to be redirected to new destinations, one route will see a reduction in services, and another will be eliminated altogether.
initially planned for april alongside the opening of the regional rail link, the tram network overhaul has been postponed to june for further assessment by the andrews government, the first under their administration.
according to a fairfax media leak, the restructuring targets some of the most overcrowded tram lines in melbourne, including the permanently discontinued route 8 between moreland and toorak, a heavily burdened corridor that consistently experiences overcapacity during peak hours, exceeding 100% occupancy levels throughout the morning and evening rush periods.
the serie a match between ac milan and roma faced a halt on sunday due to racist chanting heard within the san siro stadium.
play was paused for approximately two minutes at the start of the second half after racist chants were directed at milan's black players by the visiting supporters.
roma's captain, francesco totti, raised concerns to the referee regarding the chants and later approached the fans to address the issue.
an announcement instructed the cessation of the racist chants before the game resumed, which ultimately ended in a goalless draw.
former manchester city striker mario balotelli and kevin-prince boateng were part of the milan team affected by the incident.
notably, a friendly match between milan and pro patria was previously suspended in january due to racist chants directed at boateng.
in response to such events, the italian football federation implemented new regulations empowering referees to address racist behavior, including the authority to stop matches and order stadium-wide announcements.
in cases where these measures prove ineffective, match and stadium officials have the right to abandon the game.
additionally, in march, fifa established a taskforce dedicated to combating discrimination in football, which includes boateng, english referee howard webb, and football association chief executive david bernstein among its members.
during a house education committee hearing on thursday, state representative carolyn halstead, a milford republican, received a stern rebuke from house speaker shawn jasper for inadvertently dropping her loaded handgun as she entered the room.
halstead promptly apologized for the incident, clarifying that her gun fell to the floor without firing as it became dislodged from her waistband while she was removing her backpack.
the occurrence took place amidst a full room gathered for a public hearing on a bill concerning increased funding for full-day kindergarten programs.
although there were children present, most attendees seemed unaware of the incident.
halstead mentioned that she holds a concealed carry license and had the gun's safety lock engaged.
speaker jasper addressed the incident with halstead, deeming her lack of control over her firearm as unacceptable.
it is noted that individuals, including lawmakers and the public, are permitted to carry guns within the confines of the statehouse and legislative offices.
according to horns247, texas coach charlie strong has informed two assistant coaches that they will not be retained for the 2015 season.
bruce chambers, the sole remaining staff member from the mack brown era, was informed that his coaching tenure with the longhorns has come to an end.
chambers joined texas in december 1997 as part of brown's original coaching staff and was responsible for coaching tight ends.
les koenning, the team's wide receivers coach, was also released from his position.
koenning, a former texas player and all-swc receiver, had joined the longhorns last season after serving as the offensive coordinator for mississippi state.
the search for their replacements has led to the consideration of potential candidates such as derek lewis, a former texas tight end now coaching at florida, and jay boulware, the oklahoma tight ends and special teams coach who previously played offensive tackle for texas under john mackovic.
as for the receivers coach role, ron dugans emerges as a candidate to watch, having played at florida state and worked with strong and offensive coordinator shawn watson at louisville.
dugans most recently coached receivers at south florida in 2014.
police in east nashville reported that a teenager who was shot overnight may have provided misleading information about the incident.
the victim, an 18-year-old, was found with a gunshot wound to his leg on south 4th street prior to midnight.
he was promptly transported to vanderbilt university medical center for treatment and is anticipated to make a full recovery.
despite the victim's initial claim of being an innocent bystander unaware of the shooter's identity, detectives indicated discrepancies between his story and the available evidence.
as of now, no charges have been pressed in connection with this incident, which marked the third shooting in the area that weekend.
in a related case just blocks away on saturday morning, two individuals were shot in what authorities suspected to be drug-related, yet received conflicting details during the investigation.
two tugs have been dispatched to stabilize the shen neng 1, which ran aground on douglas shoal, situated 43 miles east of great keppel island off the coast of queensland, on a saturday.
authorities caution that the process of removing the vessel may take weeks and that it poses a significant risk of potentially spilling hundreds of tonnes of oil onto the reef during the delicate operation.
the leakage of oil from the coal carrier has already resulted in a slick spanning two miles on the ocean's surface, although the rate of oil leakage has decreased.
concerns persist, however, about the possibility of the ship breaking up in the three-meter swell, with the vessel's constant shifting in strong winds causing substantial damage to the reef beneath it.
queensland premier anna bligh has stated that the expenses associated with salvaging the ship and cleaning up the spill will be billed to its owners, cosco group.
the shen neng 1, carrying 975 tonnes of heavy fuel oil and 65,000 tonnes of coal, had veered more than 15 miles off its designated shipping lane and was traveling at full speed when it collided with the reef.
initial assessments indicate damage to the main engine room, the main engine, and the rudder, with the vessel still in motion on the reef due to the sea's action causing further harm.
aircraft have been deployed to disperse substances over the two-tonne oil slick, contained in two patches.
despite these efforts, a visible stretch of damaged coral extending for miles from the ship has been observed.
conservationists are urging for stricter regulations on the numerous ships passing near the reef annually.
douglas shoal, where the incident occurred, is a restricted area for commercial vessels as it falls within the great barrier reef marine park.
the shen neng 1's presence in the forbidden zone will be investigated by the australian transport safety bureau.
the move towards a vote on legalizing same-sex marriage in nsw has advanced as mps from various political parties have officially introduced new legislation.
a bipartisan group of mps from the coalition, labor, the greens, and an independent have collaborated on a bill that seeks to permit marriage for gay and lesbian couples within the state, following the unsuccessful attempts of three federal same-sex marriage bills earlier in the year.
premier barry o'farrell has confirmed that liberal mps will have a conscience vote on the bill in the upcoming parliamentary session, while deputy premier andrew stoner has assured the same for the nationals.
labor mps will also have the freedom of a conscience vote.
notice of the bill's introduction will be made by multiple mps in the upper house on tuesday.
greens mlc cate faehrmann highlighted the cooperative effort in nsw, contrasting it with what was perceived as reluctance by tony abbott and julia gillard towards marriage equality.
with the upcoming expansion in mind, i wanted to create a desert-themed ensemble.
drawing inspiration from the desert borderlands where i enjoy roaming, i crafted a look that captures the essence of that environment.
opting for colors reminiscent of desert landscapes such as light browns, warm oranges, and hints of lavender, i aimed to blend seamlessly into the surroundings while maintaining a stylish appearance.
the outfit is designed to exude an explorer vibe, complete with practical gear specific to desert conditions like a mercenary backpack, goggles, and a protective scarf to shield against the dusty winds.
additional elements such as gloves, a top, and boots were chosen to embody the rugged wilderness of the region.
to complement the overall theme, the weapons chosen have a desert wilderness aesthetic; resembling a dead branch for the staff and taking inspiration from the skeletons of beasts for the greatsword and longbow.
while the specific items - longbow: mordrem longbow, greatsword: beastslayer greatsword, staff: yggdrasil, backpack: mercenary backpack - may not be available, i hope you appreciate the desert-infused theme i've put together.
as the 2017 league year is fast approaching, the 30 teams not involved in sunday's significant game are eagerly anticipating the opportunity to begin their offseason operations.
according to a report by jason la canfora of cbs, several teams, particularly those in need of a quarterback, have engaged in extensive internal discussions regarding the potential acquisition costs of sought-after trade targets tony romo, kirk cousins, and hometown hero jimmy garoppolo.
sources within the bears organization shared with la canfora that there is strong interest from chicago in pursuing garoppolo aggressively.
many league executives view garoppolo as the premier quarterback target for the upcoming offseason.
bears fans who have long speculated about potential trade scenarios involving garoppolo will not be surprised by this development.
given the positive trade history between chicago and new england, the bears' significant draft assets, and their impending need for a quarterback post-jay cutler, the potential match seems ideal.
additionally, the bears' general manager, ryan pace, and garoppolo both hail from eastern illinois, furthering the connection.
la canfora also mentioned that the bears have extensively assessed kirk cousins from washington, although it is widely anticipated in the football community that cousins will receive the franchise tag for a second consecutive season.
in the southern german state of bavaria, a tragic incident unfolded in a courtroom where a state prosecutor lost his life after being shot by a 54-year-old defendant during a case at dachau district court.
initial reports indicate that the gunman targeted the judge before turning the gun on the prosecutor, striking him three times in the arm, stomach, and shoulder.
despite being rushed to the hospital, the prosecutor succumbed to his injuries.
the defendant was quickly subdued and apprehended by authorities.
allegedly accused of illicit wage payments, the defendant was reported to have neglected substantial national insurance contributions.
the victim, a 31-year-old from munich with just a year of tenure at the bavarian prosecutor's office, was said to have faced potential charges resulting in a fine or up to five years of imprisonment if found guilty.
following prior assaults on legal officials, security measures at german courts had been bolstered in recent years, although it was noted that strict searches had not been conducted on the defendant in this case.
this tragic occurrence adds to a series of violent events in courtrooms across germany, including a previous incident in landshut in april 2009 and another in dresden a few months later.
a belgian murderer and rapist serving a life sentence is set to have his life ended by doctors following a landmark decision based on belgium's euthanasia laws.
frank van den bleeken, who argued that he saw no possibility of release due to his persistent violent sexual urges, wishes to exercise his right to medically assisted suicide to put an end to years of mental torment.
an innovative move in assisted suicide, belgium has taken a significant step in granting this request.
according to his lawyer, jos vander velpen, multiple doctors and psychologists have evaluated van den bleeken over the years and unanimously agree that his suffering is unbearable.
this judicial ruling, which marks the first instance involving a prisoner since the introduction of the euthanasia law 12 years ago, signifies a new chapter in belgium's approach to assisted suicide.
despite receiving advice from its own department warning that disincentives like temporary protection visas and offshore processing alone would not deter asylum boat arrivals, the government proceeded with that aspect of the plan nonetheless.
as anticipated, the arrival of boats did not cease or diminish, leading to the conclusion that labor's policy was ineffective.
this leaves the government facing a dilemma as it heads into an election year, where it is criticized for the perceived cruelty and inhumane conditions on nauru, while also being chastised by the coalition for the continuing influx of boat arrivals.
coalition spokesperson scott morrison has pointed out that more asylum seekers have arrived by boat since labor assumed power in 2007 than the entire population of alice springs, using this vivid comparison to underscore the ongoing issue.
labor is now resorting to measures reminiscent of the howard era, such as issuing bridging visas to refugees processed onshore, which could leave them in a state of prolonged legal uncertainty and destitution for up to five years or even longer, mirroring the predicament faced by those granted temporary protection visas under the howard government.
a new report from the uk drug policy commission is set to reveal that enforcement officers, such as police and customs, have acknowledged the challenging task of eradicating the uk drugs market.
the study notes that traditional enforcement methods like arrests and drug seizures have little to no long-term effect on reducing the drug supply.
in some instances, these actions have even worsened the situation by triggering turf wars or causing drug markets to relocate to more sensitive locations like near schools or residential areas.
the report suggests a shift towards a new strategy that focuses on addressing the specific harms created by drug markets in each community, whether it's increased violence or heightened fear of crime.
the commission, an independent think-tank, supports a policy that may involve relocating drug markets to minimize negative impacts rather than shutting them down entirely.
tough decisions will have to be made, such as weighing the reduction of certain harms against the potential rise of others, like moving a drug market from one area to another.
the report, titled "refocusing drug related law enforcement to address harms," also proposes providing support for the families of arrested drug dealers as another way to mitigate harms.
a survey of 400 enforcement officers conducted for the study revealed that 90% believe eradicating the uk drug market in the near future is highly unlikely.
the report highlights that drug markets are vast, adaptable, and quick to fill any gaps, rendering traditional enforcement methods ineffective.
it stresses that arrests and seizures have minimal enduring impact on the harm inflicted on communities.
different areas may experience varying degrees of collateral damage from drug markets, thus enforcement efforts should prioritize addressing the most harmful impacts specific to each locale.
the report underscores the importance of evaluating all enforcement operations to ensure they have delivered positive outcomes for communities.
anticipation is building for the upcoming premier league season, with changes on the horizon.
sky sports news hq has learned that premier league clubs will be considering increasing the number of substitutes allowed on match days from seven to nine in an upcoming discussion.
while clubs will still only be able to make three substitutions, there is a push, led by manchester united and chelsea, to expand the bench by adding two extra players.
back in 2008, the premier league raised the substitution limit from five to seven.
the proposal to further increase it will be on the agenda for the premier league's upcoming agm in june.
this meeting will mark the return of burnley, middlesbrough, and either hull or sheffield wednesday to the shareholders' fold.
among the new features for the season are live and exclusive friday night matches on sky sports, with a total of 10 games scheduled throughout the season.
additionally, there will be a new substitute board sponsored by tag heuer, a new 2016-2017 premier league ball by nike launching in the summer, and an updated premier league logo that will now feature on players' sleeves without the barclays branding following the end of the title sponsorship deal.

the kansas city chiefs clinched a remarkable 42-27 victory on thursday but faced a setback as one of their key offensive players, tyreek hill, had to exit the game late in the fourth quarter due to cramps.
despite his absence, hill's impactful performance prior to his injury cannot be ignored.
the breakaway threat had a standout game, accumulating 133 receiving yards and making a 75-yard touchdown catch.
notably, hill set a league record with this game-breaking score, marking his fifth consecutive regular-season game with a touchdown of 65 yards or more from last season.
throughout the game, hill showcased his versatility by lining up in various positions, demonstrating his speed and effectiveness as a pivotal player in the chiefs' offense.
alongside teammates kareem hunt and travis kelce, who also made significant contributions, hill is an indispensable weapon in kansas city's offensive lineup when in optimal health.

muller, who also serves on the lower house foreign affairs committee, reported the situation to the police.
the woman was questioned by baden police, and muller remains suspended pending further investigation, with the presumption of innocence until the matter is clarified.
barcelona, despite maintaining a flawless 100% record with three consecutive wins in la liga, has expressed dissatisfaction with the refereeing decisions in the league.
the team has raised concerns over multiple denied penalty appeals in various games.
the discontent follows the recent controversy surrounding gerard pique's red card in the spanish super cup clash against athletic.
below are the instances that barcelona is displeased about in the current league season: in the first game against athletic club with referee del cerro grande, a potential handball by gorka elustondo on a sergi roberto cross in the box was overlooked.
the second game versus malaga saw referee santiago jaime latre fail to award a penalty for a handball by miguel torres on neymar and a foul on luis suarez inside the box by angeleri.
in the third game against atletico madrid officiated by referee antonio mateu lahoz, barcelona felt aggrieved as jose gimenez and diego godin were deemed to have handled the ball in the penalty area on separate occasions.
pj harvey's album "dry" was characterized by a shockingly frank subject matter and sound, featuring post-feminist manifestos delivered with a punkish force.
transitioning to her second album, "rid of me," harvey and her trio embarked on a journey to push their artistic boundaries to the extreme.
this bold approach was partly influenced by producer steve albini, who added a bloodless, abrasive edge to the album through his meticulous production style.
while albini's production stripped away subtleties, conveying a stark and uncompromising intensity, harvey’s songwriting showcased shades of grey and uncertainties, making them markedly more personal compared to her earlier work on "dry." despite the sonic clash between harvey's nuanced compositions and albini's polarizing production, the album's lyrical and melodic superiority shines through.
although "rid of me" may be challenging to embrace due to its extreme sound, those who delve into its depths will discover a work of exceptional power and purpose, enriched with raw emotional honesty that sets it apart in its unflinching portrayal of turmoil and vulnerability.
in classic mode on the nintendo 3ds, players can opt for different routes on a map and engage in battles against cpu opponents.
various match types are available, such as one-on-one duels, team skirmishes where cpus can either aid or attack you, battles where you take on opponents individually or in groups, and more.
victories in these matches earn players rewards like trophies, gold, and custom parts.
player balance can be adjusted by spending gold to modify the intensity level before embarking on a game, with higher intensity bringing stronger opponents and greater rewards upon winning.
the stadium features three sub-modes: multi-man smash, home-run contest, and the new addition, target blast.
in target blast, players must strategically use a bomb that detonates after 10 seconds to destroy targets and blocks, accumulating points by aiming the bomb accurately, timing detonations precisely, and utilizing explosive blocks strategically.
president trump is set to go to the treasury department on friday to sign an executive order and two memoranda pertaining to financial matters.
according to a white house spokesperson speaking to the washington examiner, the executive order will task the treasury with reducing burdens imposed by tax regulations issued in 2016, whereas the remaining directives will delve into evaluating two specific provisions of the 2010 dodd-frank financial reform law.
the first aspect under scrutiny is the protocol for government intervention and resolution of troubled banks to prevent a disorderly collapse, which some conservatives criticize as resembling an automatic bailout.
the second area of focus is on the financial stability oversight council, a regulatory body responsible for identifying potential threats to the financial system and designating certain nonbank firms for stringent regulation akin to large banks.
critics among conservatives argue that the council lacks accountability.
notably, the treasury is already acting on a prior executive order that mandates the preparation of a report by secretary steven mnuchin forecasting ways to alleviate regulatory burdens, with the secretary scheduled to deliver the report in june containing recommendations for regulatory and legislative adjustments.
factors that increase the likelihood of fires in buildings in new york city include the neighborhood's average income, the building's age, and any existing electrical issues.
recently, the city's fire department has compiled a database of 60 such factors to rank buildings based on their fire risk.
this ranking system determines the priority for building inspections, aligning with the growing trend of utilizing big data for enhancing city services' efficiency.
similar to new york, boston also employs a data-driven approach to decide which properties require police attention.
previously, new york's firefighters primarily focused on inspecting high-priority buildings like schools and libraries, with other inspections being somewhat random.
the new system implemented by the fire department aims to decrease the occurrence of fires and mitigate their severity.
authorities in tokyo are currently investigating the case of a woman, chisako kakehi, who has been taken into custody under suspicion of causing the death of her husband using cyanide.
this development comes after six men who were associated with her over the past two decades have died under mysterious circumstances.
police are exploring the possibility of financial motives such as insurance claims and inheritances driving these incidents.
these suspicions arose after cyanide was discovered in the body of her 75-year-old husband, who passed away just one month into their marriage in december.
further scrutiny revealed traces of cyanide in the blood of a 71-year-old partner who died in 2012, initially believed to have succumbed to a heart ailment.
kakehi has refuted any involvement in these deaths and remains uncharged as investigations are ongoing.
recent police raids at her residences in osaka and muko city yielded potential evidence like pill capsules and wafers used for handling powdered medication.
the authorities began investigating kakehi after she alerted emergency services about her husband's collapse, leading to the discovery of cyanide in his system and eventually her arrest pending further questioning and decision on pressing charges.
according to research, horses in australia have caused more fatalities in recent years than all venomous animals combined.
ronelle welton from the university of melbourne analyzed data from hospital admissions and coronial records between 2000 and 2013.
during this period, horses were responsible for 74 deaths, surpassing bees and other stinging insects which caused 27 fatalities, and snakes which also claimed 27 lives but led to fewer hospitalizations.
interestingly, spiders did not cause any deaths during this timeframe.
welton's study, published in the internal medicine journal, challenges stereotypes regarding australia's venomous creatures.
while the focus was on animals that bite and sting, the research revealed the significant number of deaths related to horse incidents.
welton highlighted the unexpected finding that insects were the leading cause of hospital admissions, overturning common perceptions about australia's venomous wildlife.
the study emphasized that allergic reactions to bites or stings posed the most substantial risk.
according to better homes, a studio apartment in the renowned burj khalifa, the world's tallest building, can now be rented for as little as dh80,000 per year.
this marks a significant 40 percent decrease in rental prices compared to when the building initially opened ten months ago.
laura adams, the sales and leasing manager at better homes, revealed that one-bedroom units are available for dh100,000 annually.
emaar properties, the developer of burj khalifa, recently released a number of units, leading to an increase in apartment availability and subsequently impacting rental rates.
presently, only eight percent of the 900 apartments in the building are occupied.
the surrounding area has witnessed a decline in property rates due to dubai's property downturn, with some buildings offering amenities comparable to those of burj khalifa but at significantly lower prices.
the address, another property owned by emaar, charges comparable rates but boasts fully serviced apartments with seven on-site restaurants and balconies offering stunning burj khalifa views.
service charges at burj khalifa stand at dh53 per square foot, higher than neighboring residential buildings.
for a standard one-bedroom unit, this amounts to over dh5,000 per month.
during the property boom that coincided with burj khalifa's construction, apartments were being sold for more than dh10,000 per square foot at the peak market rate.
currently, most available units are priced at around dh3,000 per square foot, as per ms.
pirelli has decided to provide formula 1 teams with an additional set of tyres for practice sessions at the upcoming spanish grand prix.
the objective is to encourage top drivers to stay on the track for the entire session, rather than waiting for track conditions to improve.
initially designed for rookie drivers to gain experience, the plan has now been revised to include all drivers.
pirelli specified that the extra tyres would consist of a "prototype hard compound." this arrangement is currently exclusive to the spanish grand prix, with pirelli evaluating its impact on track time before extending it for the rest of the season.
notably, pirelli has made a minor adjustment to the standard 'hard' compound tyre for the spanish grand prix, enhancing durability and reducing operating temperatures.
despite requests from red bull racing to increase tyre durability, pirelli has declined, citing concerns that drivers were refraining from pushing their cars to the limit due to tire wear issues.
during a routine training exercise, a group of swiss soldiers inadvertently crossed the border into liechtenstein at night.
the 170 infantry troops ventured just over a mile into the neighboring principality before realizing their error and retracing their steps, as reported by swiss daily blick.
swiss army spokesman daniel reist acknowledged the incident but assured that there would likely be no significant consequences for the mistaken intrusion following discussions with liechtenstein authorities.
liechtenstein officials, including interior ministry spokesman markus amman, downplayed the situation, noting that the soldiers had gone unnoticed and posed no threat, as they were unarmed despite carrying assault rifles.
notably, liechtenstein, with a population of around 34,000 and a size comparable to washington dc, does not maintain a standing army.
the kurdistan regional government in iraq offered on wednesday to halt the outcomes of an independence referendum and initiate discussions with the central government in baghdad to de-escalate tensions and prevent further conflict between the two entities.
following the seizure of kirkuk and other contested territories by iraqi forces as a response to the controversial referendum deemed unlawful by prime minister haider al-abadi's administration, the krg underscored in its statement that the recent clashes have negatively impacted both sides and pose a significant risk of continued violence and social instability in iraq.
emphasizing that ongoing hostilities will not bring about a conclusive victory for either party, but rather threaten the country with disorder and turmoil across all spheres of life, the krg stressed the urgent need for a cessation of all military operations in the northern region of iraq in addition to the proposal of shelving the referendum results and engaging in dialogue with baghdad.
in parbhani town, located in the drought-affected marathwada region of the state, authorities have announced the enforcement of prohibitory orders near water supply spots due to the severe water scarcity being faced this summer.
parbhani district collector rahul mahiwal informed that orders under section 144 of crpc have been implemented around water supply areas in the town starting from april 4 until may 3.
this decision follows a similar move in latur town, where the police are prepared to deploy officers at water supply locations if required.
latur superintendent of police dnyaneshwar chavan reported that home guards are already stationed at water tanks, with the possibility of police presence to maintain law and order related to water supply concerns.
furthermore, in response to the critical water shortage, latur's district collector, pandurang pol, had previously enforced section 144 of crpc last month to restrict gatherings of more than five people near wells and water filling points in order to prevent potential conflicts.
streaming media company stan is pursuing legal measures against a group of individuals who racially harassed labor senator sam dastyari.
the perpetrators, identified as members of the far-right group patriot blue, allegedly derived their name from stan's upcoming drama series romper stomper.
the incident involved the group surrounding the senator at a melbourne pub, where they demanded he return to his birthplace in iran, accompanied by derogatory racial slurs captured on video and subsequently shared on facebook.
in response, stan and roadshow productions released a statement denouncing the offenders' behavior and engaged the legal services of gilbert and tobin to address the unauthorized use of the patriot blue trademark and the association with stan on social media.
the statement clarified the fictional nature of the patriot blue group in the romper stomper series, emphasizing the absence of any ties between the production team and the individuals involved in the confrontation with senator dastyari.
the lego set i recently built, the disney cinderella castle, was truly an amazing experience from start to finish.
from the intricate details in every corner to the thought put into each section of the set, it was a masterpiece.
initially, when i saw the set available for vip members in august, i hesitated due to the cost.
however, after it sold out quickly in august and during its official release in september, i decided to purchase one.
the build took me approximately 12-13 hours spread over a few days.
upon completion, i was in awe of the time and effort dedicated to creating this exceptional piece of art.
the castle features elements from various disney films, and lego did a remarkable job incorporating intricate details into every part.
taking it a step further, i added colorful lights to both the exterior, replicating the look of disney world, and the interior, without the need for glue or drilling.
while this set is more for display rather than play once built, it is definitely a worthwhile addition for any lego enthusiast.
in a recent development, the afl has been discreetly working on a modified version of australian rules football to be played on a soccer field.
referred to as afl x, this experimental format was tested in a private match between two vfl teams last weekend.
the innovative game format features only seven players per team on the field, a significant reduction from the traditional 18-a-side format.
this initiative is part of the afl's strategic plan to establish itself as a year-round sporting option.
afl ceo gillon mclachlan revealed that the concept stemmed from a collaborative brainstorming session with his team, aiming to appeal to a wider audience beyond existing football fans.
the primary objective of afl x is to make the sport accessible in venues where traditional football fields are not feasible, thus expanding the game's reach.
argentina has criticized the duke of cambridge's deployment to the falkland islands as a "provocative act," while britain maintains that prince william's presence for helicopter rescue pilot training is routine.
sebastian brugo marco, an argentine official responsible for the south atlantic territory, expressed concerns over the political implications of the mission, particularly with the upcoming 30th anniversary of the falklands war.
argentina, which refers to the islands as las malvinas, asserts sovereignty despite british control for over 180 years.
the deployment has been viewed as a show of military presence in a region of peace by mr.
brugo marco, who spoke out against what he deemed another provocative move by britain.
the royal air force clarified that prince william's duties will not include ceremonial activities and is solely focused on his training.
the ongoing tensions have escalated since argentina's intensified campaign for sovereignty in 2010 as britain began offshore drilling in falklands waters, prompting a condemnation from argentine president cristina fernandez de kirchner towards britain's refusal to negotiate.
the disputed status of the islands remains a contentious issue with differing historical claims from both countries.
authorities in nanticoke are currently looking into disturbing incidents involving a masked individual wielding a bow and arrow, which has left residents on edge as halloween approaches.
the police have received reports of two separate attacks, prompting concerns that additional assaults may occur.

in an effort to apprehend the suspect, police are contemplating dna testing on one of the arrows used in the assaults.
a report highlights a significant disparity between mental health services and the crucial requirements of individuals in northern ireland.

according to the washington post, lawyers representing jared kushner, senior advisor to president donald trump, have reached out to at least two crisis public relations firms over the last two weeks.
this action comes amidst heightened media scrutiny surrounding kushner due to ongoing investigations into the alleged ties between the president and russia by congressional and federal authorities.
kushner's attorney, abbe lowell, disclosed that the purpose of engaging a crisis management firm is to handle the extensive press coverage his high-profile client is attracting.
reports indicate that kushner is a focus of special counsel robert mueller's russia investigation, although the counsel's office refrains from commenting on ongoing investigations beyond formal court filings.

lowell declined cnbc's request for comment.

tom brady, along with his new new england patriots teammate danny amendola, was seen working out at usc before returning to the field at the trojans' facility.
during this session, brady surprised many by throwing passes to terrell owens, who had not played in the nfl since the 2010 season.
owens later mentioned the workout on his twitter, indicating that matt cassel, the former patriots quarterback now with the minnesota vikings, was also involved.
despite his brief stint with the seattle seahawks in august last year, owens has an impressive track record, especially from his time with the cincinnati bengals in 2010, where he recorded 72 catches for 983 yards and nine touchdowns in just 14 games.
owens remains one of the top nfl players in terms of all-time receiving yards and touchdowns.
the administrative court in the german city of gelsenkirchen recently ruled that having breast implants does not disqualify a woman from becoming a police officer.

expert testimony presented in court indicated that the likelihood of implant rupture or complications was less than 20 percent, as reported by the dpa news agency.
while national police guidelines discourage women with implants from pursuing police duties due to potential injury risks, previous court cases, such as one in berlin in 2014, have also upheld the right of individuals with breast implants to join the police force, rejecting concerns that protective gear could cause health problems.

following her first high-level interaction with president donald trump's administration, australian foreign minister julie bishop has refrained from expressing confidence in the refugee swap agreement with the united states that was brokered under the obama administration back in november.
the deal was intended to resettle 1800 refugees from australian offshore detention centers in the us.

recent documents disclosed canadian citizens' strong appeal to prime minister justin trudeau for the organization of a referendum on electoral reform.
in nearly 200 pages of correspondence to the prime minister, a number of unwavering liberal backers went to the extent of indicating their readiness to reassess their loyalty due to the manner in which the electoral reform issue has been managed.
the messages, which were acquired by the canadian press through the access to information act, date back to may, a period when the government initially granted liberals a majority on the commons electoral reform panel, a decision that they later revoked following a public uproar.
the majority of correspondents express a preference for proportional representation to replace the prevailing first-past-the-post system, with only a small number opposing the idea of a referendum.
furthermore, numerous individuals urged trudeau to consider the recommendations of the electoral reform committee when it presented its final report, which was released on thursday.
critically, democratic institutions minister maryam monsef criticized the report, which urged the government to develop a new proportional voting system and arrange a referendum to gauge public backing for the proposal.

niantic officials have teasingly suggested that the inclusion of legendary pokemon in pokemon go was inevitable.

the revelation was disclosed in an email sent by a senior us official to key government committees.
this release, believed to have originated from alleged leaks by us soldier bradley manning, who has been charged with the act, would mark the largest data release by wikileaks.
although the announcement of this imminent release was made earlier in the week, the specifics of the material were unknown.
informing the us senate and house committees on armed services, assistant defense secretary elizabeth king cautioned about the potential risks associated with the leak.
in a significant move against early and rigid assessment practices, ontario has announced the elimination of the fall report card, opting for a more progressive evaluation approach for students.
the province plans to introduce alternative methods to assess student progress, replacing the traditional letter or number-based grading system.
this initiative, driven by feedback from educators and teachers' unions, aims to provide more meaningful and insightful assessments for students.
the decision to replace the initial report card with a less formal progress report is just one part of a broader strategy set to be formally introduced next month.
while the changes will prioritize learning skills over grades, concerns have been raised about the need to keep parents informed throughout this transition period.
an advocate for educational reform, such as annie kidder from people for education, underscores the importance of maintaining parent involvement despite the shift away from the fall report card.
tim geithner's banking plan, as structured by the obama administration, risks sparking a potential future scandal akin to the aig bonuses controversy.
concerns have been raised, with dean baker expressing apprehension that unscrupulous individuals could exploit government-provided leverage or that banks might engage in underhanded dealings where insiders profit by selling assets at inflated prices, leaving the government at a loss.
criticisms are already being anticipated from republican faux populists who, despite their historical opposition to wall street oversight contributing to the crisis, would likely blame obama if such a scenario unfolds.
those apprehensive about the bank plan fear these types of scandals and recognize the need to temper any "i-told-you-so" sentiments to support the administration in averting such crises.
the suggestion is to have a proactive strategy in place to place the banks under receivership and break them up, a move that republicans may talk about but never truly pursue.
embracing such decisive action could help deflect criticisms and distractions during a potentially tumultuous period.

he emphasized that it is crucial for israel to be held accountable for the outcomes of the investigation without evasion or avoidance of repercussions.

additionally, fatah called for the end of the blockade on gaza.
berlin police reported that 123 officers sustained injuries during clashes with leftist demonstrators protesting the redevelopment of a district in the city's east.
on saturday, an estimated 3,500 protesters, some wearing masks and hurling projectiles, staged a march through friedrichshain.
authorities described the protest as the most tumultuous in the last five years, attributing the escalation to heightened tensions following the initiation of eviction procedures against squatters in the region.
friedrichshain has witnessed rapid gentrification in recent times, triggering discontent among activists.
despite commencing peacefully, the demonstration spiraled into violence, leading to the arrest of 86 individuals, as police presence swelled to approximately 1,800 officers.
at the epicenter of the conflict lies a block of apartments at 94 rigaer strasse, where squatters have entrenched themselves, resisting eviction efforts and triggering a constant police surveillance since june, including aerial monitoring.
the protest culminated in clashes, with tear gas deployed, shop windows shattered, and police vehicles vandalized.
amidst the mayhem, residents of housing collectives showed solidarity with the squatters, banging spoons against pots to demonstrate their support for the squatters' anti-gentrification stance.

members of the european parliament have rejected a comprehensive set of telecoms reforms, citing the need for enhanced protection for internet users against disconnection.
in a vote that overwhelmingly favored an amendment proposed by the meps, it was emphasized that the rights of web surfers should not be violated without a judicial ruling.
additionally, this decision is also viewed as a form of opposition to a stringent french legislation, known as the "three strikes" bill, which targets individuals engaging in unauthorized downloading of copyrighted content.
despite a prior agreement reached with eu ministers, the meps' vote in strasbourg on wednesday signals a divergence in opinion.
the proposed telecoms package seeks to establish uniform regulatory measures across the eu and safeguard consumers' rights in the rapidly evolving digital landscape.
key provisions include mandating greater transparency in tariff information and contract terms from service providers.
meanwhile, the contentious french bill, if enacted, would empower internet providers to disconnect users caught infringing on copyright laws after receiving two prior warnings, potentially setting a stringent global precedent in combating online piracy - a move strongly supported by the music industry in response to declining revenues.
after a scottish fa hearing, rangers midfielder ryan jack successfully had his red card against kilmarnock overturned.
the 25-year-old had been initially sent off for violent conduct following an incident with kirk broadfoot during their 1-1 draw at ibrox on 25 october.
rangers contested the decision, leading to the sfa's disciplinary tribunal revising the offense to unsporting behavior.
this marks the second time this season jack has had a red card rescinded, with a previous successful appeal after being sent off against hibernian in august.
referee alan muir had initially cautioned both jack and broadfoot before upgrading jack's punishment to a red card following consultation with the fourth official.
the match at ibrox ended in a draw, which turned out to be pedro caixinha's final game in charge before his dismissal as manager, prompting rangers to commence the process of selecting a replacement.
in a shocking incident on the greek island of santorini, a 31-year-old chef, athanassios arvanitis, is currently in critical condition in the hospital after decapitating his girlfriend and parading her head around a village.
arvanitis was shot five times by police before being arrested, sustaining injuries to his lungs and requiring intensive care.
the violent outbreak is believed to have been triggered by arvanitis' recent dismissal from his job as a chef in a local hotel.
during the pursuit, three women suffered injuries but are now reportedly in stable condition.
this disturbing sequence of events began with arvanitis beheading his girlfriend's dog on their balcony in vourvoulos village, followed by fatally stabbing his girlfriend, a 25-year-old teacher named adamantia karkali, in the armpit.
he proceeded to remove her head and exhibit it in public.
in a dramatic confrontation with law enforcement, arvanitis attempted to decapitate a police officer before being apprehended.
medical professionals at the hospital expressed difficulty in restraining him despite his severe injuries.
the chaos resulted in two female doctors being knocked off their motorbike by arvanitis as he tried to escape in a police vehicle, along with a greek female tourist being hit by a stray bullet.
this brutal event has left residents of santorini shaken, with many remarking that such brutality has not been witnessed since the german occupation during world war ii.
encountering a qr code can sometimes be a slightly cumbersome experience involving tapping your barcode scanner, aiming it at the peculiar blocks, and then watching a link open in your browser, leading you to a website or an app download.
the physical web aims to enhance the connection between phones and their surroundings.
in this scenario, instead of qr codes, the focus is on eddystone bluetooth low-energy beacons.
simply being in proximity to one will trigger a notification on your device.
chrome on ios already supports the physical web, and the web bluetooth api began rolling out to the chrome dev channel for android a few months back, with its integration into the chrome 49 beta underway.
when a new user passes by a beacon for the first time, a notification prompts them to activate the physical web.
subsequently, they will view a collection of nearby urls within a discreet notification that does not disrupt them with vibrations.
after further rounds of testing, this feature is expected to be included in the stable release of chrome once version 49 becomes available on devices.
the argentine international completed his move to city from atletico madrid over the weekend, despite never having played for atletico following a recent transfer from malaga.
the 32-year-old reunited with his former manager manuel pellegrini, who unfortunately discovered that the player would not be available until november due to an injury sustained during training.
while scans revealed that demichelis would not require surgery, his absence will be felt by pellegrini, especially with captain vincent kompany and micah richards still recovering from injuries.
pellegrini could turn to joleon lescott, matija nastasic, javi garcia, or dedryck boyata in demichelis' absence.
according to nfl network's ian rapoport, san diego chargers wide receiver malcom floyd is planning to undergo rehabilitation to continue playing despite a torn labrum in 2015.
the injury occurred in week 9 when he dove for a pass thrown by philip rivers in a game against the chicago bears.
the 34-year-old, in his final nfl season, is determined to retire on his own terms, although the exact timeline for his recovery is uncertain.
with keenan allen already out for the season, the chargers' top wide receiver options now include stevie johnson and dontrelle inman if floyd is unable to play.
from a fantasy standpoint, floyd's return and performance could be compromised due to the injury's impact on his ability to reach above his head.
it is suggested that fantasy owners focus on other players like johnson, antonio gates, and danny woodhead in the chargers' passing game, as floyd may not be a reliable option moving forward.
hermel, an eastern lebanese town recognized as a stronghold of the shia group hezbollah, was reportedly struck by a barrage of rockets that were launched from syria.
reports indicate that the attack resulted in the death of at least one individual and left several others injured.
according to al jazeera's hoda abdel hamid, who was reporting from lebanon, the victim was tragically killed while driving through hermel as approximately 10 rockets rained down on the town.
the rockets, believed to have been fired from across the syrian border, claimed the life of the person as they were traveling in their car.
this recent incident adds to a series of cross-border rocket assaults targeting shia areas in lebanon.
the escalation in attacks on northern lebanon has been linked to the recent capture of the central syrian town of qusayr by syrian troops supported by hezbollah fighters, who are strong allies of syrian president bashar al-assad.
abdel hamid highlighted the heightened tensions, noting that hermel had not experienced an attack of this nature since the fall of qusayr.
the deep-rooted sectarian divide in lebanon, exacerbated by the conflict in syria, has polarized the nation.
while the sunni-led march 14 opposition stands in solidarity with the sunni-led uprising against assad, hezbollah and its supporters align themselves with assad's regime.
during a press briefing on monday preceding the us national team's world cup qualifier against honduras, jurgen klinsmann revealed that an additional unpublicized friendly match was on the agenda for august.
although klinsmann didn't disclose the opponent or venue at the time, fifa's official website has since indicated that the us will face off against bosnia-herzegovina on august 13 in sarajevo.
this confirmation aligns with prior speculation about a potential friendly with bosnia in 2013.
with the national team's jam-packed schedule, including world cup qualifiers, the upcoming gold cup, and additional fall qualifiers, this bosnia friendly will serve as another significant challenge for the team.
the usmnt's next planned friendly is set for july 5 against guatemala in san diego, strategically timed as a preparation match for the gold cup.
according to china's state media, six local officials have faced consequences following an incident where a tourist was mistakenly identified as a petitioner and assaulted outside his beijing hotel.
the xinhua news agency revealed that the victim, a tourist from luoyang in henan province, was lodging near the state bureau of letters and calls, a place where individuals can address complaints against government officials.
intruders forcibly took the tourist and three genuine petitioners from their room, subjected them to a violent attack before transporting the tourist back to his hometown and abandoning him by the roadside.
the report attributed the assault to employees of a beijing security firm hired by the luoyang letters and calls bureau.
typically, local officials prefer to avoid complaints against them in beijing to safeguard their region's reputation.
as a response to the incident, one official was dismissed, another suspended, and four received warnings.
additionally, a senior official issued an apology to the tourist.
according to chinese legislation, citizens have the right to appeal to government authorities regarding grievances or unresolved conflicts.
when dissatisfied with local responses, individuals often escalate their concerns to beijing officials through the petitioning process.

accused perpetrator dzhokhar tsarnaev, connected to the boston marathon bombing, was discovered hiding in a boat post-attack, where he left behind a handwritten note that detailed the motive for the assault.
according to a report by cbs news, the message penned by tsarnaev indicated the bombings were a response to us military actions in muslim nations.
this report, sourced from unnamed individuals, mentioned that tsarnaev inscribed the message with a pen while wounded inside the boat, expressing the sentiment that an affront to one muslim equated to an affront to all.
notably, tsarnaev, 19 years old at the time, referred to his deceased brother and co-suspect, tamerlan tsarnaev, as a "martyr" in the note.
cbs news correspondent and former fbi spokesperson, john miller, highlighted the message's assertion that the boston bombing victims were perceived as "collateral damage" resulting from us involvement in conflicts such as those in iraq and afghanistan.
the tragedy at the marathon's finish line claimed three lives and left 264 individuals injured, with the tsarnaev brothers eventually identified as suspects through surveillance footage in the area.
dzhokhar tsarnaev's arrest in watertown, massachusetts, following an extensive manhunt and subsequent lockdown, led to his detention at a correctional healthcare facility near boston, with potential charges carrying severe consequences including capital punishment pending a conviction.

once again, the city council of calgary has rejected the proposal to permit residents to raise hens in their yards.
the 9-6 vote on monday saw the dismissal of a pilot project suggested by councillors ray jones and gian-carlo carra, with hopes of eventually expanding the initiative citywide.
the councillors originally introduced the plan earlier in the year, citing an increasing demand for sustainable, locally sourced food among calgarians.
however, the idea faced scrutiny from certain council members who expressed a need for further information before greenlighting the project.
backyard chicken coops in calgary have faced challenges gaining approval, with a similar proposition failing to launch back in 2010.
while some canadian cities like victoria and vancouver have embraced backyard chicken programs, others such as toronto and halifax have opted against them.
recently, both edmonton and red deer have approved pilot programs for raising chickens in residential areas.
following a "drunken brawl" at a theatre in lahore, a minister from balochistan has been dismissed.
jaffer george was reportedly detained by the police for causing a disturbance during a play on saturday night.
while mr george refutes the allegations and has been released on bail, video evidence suggests his involvement in the incident, including climbing onto the stage.
as a member of the christian minority, he is allowed to consume alcohol, unlike muslims for whom it is prohibited.
public drinking is against the law in pakistan.
mr jaffer, a minister without portfolio representing religious minorities, was elected to a reserved seat in the balochistan government.
the police arrested him for disrupting the play and consuming alcohol at a theatre in qilla gujjar singh district, lahore.
video footage aired by express tv shows mr george and a companion repeatedly engaging with a female performer onstage, interfering with the performance.
despite mr george's claim of political persecution by the punjab government, he was relieved of his ministerial duties by balochistan chief minister nawab aslam raisani following a report from the punjab government.
australian authorities have implemented enhanced screening procedures for workers at major airports in response to a security crackdown following the thwarting of a terror plot targeting a departing plane from sydney airport in july.
baggage handlers and airport personnel working in restricted zones will now undergo random explosive trace tests while inspections of their personal belongings and vehicles will also be conducted.
these changes address concerns raised by union and intelligence experts regarding the screening of staff, particularly those under casual contracts.
transport minister darren chester emphasized the importance of ensuring that airport workers are authorized, properly identified, and adequately trained before accessing secure airside areas.
with approximately 140,000 workers having access to these zones, senator nick xenophon advocated for even stricter measures akin to the mandatory checks employed in the us, criticizing the current random inspection approach as insufficient.

a hailstorm that hit athens on tuesday brought a glimmer of hope to the firefighters engaged in combatting a fire at dervenohoria, located northwest of the city.
the sprawling blaze, which had been raging uncontrollably since saturday, had devoured an estimated 1,200 acres of pine forest in a rugged mountainous region, with unpredictable winds posing challenges for the firefighting crews and military recruits.
on tuesday, a team comprising 250 firefighters, soldiers, and volunteers worked collectively with six airplanes, four helicopters, water tankers, and earthmoving equipment to protect residential areas.

president trump has been expressing growing frustration towards his team regarding their approach to the russia investigation.
particularly, he has directed much of his disappointment towards his white house counsel, don mcgahn, who has been a dedicated supporter of trump since the early days of his campaign.
according to politco, in a recent oval office meeting on monday, trump criticized mcgahn for not taking more substantial actions to address the investigation.
as a result, the russia case has been shifted to trump's personal lawyer, marc kasowitz, while mcgahn focuses on regular white house responsibilities.
this development underscores trump's readiness to assign blame in the midst of his legal troubles, showcasing a pattern of holding even long-standing allies like mcgahn accountable for any perceived shortcomings.

witnesses informed al jazeera that the detonations occurred in proximity to the mountains where the revolutionary guard base stands.
the red crescent promptly dispatched search and rescue teams to the site, with more than 15 ambulances arriving to provide assistance.

a luxury french yacht named the ponant was seized by pirates off the coast of somalia, with all 30 crew members taken hostage, as confirmed by french officials and the ship's owners.
the incident occurred in the gulf of aden, with no passengers aboard at the time of the attack.
the french government swiftly activated a piracy alert plan, deploying all available resources to the area.
despite the presence of us navy patrols in the region, somali coastal waters remain perilous, as evidenced by the seizure of over 25 ships last year.
the ponant, an 850-tonne three-masted yacht returning from the seychelles to the mediterranean, was targeted by the pirates.
french military spokesman christophe prazuck stated that no shots were fired during the seizure.
the vessel is owned by the shipping group cma cgm, with most of the crew being french nationals.
french prime minister francois fillon condemned the incident as a "blatant act of piracy" and pledged to secure the hostages' release quickly.
french and allied forces in the region were placed on high alert as efforts were made to resolve the situation.
the hijacked yacht, suitable for up to 64 passengers, boasts a luxurious design with four decks, two restaurants, and both indoor and outdoor lounges for a stylish cruising experience.

noida police confirmed reports that sharma, also an rti activist, was captured in bangalore after sightings of him in nepal.
acting on these leads, law enforcement dispatched teams to karnataka and nepal, suspecting that the 38-year-old sharma had orchestrated his own demise.
his wife, savita, disclosed that sharma was allegedly cohabiting with another woman and shared her belief that his death was feigned.
authorities have determined that the charred remains discovered in the car belong to another individual and are now reinvestigating the case.
savita further revealed that the police successfully located sharma by tracing his mobile device.
bubblesoft, known for their popular bubbleupnp app, has recently released an android server counterpart.
previously, users could utilize a bubbleupnp server on various platforms such as windows, mac, linux, raspberry pi, or a nas, and then access or share local media using the player app on android.
now, android devices can also function as servers with a few important considerations in mind.
although the app is available, users need to locate it as it is designed with a minimalistic approach and lacks user-friendly guidance.
additionally, it is not recommended to run the bubbleupnp server on daily driver devices due to its persistent running nature and significant battery consumption.
however, for those with spare devices like fire tv or nexus player, or a device with ample cpu power and consistent access to a power source, this new server app can be a valuable addition.
despite this, bubblesoft cautions against using android hardware as servers unless necessary, which is why the app is not listed on the play store to prevent negative reviews and potential device overheating issues.
those interested in using the server app can obtain the apk file from bubblesoft's official website after understanding and accepting these caveats.

microsoft promised its presence, albeit with limited details apart from hints of a potential used game "activation fee." recent reports from mcv now suggest that retailers privy to a briefing by redmond have shed light on the trade-in procedures.
these unnamed retailers reveal that establishments wanting to engage in resale activities will be required to connect to a microsoft database to facilitate the transfer of game access from the previous owner to a new one.
while retailers will have discretion over pricing, a portion of the proceeds will be directed to the publisher and microsoft.
the reported process seems plausible, yet the actual intricacies may prove to be more complex.
pat mahaney, shown in a photo courtesy of 19 action news, tragically succumbed to the injuries sustained during a violent assault by a group of bored teenagers in north college hill, oh last august.
the hamilton county prosecutors office confirmed the passing of the 46-year-old on friday morning, less than a year after the brutal attack that led to internal bleeding and a four-day hospitalization.
the cause of death remains uncertain, pending the results of mahaney's autopsy which are expected to be disclosed in the coming weeks.
the incident, where the juveniles, aged 13 and 14, ambushed mahaney from behind, striking him in the head with a recently purchased six-pack of beer, occurred on aug.
north college hill police chief gary foust revealed that the teenagers premeditated the assault and were subsequently taken into custody.
six individuals were arrested and charged with felonious assault and aggravated riot.
three of the teenagers admitted guilt to the felonious assault charges, leading to the withdrawal of the aggravated riot accusations as reported by abc.
if mahaney's autopsy links his demise to the prior assault, the young perpetrators could face further legal ramifications.
this front sight block is specifically designed for the henry h001 rifle to accommodate a suppressed lever action rifle.
its purpose is to bring the mag tube down to allow clearance for the suppressor during loading and to increase the height of the front sight post for compatibility with a skinner peep sight mounted on the receiver's dovetail.
some sanding may be required for proper barrel fitting, and adjustments to the screw's counterbore depth may be necessary based on its length for secure attachment to the barrel.
note that if used without a suppressor, this sight may be too tall when paired with the standard rear sight, and the lowered mag tube should be considered.
files are provided for potential modifications to suit individual preferences.

during the early 20th century, detroit, michigan, emerged as a prominent city due to the rapid growth of the automobile industry and associated manufacturers.
in the 1940s, the city experienced a period of significant development marked by upheaval and transformation.
factories shifted their focus to producing war machines, leading to a transition in roles as women stepped into positions traditionally held by men who were serving overseas during world war ii.
this demand for labor attracted a wave of african-american workers to detroit, facing resistance from white residents who opposed their integration into neighborhoods and workplaces.
the racial tensions culminated in a three-day race riot in 1943, resulting in 34 fatalities and numerous injuries.
following the end of world war ii, the demand for labor decreased, prompting detroit to strategize for the postwar era with a focus on large automobiles and the construction of expansive highways to support the city's automotive industry.
a cbi investigation has been initiated into the substantial wealth amassed by yadav singh, a high-ranking government official in uttar pradesh.

singh's residence in noida last december, authorities discovered a significant amount of wealth, including diamonds valued at rs.
100 crore, two kilograms of gold, cash amounting to crores, and ownership of 20 properties.
additionally, investigators found documentation associating mr.
singh's spouse with 40 fictitious companies.
officials speculate that the source of his riches could be linked to a multi-crore scam.
singh's swift rise from a junior engineer in 1980 to chief engineer within two decades, overseeing the noida, greater noida, and yamuna expressway authorities, has raised suspicions of corruption.
in 2012, he was suspended by the samajwadi party government on corruption charges but was later purportedly reinstated with more authority.

the wii u's main attraction was its utilization of the wii u gamepad as a tablet for game control.
however, launch titles like new super mario bros.
and nintendo land failed to effectively showcase the new and unique gaming experience the console offered, unlike the impactful launch games of its predecessor.
this lack of clarity played a role in hindering the wii u's success and stability over its lifecycle.
reggie fils-aime emphasized the need for improved software planning to address this issue.
it appears this perspective influenced the strategy for the legend of zelda: breath of the wild's development for the nx, intended for a simultaneous release with the console.
with a promising lineup of games on the horizon for the nx, nintendo aims for a more successful run this time.
while the company seems to be making strides in the right direction, only time will reveal if the nx can indeed become a standout hit in the gaming market.

trinidad and tobago's former defender marvin andrews has recently joined montrose, marking his 14th club.
the 39-year-old player signed with links park until the conclusion of the season after departing from elgin city in the scottish league two.
andrews, a veteran with 101 international caps for his national team, had made 14 appearances and scored twice for elgin city before his move, with the team positioned at the bottom of the league table.
montrose, currently sitting eighth, hold a five-point lead over elgin - a team that now has jim weir as manager following barry wilson's resignation in november.
elgin has two games in hand.
andrews, who last played for elgin in early december, debuted for montrose in a 2-2 draw against league leaders arbroath.
his scottish journey began in 1997 with raith rovers before stints at several other clubs, including livingston, rangers, hamilton academical, queen of the south, wrexham, kirkintilloch rob roy, and albion rovers, culminating with a season at forfar athletic in league one.
on another note, montrose has released polish midfielder leszek nowosielski due to commuting challenges from his residence in turriff.
nowosielski, 22, had only made two substitute appearances and encountered delays in obtaining his international clearance, debuting for the squad against east fife in december.

despite the lack of clarity on how and why the baby was involved, an official document broadcasted by cnn affiliate geo news listed charges of stoning and attempted murder.
the family's lawyer, irfan tarar, criticized the police for wrongly implicating the innocent infant.
after the incident gained media attention, punjab chief minister shahbaz sharif instructed the immediate suspension of a pakistani official responsible for the case against the baby.
despite cnn's efforts, contacting the family members was unsuccessful.

alone in an untouched darkness shone the keeper's original sun, a solitary beacon of conscious light destined to radiate warmth into the void.
over countless ages, this brilliant light gathered its immense energy before bursting into a cataclysmic supernova flare.

saudi arabia is expressing displeasure at the fact that a street in seoul bears the name of iran's capital, which is its arch-rival.
saudi arabia is now pushing for a street in seoul to be named after its own capital.
however, considering that iran is a crucial trading partner for korea, officials in seoul are hesitant about the idea of having a riyadh street associated with a regime known for its oppressive practices.
the suggestion to name a street in the mapo district after riyadh was made by saudi arabian oil company aramco to its korean subsidiary s-oil in march.
saudi officials hope that this gesture will strengthen bilateral relations and are open to reciprocating by naming a street in riyadh after seoul.
despite the foreign ministry's assurance that naming the street after riyadh would not lead to diplomatic issues, district officials remain cautious.
the recent visit of president park geun-hye to tehran has raised concerns about delicately managing relations with both countries, given their involvement in various conflicts in the middle east.
saudi billionaire prince al-waleed bin talal is currently in korea for meetings with officials, and it remains uncertain if he will try to influence the seemingly trivial matter.

the impartial judges diligently deliberated on the concerns raised by citizens, ensuring the legality of governmental decisions through a judicious review process.
the proceedings were characterized by civility, with all involved parties having their viewpoints thoughtfully examined, a rarity in many parts of the world.
thus, even amidst a divided public opinion on the matter, the nation can find solace in the meticulous and fair process guiding the resolution of the issue.

walker is anticipated to begin rehabilitation immediately and is projected to be fully recovered for the upcoming spring training.
during the latter part of the season, he struggled with ankle and foot problems, resulting in a disabled list stint.
another pitcher, reliever steve cishek, recently had surgery to fix a torn labrum in his left hip, and his recovery period is estimated at four to six months, raising doubts about his availability for the beginning of spring training.

eight days following the devastating earthquake that struck japan, an elderly woman aged 80 and a teenage boy of 16 years old were discovered alive amidst the ruins of a collapsed house.
referred to as sumi abe and likely her grandson jin abe, they were located beneath the debris by rescue teams in ishinomaki city, within miyagi prefecture, as reported by the afp news agency.
initially together in the kitchen when the earthquake struck on the 11th of march, a doctor shared that their survival was attributed to their access to yogurt and other supplies retrieved from the refrigerator.
the grandson eventually made his way to the roof of the demolished house, where he caught the attention of a rescue helicopter from japan's nhk news service.
both individuals are currently receiving medical attention at a hospital in ishinomaki, where a police spokesperson mentioned that while their body temperatures were notably low, they were conscious.
specific details regarding their condition were pending, although a rescuer noted that the teenage boy was found trembling and experiencing numbness in one of his legs.
miyagi bore the brunt of the twin calamities of the earthquake and ensuing tsunami on that fateful 11th of march, with authorities now expressing concerns over a potential loss of 15,000 lives in that prefecture alone.
a case of misidentification emerged when the military previously reported the discovery of a man amidst the rubble, only for clarifications to reveal that he had been mistakenly identified after attempting to return to his residence from an evacuation center.
prime minister malcolm turnbull staunchly defended the role of coal-powered electricity, labeling critics who believe the resource lacks a future as "delusional." speaking at the liberal national party state convention in brisbane, mr turnbull criticized the state labor government’s plans for queensland to achieve carbon neutrality in its energy supply by 2050, which he deemed as "reckless." stressing australia's interest in the coal industry's sustainability, he argued, "those asserting that coal and other fossil fuels have no prospects are delusional and contradict economic projections." the audience, who had recently endorsed a resolution advocating support for the coal sector, applauded mr turnbull’s remarks.
the russian prison service announced today that they apprehended a cat being utilized as a courier for smuggling prohibited cell phones and chargers into a prison camp located in the remote far north of the country.
according to the komi region's prison service website, the cat was intercepted on friday evening while scaling the fence of the number one corrective labour camp.
the feline had two cell phones, batteries, and chargers affixed to its back with tape.
a visual shared by the prison service depicted a black-and-white cat being held up by a guard by the scruff of its neck, with the contraband still attached to its fur.
the regional prison service stated, "while they have thwarted numerous efforts to smuggle contraband into prison colony number one in the past, the prison is confounded by this occurrence involving the cat, as such an incident is unprecedented in the prison's history." it is evident that companies such as uber and lyft have introduced a highly appealing service, one that taxi companies now regret not having initiated first.
despite the benefits these services offer to customers, they are encountering significant legal challenges.
many lawmakers, including california senator ben hueso, tend to favor the interests of the taxi industry, complicating the future prospects of companies like uber.
interestingly, shortly after backing a taxi lobby bill, senator hueso was apprehended for driving under the influence.
i cannot help but speculate on this turn of events.
after leaving his usual drinking spot, hueso likely found no taxi available and resorted to drunk driving.
with the convenience of uber or lyft, a few taps on the smartphone could have easily secured a ride without the need for verbal communication, even in a state of intoxication.
nevertheless, hueso opted to drive while impaired.
what makes this incident particularly noteworthy is the timing – not only was hueso driving under the influence, he was driving in the wrong direction, indicating severe intoxication.
it is alarming to think that such individuals are involved in legislating new laws, though unfortunately not entirely unexpected.
today, seaworld orlando reported the death of an adult male atlantic bottlenose dolphin.
although the cause of death remains unknown, the 22-year-old dolphin had not displayed any signs of illness prior to the incident.
a necropsy will be conducted and results are expected in six to eight weeks.
fred jacobs, a spokesman for seaworld, expressed the staff's sorrow, noting that the dolphin was a cherished member of the park's group of over 80 bottlenose dolphins in orlando.
seaworld states on its website that most bottlenose dolphins typically have a lifespan of 20 years or less, drawing from census data of the sarasota dolphin population.
however, the national oceanic and atmospheric administration suggests that bottlenose dolphins live between 40 to 50 years.
seaworld further highlights that the sarasota group of dolphins constitutes the world's longest-studied population.
in a separate incident last month, a beluga whale at seaworld passed away due to complications from an infection linked to a jaw injury.
the exact cause of that beluga whale's death is still pending investigation.
thomas broich, a standout in the a-league, recently experienced the disappointment of losing one of the most exceptional goals in his career due to a flawed refereeing decision.
despite the remarkable 25-meter goal being disallowed during a match against adelaide, broich has firmly opposed the implementation of goal-line technology.
even as his coach mike mulvey advocates for additional assistance for referees, broich remains committed to upholding the intrinsic human factor in the sport.
described as a phantom goal, the missed opportunity deeply affected broich, who envisioned framing it as a memento.
recognized as one of the top international players in a-league history, broich expressed his dismay at the denial of the memorable goal he had hoped to cherish.
he emphasized the emotional impact of such incidents but stressed the importance of embracing the fallibility of decisions, including denied goals, as part of the game.
german chancellor angela merkel lauded turkey's significant role in assisting millions of refugees fleeing from syria and iraq during a summit of european conservative leaders in malta.
merkel emphasized the importance of european nations stepping up to share the burden of refugee support, acknowledging the eu's past negligence in fulfilling its humanitarian responsibilities towards individuals escaping conflicts in the middle east.
she noted that turkey, lebanon, and jordan had shouldered the weight of the refugee crisis alone for too long and deserved recognition for their efforts.
merkel highlighted turkey's contributions in hosting three million refugees and stressed the necessity for europe to show solidarity by supporting turkey in this endeavor.
she also highlighted the eu-turkey agreement established in the previous year to curtail illegal migrations across the aegean sea and enhance the welfare of refugees residing in turkey.
despite the successful reduction in refugee inflows due to the agreement, tensions have emerged as the eu faces criticism from turkish authorities for not meeting its commitments, such as delayed funding for refugee projects, reluctance from some eu states towards refugee relocation, stalled talks on turkey's eu accession, and unmet promises of visa liberalization for turkish citizens.
merkel acknowledged the decline in asylum applications in germany from 890,000 in 2015 to 280,000 in 2016 following the implementation of the eu-turkey agreement.
however, recent political strains between turkey and the eu have cast doubt on the sustainability of the agreement, with turkish officials hinting at potential reconsideration of the pact.
i am eager to delve deeper into the game mechanics, animations, and visual effects without encountering spoilers.
i have explored available footage showcasing gameplay and combat, which was a satisfying glimpse into the game.
the content i have come across is reminiscent of what was presented at quakecon and gamescom, steering clear of major spoilers.
releasing the footage that bethesda shared at those events would satiate my curiosity without jeopardizing the storyline for me.
it's unclear whether the leaks are from reviewers bound by a non-disclosure agreement or from regular players who obtained early access through dubious means.
however, my patience will pay off as everything will be openly discussed in a week anyway.
legionaere tv has successfully completed their crowdfunding campaign, achieving their goal of raising 13,428 euros on the penultimate day of the drive.
as a result, they will now be able to offer instant replay during the 2015 season.
their remarkable success was further bolstered by a stellar live stream performance during the european championship first round in regensburg, attracting 5,000 unique daily viewers from across the globe and garnering almost 14,000 euros in total funds.
serving as the exclusive broadcaster for all home games of the buchbinder legionaere regensburg, legionaere tv has also provided coverage for numerous other prestigious events including the european cup, the buchbinder cup, bundesliga all-star games, and the mlb european academies tournaments.
moreover, viewers can access all matches as video on demand, ensuring a comprehensive and accessible viewing experience.
after attempting to install the 3tb drive on my pc, i encountered issues with the system not booting completely and was unable to format the disk.
following guidance from wd support, i ran their data lifeguard diagnostic for windows on the drive, but the pc still would not boot with the hdd installed.
to address this, i acquired a usb docking station which allowed me to format the drive and utilize it.
however, the drive still cannot replace the original hdd in my pc, which i was upgrading from 1tb to the 3tb drive for additional storage capacity.
at present, the 3tb drive remains in the docking station with my files transferred to it.
i am unsure if a replacement drive would function in the pc due to potential issues with the 3tb hdd.
it remains uncertain if d'onta foreman, the running back from texas, will conclude the season as the nation's top rusher, however, what is certain is his decision not to return next season to defend his ranking.
foreman recently declared his intention to forgo his final year of eligibility and enter the nfl draft in the spring.
it is a sensible choice for foreman given his impressive 2,028 rushing yards this season, which currently leads the nation along with 15 touchdowns, making him a potential heisman trophy finalist.
these remarkable statistics have been achieved through carrying the ball 323 times this season, which includes a notable 51 carries in a recent game against kansas.
running backs inevitably endure wear and tear from the physical demands of the position, emphasizing the importance of making an early transition to the nfl to maximize future earning potential.
although the nfl draft is still months away, current projections by cbs sports anticipate foreman as a likely second- or third-round pick.
initially, lca installed a few nanoseptic touch points on doors and counters in their main lobby.
the positive response from staff and parents within the first week prompted them to extend the use of these self-cleaning surfaces to as many areas as possible.
this strategic decision not only aims to maintain a cleaner school environment but also fosters a sense of safety and security among students, teachers, and staff.
the school's effort in implementing these innovative surfaces has also strengthened the bond with parents, showcasing their dedication to providing a hygienic setting for their children.
superintendent john patterson highlighted that the use of nanotechnology-powered self-cleaning surfaces not only enhances cleanliness but also underscores the school's commitment to the well-being of everyone on the premises.
with an enrollment of nearly 2,000 students spanning from pre-k to 12th grade, lca has not only incorporated various nanoseptic products but has also raised awareness among students, parents, and staff by offering educational materials at the main entrance.
the school has equipped primary door touchpoints with nanoseptic skins, utilized durable counter mats at reception desks, and introduced nanoseptic mousepads in the computer lab.
moreover, they are evaluating the potential use of place mats for pre-schoolers and in the cafeteria for future use.
this year has witnessed a significant rise in the abduction of journalists within syria due to the deteriorating conditions of the conflict and the increasing influence of jihadist elements, rendering the country one of the most dangerous conflict zones for media professionals, as reported by news media advocacy groups, human rights activists, and experienced correspondents.
many of these abductions seem to be orchestrated by extremist insurgent groups and criminal syndicates aiming to extort ransom in the form of money, weaponry, or both.
however, some abductions lack a clear motive.
the primary targets are foreign journalists, predominantly european individuals who have entered syria without official authorization from the syrian government to report on a conflict now entering its third year.
indigenous syrian journalists and locals collaborating with foreign news agencies have also fallen victim.
initially perceived as allies who could raise awareness about the atrocities perpetrated by president bashar al-assad's regime, foreign journalists are now sometimes viewed as unwelcome intruders with no vested interest in the conflict's resolution, which has resulted in over 100,000 fatalities.
french president emmanuel macron emphasized the vital need for communication with us president donald trump, describing it as "obvious and indispensable" ahead of their meeting aimed at bridging significant gaps and seeking common ground on security, defense, and various other issues.
macron's statement came after a discussion in paris with german chancellor angela merkel, with both expressing disappointment over trump's withdrawal from a global climate change agreement.
merkel referred to the differences as regrettable but stressed the importance of ongoing dialogue with the us.
upon arriving in paris for a brief 36-hour visit, president trump was set to engage with macron to address the syrian crisis and explore broader counterterrorism strategies.
modern chemical exposures are defined by a widespread contamination consisting of numerous chemicals, including many endocrine disruptors, present at low levels.
traditional approaches employed by regulatory agencies globally, which examine chemicals individually, struggle to address this complex pollution mixture adequately.
a significant hurdle lies in evaluating the cumulative effects of multiple endocrine disruptors and other chemicals, all at minimal concentrations.
our review traces the evolution of experimental and conceptual methodologies essential for analyzing mixtures at low doses, particularly focusing on endocrine disruptors.
evidence from nearly two decades of research indicates combined effects at levels approaching experimental thresholds.
an existing challenge is assessing the significance of this evidence due to insufficient knowledge about the array of endocrine disruptors forming these combined exposures.
it is imperative to bridge these knowledge gaps promptly, an issue currently under deliberation in exposome research discussions.
a report with certain details redacted regarding the incident in april was released by the pentagon on friday, shedding little new information on how 12 soldiers, airmen, marines, and sailors brought prostitutes to their hotel rooms.
the team was assigned to provide security for mr.
obama during his attendance at the summit of the americas in cartagena, colombia.
their misconduct was brought to light after nine civilian us secret service officers were also found engaging in similar behavior.
the report determined that the servicemen had violated us military regulations by fraternizing with sex workers and, in some instances, committing adultery.
additionally, their lack of discipline was evident through excessive drinking.
despite these infractions, the report assured that no national security threats were posed.
it was noted that the cartagena hotel, el caribe, permitted guests to have overnight visitors, often prostitutes, without breaking any colombian laws.
however, complaints were received from local witnesses regarding the overall conduct of the american personnel.
the report highlighted incidents where the servicemen disregarded hotel regulations by hosting overnight guests after 6 am, and explosive detection dog handlers allowed their animals to soil linens and the hotel grounds.
there were also reports of unidentified individuals, believed to be american, harassing young female greeters from the colombian ministry of foreign affairs.
the actions of the servicemen and agents during the scandal in april were a source of embarrassment for the obama administration and raised concerns about potential security risks.
nonetheless, the report ultimately found no evidence linking the women involved to criminal or terrorist groups, nor were they identified as victims of human trafficking networks.
according to informed sources, left-wing mps are cautioning education minister jay weatherill against challenging premier mike rann at this time, deeming any such move as ill-advised.
speculation regarding a leadership change has intensified following a recent advertiser poll revealing labor's primary support at 24 percent and mr.
rann's approval rating at 28 percent.
the poll indicates opposition leader isobel redmond as the preferred premier by 56 percent of respondents.
to address the party's current challenges, labor insiders are advocating for patience to allow the dust to settle following the poll and legal issues involving a labor mp facing child pornography charges.
sources suggest that a preferred course of action is for a negotiated leadership transition early next year from mr.
rau is considered the frontrunner due to the right's majority in the caucus, it is believed that at least four right mps are willing to back mr.
rann has dismissed the speculations, emphasizing the party's focus on its responsibilities amidst fluctuations in public opinion.
clem macintyre, head of adelaide university's school of history and politics, described the situation as complex, suggesting that significant structural changes may be necessary for labor to regain its prominence.
in india, there exists a unique cultural practice known as shastra puja or ayudha puja, translating to weapon worship.
this tradition occurs annually in september during a religious festival dedicated to the goddess durga.
participants adorn their weapons with flowers and religious ornaments, offering prayers as a gesture of gratitude for the protection these tools provide.
while in the past, bows, arrows, and swords were revered, the introduction and widespread adoption of firearms have integrated them into this ritual.
over time, this observance has evolved to encompass a broader range of tools essential for livelihood, such as vehicles, hand tools, and machinery.
among the kodava tribe, weapon worship holds particular significance, as weapons have been integral to their culture for generations.
they uphold a strong tradition of firearm ownership, instilling in their children a deep respect for guns along with a thorough understanding of the associated responsibilities and advantages.
this cultural practice showcases a profound reverence for the history and significance of weapons while emphasizing responsible firearm ownership within the community.
a north korean soldier successfully defected to south korea by swimming across the han river in the second such incident within a week.
the joint chiefs of staff of south korea disclosed that the individual crossed a narrow section of the fast-flowing river, enhancing his buoyancy by attaching foam to his shoulders.
in the previous week, another soldier from north korea defected by walking across the heavily fortified border that separates the two nations.
historically, the rate of defections stood at about one per year.
the most recent defector, believed to be in his early twenties, was sighted at gimpo, situated just to the west of the capital city seoul, as reported by yonhap news agency.
upon being noticed by a south korean marine, he shouted, "don't kill me, i am here to defect." the soldier is now set to undergo questioning by military authorities.
it is important to note that north and south korea are still in a state of war since the end of the korean conflict in 1953, which was resolved with a truce and not a formal peace treaty.
seoul has recorded that over 30,000 north koreans have defected to the south post-korean war, with most crossing through china, which shares the longest border with north korea.
the teachers' union in victoria has intensified its demand to discontinue religious education in state schools, adding to the pressure on the baillieu government regarding the contentious program.
the victorian branch, which represents 46,000 state school teachers, passed a resolution during its recent council meeting urging for the removal of special religious instruction within school hours.
the resolution emphasized the importance of keeping public education "free and secular." this move was backed by three victorian state school principals approached by the sunday age, who highlighted that religious education, primarily centered on christianity, is frequently poorly taught, conveys inappropriate messages to students, and consumes valuable classroom time.
the unfolding events come amidst increasing criticism from parents, teachers, and principals concerning the program, along with revelations about questionable administration practices and the content being delivered.
frank is a founding member of the horsemen clan, alongside death and the other three horsemen of the apocalypse.
as the sole mortal among them, frank became the fifth member of the clan almost by chance, as he was nearby when they needed another person to establish the group.
he shares a close friendship with death and often assists with their responsibilities in death's absence.
in the quest, missing, presumed death, frank steps in for death, managing his office and overseeing tasks such as serving as a death tutor, overseeing the soul reaper diversion, and facilitating the item reclamation process upon death.
similar to death, he assigns soul reaper tasks, grants access to the soul reaper reward shop, and can adjust loot beam settings.
additionally, he took on death's role during the gauntlet of souls halloween event.

players were given the task of fixing the firework on the clan keep's roof under his supervision.
the wall street journal reported on thursday that the department of justice is preparing to file a lawsuit against apple over accusations of colluding to manipulate e-book prices.
it was noted that publishers traditionally sold books to retailers at roughly half of the suggested retail price, allowing retailers the freedom to set their own prices.
however, apple shifted its e-book operations to an "agency model," where publishers could determine the selling price at a specific retailer while considering apple's 30 percent share of each sale.
additionally, apple imposed restrictions that prevented publishers from offering lower prices on other platforms.
walter isaacson quoted steve jobs revealing that publishers extended this model to other e-book sellers, requiring them to abide by apple's price guidelines to avoid underpricing.
the companies being scrutinized for their involvement with apple in this arrangement include simon and schuster, hachette book group, the penguin group, macmillan, and harpercollins.
the doj contends that these practices violate antitrust regulations and is seeking a settlement with the implicated entities.
if an agreement is not reached, the doj is prepared to take legal action against apple and the publishers involved.
many individuals in the american midwest trace their ancestry back to germany, with a significant number able to recount a cherished traditional holiday practice from the old country - the weihnachtsgurke, or christmas pickle.
they will explain that a pickle-shaped ornament is traditionally the final one to be placed on the tree on christmas eve, hidden amongst the pine needles.
the ornament may vary in appearance, with options such as a shiny or matte finish, gold swirls, or a miniature santa hat.
the legend dictates that the first child to spot the pickle in the morning will receive good fortune in the upcoming year, along with a special gift.
while this narrative seems feasible considering the germans' fondness for both christmas and traditions, it is interesting to note that this custom is virtually unheard of in germany itself.
in a survey conducted by the yougov polling agency in november, which included 2,057 german participants, a staggering 91 percent had never encountered this holiday tale associated with their homeland.

the united states space agency, nasa, is preparing to send a 3d printer into space next year to enable astronauts to produce spare parts and tools in a zero gravity environment.
this groundbreaking initiative aims to cut down on the expenses of future missions and marks the first utilization of a 3d printer in space.
the printer, about the size of a microwave oven, will need to endure the vibrations of lift-off and function securely within the confines of a space station.
nasa has enlisted the services of technology start-up made in space to develop the printer.
aaron kemmer, the company's ceo, illustrated the potential impact by envisioning an astronaut in need of urgent repairs on the international space station.
utilizing a 3d printer would enable the on-demand creation of required parts instead of relying on pre-existing supplies.
highlighting the significance of adaptability, dave korsmeyer, nasa's ames research center engineering director, emphasized that the ability to design and produce items in real-time through 3d printing is invaluable for space exploration.
additionally, nasa is exploring the use of 3d printing to produce small satellites that could be deployed from the international space station to transmute data back to earth.
while traditional 3d printing predominantly uses polymer materials in layer-by-layer construction, advancements now include the deployment of laser-melted titanium and nickel-chromium powders for the production of more robust components.
nasa recently achieved a milestone by conducting a successful test of a metal 3d printed rocket component, aligning with its commitment to diminishing the costs associated with space ventures.
consider this scenario: had any republicans shown their support for the bill, it could have provided a bipartisan shield for democrats to oppose it.
however, for the past 6 months, the gop indulged in celebrations and confidently predicted that obama would be a one-term president.
had they engaged in constructive dialogue and welcomed hesitant democrats, they might have successfully blocked the bill and projected a more reasonable image.
by strategically pretending to be undecided, a dozen republican representatives could have disrupted pelosi and reid's vote-counting efforts.
consequently, if the gop had engaged in dialogue and cooperative politicking with democrats and voters, they could have effectively prevented the bill from passing.
instead, their oscillation between self-congratulatory behavior and complaints about being excluded left them appearing obstinate and erratic.
luxembourg uzbek troops have been sternly suppressing dissent, and despite ongoing human rights concerns in the country, the eu has decided to lift an arms embargo against uzbekistan.
the embargo was initially enforced in 2005 following the government's violent crackdown on mainly unarmed opposition protesters in andijan, resulting in over 100 casualties.
eu foreign ministers believe that by lifting the embargo, they can encourage uzbek authorities to enhance human rights practices.
nonetheless, international human rights organizations have vehemently criticized this decision, citing the country's refusal to conduct an international inquiry into the andijan events in 2005.
the recent lifting of the arms embargo by the eu followed the release of political prisoners and the abolition of the death penalty in uzbekistan.
factors such as the country's strategic location in central asia, its abundant energy resources, and its support in providing aid to german troops in nearby afghanistan played a significant role in the decision.
eu foreign ministers have expressed ongoing concerns regarding human rights in uzbekistan and have agreed to reassess the situation in a year.
they have urged uzbek authorities to release all imprisoned human rights advocates, guarantee freedom of speech, and combat child labor.
however, organizations like human rights watch and amnesty international have condemned the eu's move, stating that it fails not only the victims of andijan, but also numerous human rights activists and journalists who continue to face persecution, torture, and detention in uzbekistan.

known as ta-ra to the gadigal people, the original inhabitants, the area now recognized as millers point derived its name from the windmills established in the hills and their proprietor john leighton, famously called jack the miller.
by the 1850s, millers point had transformed into a maritime community, predominantly occupied by residents and workers associated with the docks and the trade industry they supported.
following an outbreak of the bubonic plague in 1900, the government assumed authority over all the wharves and adjacent streets, initiating an extensive urban renewal project.
this era marked the development of significant public infrastructures in sydney, including the construction of wharves spanning from woolloomooloo to white bay and the iconic harbour bridge.
despite enduring the challenges of the plague, economic depression, and wartime pressures, the community in millers point faced a grave threat in the 1970s when the askin government proposed high-rise developments in the vicinity.
notably, the intervention of jack mundey and the green ban movement during the early 1970s successfully safeguarded many historic buildings, parks, and green spaces in the area.
the campaign was not solely aimed at preserving architectural heritage but also at safeguarding the welfare of millers point's low-income populace.

flacco had a challenging start on sunday night, with his initial three drives yielding two punts and an interception.
however, he later found his stride, guiding the ravens to touchdowns on each of the following three drives.
displaying finesse, he executed delicate throws from the pocket and showcased his arm strength by threading passes through tight windows.
despite the rocky beginning, he excelled in protecting the ball and making sound decisions.
leading two scoring drives in the fourth quarter, flacco orchestrated the final drive that ended with justin tucker's game-winning 27-yard field goal.
meanwhile, schaub faced a tough start on sunday afternoon, with the first snap resulting in a safety for the broncos.
yet, akin to flacco, he ignited following the early setback.
schaub delivered touchdown passes on the subsequent three possessions, featuring two impressive strikes over 50 yards.
his proficient play-action fakes, anticipation, and precise throws were instrumental in the long touchdown passes.
despite enduring a brutal third-quarter hit that tore part of his ear, schaub showed resilience by missing only one play.
a crucial third-down completion to andre johnson late in the fourth quarter secured the victory for the texans.
during his keynote address at the eurogamer expo, microsoft's corporate vice president, phil harrison, stated that the xbox one's launch on november 22 would mark the beginning of a "more than 10-year journey" for the platform.
harrison highlighted that through a variety of features, including cloud services, microsoft is committed to supporting the xbox one for over a decade.
in comparison, the xbox 360, which was launched in november 2005, will continue to be supported for at least three more years, as confirmed by microsoft's chief marketing and strategy officer, yusuf mehdi.
mehdi emphasized that microsoft's focus is not just on the launch date but on the ongoing improvement and adaptation of the console.
harrison also noted that microsoft has 300,000 dedicated servers available for the xbox one, which will enhance features such as multiplayer, networking services, cloud processing, and artificial intelligence.
nayarit, a western mexican state, has recently joined places like chihuahua and mexico city in legalizing same-sex marriage.
according to the yucatan times, the state's congress passed an amendment to the state civil code this week, signaling the imminent formalization of the decision.
this development in nayarit follows a pivotal decision by the nation's supreme court, which served as a catalyst for such progressive changes.
the supreme court's ruling in june declared the limitation of marriages to opposite-sex couples as unconstitutional, setting a precedent for the states to reconsider their laws.
while the ruling did not mandate states to immediately issue marriage licenses to all, it provided a framework for local jurisdictions to review and revise their marriage policies in light of the court's stance.
some regions, like mexico city, had already embraced marriage equality nearly six years prior to nayarit's decision.
moreover, the mexican supreme court's forward-thinking approach was further underscored in august when it abolished bans on adoption for same-sex couples.
according to gallup's annual world affairs survey, only 48 percent of self-identified democrats express more sympathy towards israelis than palestinians in middle east tensions.
in contrast, 83 percent of republicans align with israelis.
the overall statistic for all americans stands at 62 percent.
despite these numbers, the trend analysis based on party affiliation reveals more complexity.
the 48 percent of democrats supporting israelis has notably increased since the mid-1990s, resembling a similar upward trajectory among republicans.
however, within the last year, democratic support for israelis has decreased by approximately ten points, which mirrors a decline observed across all parties after a surge of support during the first gulf war.
gallup implies that the timing of the survey could have influenced these shifts, coinciding with the escalating controversy surrounding israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu's impending speech to congress.
criticisms both in the us and israel regarding the politicization of this event have potentially impacted these sentiments, as indicated by gallup's findings.
the survey also conceals the broader sentiment towards israel among americans.
despite a slight drop from the 72 percent recorded in 2014, 70 percent of americans still view israel favorably.
this favorable view has displayed a consistent upward trend since the 1990s.
a massive cloud of dark smoke was visible throughout the area, with witnesses reporting that the explosion's impact had derailed several train wagons.
the interior ministry spokesman, shota utiashvili, revealed that multiple explosions had occurred near an abandoned georgian military base where russian troops, upon departing gori, had left behind a cache of munitions confiscated from the georgian army.
he suggested that either the munitions stockpile or the railway track may have been booby-trapped by the russian forces.
fortunately, there were no reported casualties.
georgian authorities had planned to aid thousands of refugees in returning to gori on sunday following a thorough mine-clearing operation in the town near the border with south ossetia.
prime minister lado gurgenidze emphasized the importance of assessing the damages once the fire had been brought under control, noting the significant role the railway played not just in georgia's economy but also in that of neighboring countries.
the railway line passes through tbilisi and branches out to the black sea ports of poti and batumi, as well as to the turkish border.
among the train wagons, one was identified as belonging to azpetrol, a company based in baku, azerbaijan.
meanwhile, president sarkozy called for a special summit of eu leaders in brussels on 1 september to address the georgian crisis.
the summit, requested by several european countries, aims to deliberate on future eu-russia relations and provide aid to georgia.
the conflict between russia and georgia ensued after tbilisi's failed attempt to reclaim south ossetia, supported by moscow since its secession in 1992, through a sudden offensive on 7 august following clashes between georgian and south ossetian forces.

following discussions between russian and un officials, it was concluded that the exiled government and rebels should initiate dialogue to seek a political resolution.
additionally, the talks addressed the urgent need to address the escalating humanitarian crisis in yemen, with fears mounting over an imminent widespread famine.
as per un reports, the conflict in yemen, which escalated when saudi arabia entered the fray in march 2015 after houthi rebels captured sana'a and ousted president hadi, has led to the deaths of at least 10,000 individuals.
despite multiple attempts at negotiation brokered by the un, a lasting ceasefire has remained elusive.
recent reports from the houthi-controlled saba news agency revealed discussions between the charge d'affaires of the russian embassy in yemen, andrei chernfall, and the houthi minister of foreign affairs.
this encounter triggered allegations from supporters of the exiled hadi government that russia has taken a biased position in the conflict.
while russia has openly criticized saudi arabia's involvement in yemen, it refrained from voting in favor of un security council resolutions advocating for arms embargoes against the iran-backed group and demanding the withdrawal of houthi rebels from seized territories.
former president ali abdullah saleh commended russian president vladimir putin for his constructive stance on the yemen conflict and hailed moscow as yemen's closest ally on the global stage.

in massachusetts, parishioners have reluctantly come to terms with the closure of their church after an 11-year fight to keep it open.
despite a dedicated group of about 100 worshippers at st frances x cabrini church in scituate maintaining a continuous vigil, their recent final appeal to the us supreme court against the decision by the roman catholic archdiocese of boston to shutter the church was rejected.
the emotional conclusion occurred during a poignant service on sunday, which was described as a poignant "celebration of faith and transition" where parishioners exchanged embraces and shed tears.
symbolically, quilts representing each year of the vigil were solemnly removed from the church walls and carried out as the service ended.
the decision to close st frances x cabrini, along with over 75 other parishes, was prompted by declining attendance, a clergy shortage, and deteriorating buildings, aggravated by prior child sex abuse scandals within the archdiocese.
despite a decade-long battle culminating in a failed legal challenge that even reached the vatican, ultimately the state courts upheld the archdiocese's right to evict the protesters as the legal property owner.
an archdiocese spokesperson expressed hope that the displaced worshippers would find solace in attending another church within the district.
captured by a flying cameraman above iceland's bardarbunga volcano, footage shows lava spewing up to 70 meters into the sky.
the emissions predominantly comprised of vapour and gas, considered less hazardous to air travel than ash, billowed from the volcano.
seismic disturbances since august 16 have fractured the vatnajokull glacier to the northeast, allowing molten lava to flow through the ruptures.
the current alert status remains at orange, suggesting escalating restiveness and a heightened likelihood of an eruption.
concerns mount as the lava flows extend towards the north and potentially underneath the glacier, with ongoing tremors signaling the potential for a violent sub-glacial eruption.
experts fear this could trigger significant ice melt, leading to extensive flooding and explosive ash eruptions.
recent volcanic escalation has resulted in an expanding lava field covering over four square kilometers, originating approximately 28 miles from the main bardarbunga volcano beneath the colossal vatnajokull glacier in iceland's remote and thinly populated eastern region, a popular spot for summertime hikers.
tourists were evacuated from the area due to intense seismic events preceding the volcanic activity surge in the past 72 hours.

researchers from china and singapore have utilized electrospinning technology to develop a stand-alone catalyst capable of producing hydrogen and oxygen, with potential for large-scale industrial production.
in water-splitting devices, electrocatalysis is used for oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution.
while platinum-based catalysts are commonly recognized as highly efficient, their cost and durability limitations hinder widespread application.
to address these challenges, electrospinning has been employed to produce fibers that enable the creation of scalable electrocatalysts.
however, previous catalysts have faced issues such as limited active sites and inefficient mass transport pathways.
shengjie peng from the national university of singapore and xiaohong qin from donghua university, leading a team of researchers, successfully resolved these shortcomings.
by synthesizing porous, channel-rich carbon nanofibers from a combination of pyrolyzed electrospun polyacrylonitrile and cellulose acetate nanofibers, the researchers were able to introduce essential active sites and improve mass transport pathways.
they incorporated iron-based precursors into the spinning solution as cost-effective and efficient electrocatalysts.
the resulting novel material enabled the team to fabricate a flexible and stable 180 x 80cm electrocatalyst with impressive performance.
their breakthrough is anticipated to accelerate the development of next-generation flexible electrodes.
reports have stated that the condition of the italian actor who fell into a coma following a mishap during a live theatrical performance is worsening.
raphael schumacher, aged 27, was part of the cast of mirages at the teatro lux in pisa when an audience member noticed his distress.
according to pisa today, schumacher is currently unresponsive to treatment, and authorities are treating the incident as a tragic accident.
investigators are now focused on determining if the theatre may have been remiss in adhering to safety protocols to protect actors.
police, who cordoned off the theatre and questioned both cast and spectators over the weekend, have concluded after speaking with the individual who aided schumacher - thought to be a recent medical graduate - that the fall was indeed accidental.
the theatre-goer intervened upon noticing the actor, who had a bag over his head, in distress and assisted him to the ground as his body convulsed.
schumacher was swiftly rushed to the hospital, where he remains in a coma.
it was noted that the actor had altered the ending of the scene, which was originally intended to involve a gun rather than a hanging, leading to the unfortunate incident.
the concept of phase transformations in periodic cellular materials is expanded by introducing materials with unit cells containing multiple stable configurations, where each configuration represents a stable phase.
transitioning between these phases within the cellular material is considered a phase transformation.
a specific cellular material showcasing phase transformations is examined to determine the unit cell geometry elements influencing its mechanical properties.
moreover, an analytical model is introduced to depict its constitutive behavior.
these materials displaying phase transformations exhibit hysteresis with extended, jagged loading and unloading plateaus, making them advantageous for energy absorption applications.
although these phase-transforming cellular materials exhibit energy absorption capabilities comparable to metal and polymeric honeycombs, a notable distinction is their fully recoverable deformations.
during the senate debate in louisiana on tuesday, there was bipartisan discussion regarding medical marijuana.
senator mary landrieu, the democratic incumbent, expressed her opposition to the idea of allowing marijuana for medical purposes.
in contrast, her republican challenger, representative bill cassidy, who is also a doctor, voiced his support for it.
this divergence in opinion is noteworthy as typically, states that lean towards the democrats are more inclined to embrace medical marijuana, while republicans are often less supportive.
despite landrieu's stance against medical marijuana, she drew attention to her apparent approval of keg stands on college campuses.
this was highlighted by buzzfeed's andrew kaczynski, who noted that the senator was pictured partaking in a keg stand with a man in his late 20s at a louisiana state university tailgating event in september, as reported by the hill.
it's important to note that excessive drinking is a significant cause of mortality among americans aged 20 to 64, as indicated by a centers for disease control and prevention report from june.
in contrast, marijuana has never been linked to a fatal overdose, although it may heighten the risk of involvement in traffic accidents.
a group of fortunate commuters received the offer of a complimentary subway ticket in exchange for doing 30 squats, captured in a video shared by youtube user olympic changes at a subway station in moscow.

the detainees are housed in extremely overcrowded cells where they are deprived of basic hygiene essentials such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, and soap.
they endure the unrelenting foul smell of excrement and waste in their cramped living quarters, with walls tainted by mucus and blood.
these individuals are forced to wear the same soiled clothing for days and even weeks without any means to wash or change into clean undergarments.
accessing a shared uncleaned toilet amidst a sea of other inmates proves to be a daunting task, leading to the spread of untreated illnesses and infections among the population.
the lack of proper hygiene facilities results in inmates going without showers for extended periods, while they shiver in the cold clutching onto thin blankets, pleading with guards for warmer coverings.
basic necessities like menstrual hygiene products are not provided, and medical attention, including essential medications, is routinely denied, causing inmates to suffer from significant weight loss and dehydration due to the unpalatable water source available to them.
the agonizing cries of fellow inmates grappling with unchecked medical conditions resonate through the cell block, as these individuals languish without access to resources like books, legal materials, entertainment, or exposure to natural light.
queens park rangers are planning to send joey barton on loan to a championship club to serve his 12-game suspension at the beginning of the upcoming season.
barton's ban was imposed after his red card against manchester city on the last day of the previous season, resulting in him being relieved of his captaincy at loftus road.
with more matches played in the championship during the initial part of the season, the 29-year-old midfielder could potentially return to qpr's squad by november.
blackburn are currently favored to secure barton's loan deal, although nottingham forest have also shown interest in signing him.
david worrall, a winger, scored a magnificent free-kick that helped southend defeat bury, consequently keeping their chances of securing automatic promotion from league two alive.
by successfully curving the ball in from 25 yards, the former bury player drew his team level in points with wycombe wanderers, who held the third position at the time.
despite strong efforts from tom soares, joe riley, and danny rose of bury, they couldn't find the net despite the support of over 8,000 fans who were let in for free.
this decision came following the previous abandonment of the match in march due to heavy rain after just 10 minutes, leading to the largest home crowd for bury in almost two decades.
while bury performed better in the first half, southend managed to shift the momentum in the second half, with substitute worrall's goal in the 74th minute breaking the deadlock after a foul by kelvin etuhu on jack payne.
bury's nathan cameron missed a late opportunity to equalize, and a save by southend's goalkeeper daniel bentley, securing their seventh consecutive clean sheet, denied ryan lowe's attempt to score.
in queensland, the legal age for consensual anal sex has been reduced to 16 years to align with the age of consent for other forms of sexual activity, and the term "sodomy" has been eliminated from the criminal code following a decision by the queensland parliament to eradicate a historical source of discrimination.
formerly, the age of consent for anal intercourse was 18, while it stood at 16 for all other sexual activities.
health experts convened in may of this year to review the criminal code and concluded that harmonizing the age of consent for anal intercourse with that of other sexual activities would have a positive impact on sexual health.

according to a survey conducted by the market research firm gfk in 22 countries, 47 percent of the 27,000 participants believed that the top priority for companies should be "providing good jobs for people." following closely behind was "producing good quality products or services" at 41 percent, and "being environmentally responsible" at 37 percent.
interestingly, when analyzing responses based on gender, women identified "protecting the health and safety of its workers" as their third most important priority.
it's worth noting that in china, this particular aspect was ranked highest overall, while in hong kong it claimed second place.
despite germany's reputation for being eco-conscious, the survey revealed that the responsibility towards the environment was not as highly regarded compared to other countries.
in mexico, prioritizing "being environmentally responsible" stood out as the top concern for companies.
on the other hand, in turkey, argentina, canada, china, and italy, it was ranked second.
the us respondents placed it in third position.
in the uk and belgium, there was a significant emphasis on companies paying their fair share of taxes, a sentiment less significant in germany.
the survey participants were interviewed online and were asked to select their top three priorities from a selection of 13 options.
award-winning film director ang lee is making his debut in television by directing the pilot episode of the upcoming series, tyrant.
this new project comes on the heels of his success with the 2012 film life of pi, for which he received his second academy award just the previous month.
tyrant revolves around an average american family entangled in the tumultuous politics of a middle eastern nation.
the show is set to start filming on the fx cable channel in the summer, with acclaimed producers howard gordon and gideon raff from homeland on board as executive producers.

this achievement added to lee's previous oscar for brokeback mountain in 2006.
geno smith is not shying away from the new york media as the new york giants are poised to acquire him as a free-agent quarterback, according to reports from espn's adam schefter and jordan raanan.
a source informed schefter that smith is set to undergo a physical with the team over the weekend and is likely to finalize the deal on monday, pending a clean bill of health.
assuming his recovery from last october's acl injury has progressed well, smith will be rejoining former jets teammate brandon marshall as a backup to eli manning.
smith, who started in 29 games during his initial two seasons, notably lost his starting position before the 2015 season following a notorious incident where he suffered a broken jaw at the hands of then-teammate ik enemkpali.
despite only one start over the past two years, occurring in week 7 of the previous season, he unfortunately sustained an acl tear after just eight pass attempts.
the tragic overdose fatalities of two young men from the hunter region who suffered from being "cooked from the inside" have raised concerns about the potential resurgence of deadly synthetic drugs.
both individuals passed away on thursday after experiencing separate prolonged and intense psychotic episodes, resulting in dangerously high core body temperatures, one exceeding 42 degrees.
with a history of methamphetamine use, it is suspected that the men consumed this substance leading up to their deaths, though authorities are considering the possibility that toxicology screenings and autopsies might reveal an alternative substance as the cause of their demise.
a senior detective expressed to fairfax media, "it emphasizes the critical message that individuals often remain uninformed about the substances they are ingesting, potentially leading to fatal consequences." collingwood may have to play the remainder of the season without their captain, scott pendlebury as he recently underwent a second surgery to mend his broken finger on monday night.
the 29-year-old sustained the injury during a match against gold coast and sat out the team's victory against west coast last sunday after the first surgery last week.
coach buckley elaborated that the subsequent surgery involved inserting wire into the bone to aid in the finger's recovery, leading to pendlebury's absence for a minimum of four weeks.
with only five games left in the season, the coach admitted that it was uncertain if the captain would return to play this year.
buckley mentioned that pendlebury experienced discomfort post-operation and emphasized the importance of allowing him ample time, roughly four weeks, for proper healing.
expressing disappointment at the situation, buckley encouraged pendlebury to prioritize his recovery diligently while acknowledging the team's realistic approach to the situation.

the exploration of the history of rock music carries on as we delve into the narratives of two iconic and genuine american bands: nirvana and rem.
this rock saga progresses by detailing the distinctive destinies of two prominent and authentic bands from america: nirvana and rem, uncovering the covert connections between them that nearly salvaged the life of nirvana's troubled frontman, kurt cobain.
the release of nirvana's nevermind album in 1991 triggered the 'grunge' phenomenon that propelled the seattle music scene into the spotlight, providing a voice for disaffected youth marginalized by the reagan era.
despite nirvana's rise to stardom, cobain grappled with his newfound fame and his band's increasing mainstream popularity, for he was a reluctant figurehead.
originating from the underground and college music realm championed by bands like rem and pixies, nirvana's journey is intertwined with the evolution of rem, who also found themselves drawn to seattle.
this documentary elucidates the bond that blossomed between lead singer michael stipe and cobain.
although their camaraderie was insufficient to preserve cobain, who tragically took his own life in 1994, his legacy, capturing both triumph and despair, perpetuates a profound influence on the entire rock landscape.
time reveals the sacrifices we must make; if i had the words, i would share them with you.
should we shed tears at the sight of clowns in play, should we falter as musicians sway, time's response will merely be an "i warned you." no prophecies to foresee, but i convey, my love for you in ways beyond display.
if i had the words, i would share them with you.
whence the winds blow, reasons do not delay, leaves wither in their silent foray; time's retort will echo, "i warned you." perhaps roses aspire to bloom in today, a steadfast vision determined to stay.
if i had the words, i would share them with you.
imagine lions flee and brooks go astray, soldiers deserting without relaying; will time's voice only echo, "i warned you"?
if i had the words, i would share them with you.
an indonesian diplomat based in saudi arabia has expressed strong disapproval regarding the decision to overturn the conviction of a saudi woman who had been found guilty of physically abusing and torturing her indonesian maid.
referring to the initial three-year prison sentence as a groundbreaking ruling, didi wahyudi conveyed to the bbc that the subsequent acquittal has eliminated a significant opportunity to hold torturers accountable.
up to this point, saudi arabia has refrained from commenting on the matter.
the plight of indonesian women working in saudi households has been a cause for concern, as numerous instances of mistreatment by their employers have been reported.
recent events in mecca, where two individuals were apprehended following the tragic death of their indonesian maid, have once again shed light on the pervasive abuse encountered by migrant domestic workers in the country.
despite these revelations, perpetrators have seldom faced penalties commensurate with the severity of their actions, typically being subjected to fines rather than imprisonment.
the case of sumiati binti salan mustapa, a 23-year-old domestic worker who sustained severe injuries including broken bones and burns, garnered global attention and prompted the indonesian president to demand justice for the victim.
in january, the 53-year-old female employer was sentenced to three years in jail by a court in medina.
however, following an appeal, she was acquitted due to alleged insufficiency of evidence.
the diplomat, didi wahyudi of the indonesian consulate in saudi arabia, lamented the missed opportunity for a significant legal precedent.
he highlighted that upholding the original verdict would have set an important milestone, symbolizing accountability for offenders in such cases.
by overturning the sentence, wahyudi emphasized that all perpetrators have been absolved, casting a shadow on the prospects of achieving justice for victims of abuse.
a gas explosion at the la preciosa mine in sardinata, north-eastern colombia, has tragically claimed the lives of 21 individuals, according to officials.
this incident, believed to have been triggered by a gas accumulation, occurred at a mine previously marked by tragedy.
in february 2007, over 30 workers lost their lives in a similar gas explosion at the same site.
following the recent devastating event, colombian mining minister carlos rodado promptly ordered the indefinite closure of the mine and announced heightened oversight of mines nationwide.
rescue efforts were initially impeded by a rock collapse and dangerous gas levels within the mine.
distressing scenes of worried relatives gathered at the entrance anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones were captured on television.
described as a basic and small-scale operation lacking adequate safety protocols by the bbc's correspondent jeremy mcdermott in colombia, the explosion took place during a shift change early on wednesday morning.
situated near the venezuelan border, sardinata falls within colombia's norte de santander department.
this incident adds to a series of recent mining disasters in the country, including a deadly explosion at the san fernando mine in amaga, antioquia province, which claimed 70 lives in june of the prior year, as well as the loss of nine workers in two mines in the cundinamarca region in november.
despite colombia's significant coal resources and ranking as one of the largest coal exporters globally, mining safety remains a critical concern, with accidents persisting despite substantial improvements in the industry over recent decades.
last week, a secret service agent assigned to vice president mike pence was arrested and charged with solicitation after reportedly engaging with a prostitute in a maryland hotel room.
the hotel manager alerted authorities due to suspicious behavior, and police apprehended the agent leaving the prostitute's room.
upon self-reporting the arrest, the agent was suspended, required to relinquish his equipment and firearms, and placed on administrative leave, with his security clearance revoked.
a spokesperson for the secret service acknowledged the incident, emphasizing the agency's commitment to investigating allegations of criminal activity through its office of professional responsibility.
"the rasping of gilman" narrates the story of social outcasts uniting against the antagonistic forces in their town, including the community itself.
the protagonist, gilman, residing in his step-father's basement and feeding on old army rations, forges a bond with a group of b-movie enthusiasts.
this newfound friendship sparks gilman's interest in cult films and seeking retribution.
although the narrative delves into mundane day-to-day encounters that might not significantly propel the central plot, the well-developed characters sustain the reader's interest in their daily struggles.
the author, milligan, adeptly captures the essence of being an outcast in a provincial setting.
the tale unfolds with shared viewings of low-quality films with the group, offering a glimpse into their camaraderie.
despite my seasoned experience with horror literature, i found milligan's portrayal of gore to be skillful.
the shocking instances of violence, beginning with a severed finger early in the story, catch the reader off guard due to the narrative's light-hearted and comical essence.
the transitions to grim and gruesome scenes evoke more of a sense of campy delight than a plunge into darkness, maintaining a balance between shock value and entertainment.
the enigma of the unidentified object near a westerly beach remains unsolved at the moment.
president of the east beach association, peter brockmann, mentioned that efforts were made by divers to inspect the object last weekend, but it is currently buried under two feet of sand.
an initial plan to extract it was hindered by stormy conditions caused by hurricane gert.
brockmann explained that the storm was responsible for concealing the object.
he informed nbc10 that the timing of when the sand might shift back from the object is unpredictable.
the association is now considering using high-pressure water to dislodge the sand at low tide.
brockmann anticipates providing further updates later this week.
in order to facilitate students' ability to share their work with classmates, receive feedback, and enhance the learning experience for everyone, my students require a document projector and stand.
at our school, we prioritize empowering students to take ownership of their learning journey.
this responsibility includes presenting their work, elucidating the processes involved, and engaging in discussions with peers.

police in ghaziabad reported that a delhi university student was sexually assaulted and subjected to a brutal attack involving dogs as a punishment for his association with a female classmate, allegedly orchestrated by the girl's father.
the father, identified as rajesh mavi, has since been apprehended, with authorities actively pursuing his accomplices.
the distressing incident was brought to light on wednesday, according to a police official in the vicinity, where robin kasana, a fellow student at delhi university, had a friendship with a female counterpart residing in the same semi-rural locality.
upon discovering their connection, rajesh mavi, a prominent local figure, purportedly dispatched a group of men to forcibly take robin to his farmhouse in the tila-shahbazpur region.
in a harrowing sequence of events, one of the men assaulted robin, commanded dogs to attack him, and inflicted further harm by rubbing salt and chillies into his wounds.
moreover, they callously posted lewd images on social media using a fabricated profile.
learning of the ordeal, robin's relatives intervened promptly, rescuing him from the farmhouse but faced intimidation.
undaunted, they reported the matter to the loni police station.
superintendent of police jagdish sharma confirmed the detention of the primary offender and ongoing efforts to apprehend the other perpetrators.
president-elect donald trump posted on twitter on saturday, suggesting that the ongoing discussion about the hacking of democratic email accounts was fueled by the party's embarrassment following their significant election loss in november.
this statement was made in several tweets the morning after the release of a declassified report by us intelligence agencies, confirming russian involvement in cyber activities to influence the election in favor of trump over democrat hillary clinton.
trump's tweets on saturday continued to politicize the issue, contrasting with some senior republicans in congress who advocated for stronger sanctions against russia than those imposed by president barack obama.
in one of his tweets, trump expressed, "the only reason there is talk about the poorly defended dnc hack is due to the dems' substantial loss and resulting embarrassment!" this sentiment was expressed despite clinton winning the popular vote, while trump secured victory through the electoral college.

royal staff members from various locations in the uk have been summoned for an urgent meeting at buckingham palace, as reported by sources.
despite speculation, the bbc clarified that the meeting does not pertain to the health of the queen or prince philip.
this announcement has stirred online reactions, causing a buzz as aides from locations such as balmoral, sandringham, and windsor castle are converging on the palace for a mid-morning gathering.
notably, the bbc reassured that such meetings occur approximately once a year and are not a cause for alarm.
royal correspondent peter hunt confirmed that the gathering is unrelated to the monarch's or the duke of edinburgh's health.
the daily mail added that the meeting will be led by lord chamberlain, the highest-ranking official of the royal household, and the queen's private secretary, sir christopher geidt.
to manage a growing hunger strike among prisoners at guantanamo bay, the united states has bolstered its medical personnel at the detention center.
approximately 40 nurses and specialists were deployed over the weekend, according to camp spokesperson lt col samuel house.
out of 166 detainees, 100 are currently participating in the hunger strike, with 21 of them receiving force-feeding through a tube.
the detainees are protesting their indefinite detention, as most of them are held without formal charges.
the hunger strike, which commenced in february at the us facility in cuba, has recently escalated.
although hunger strikes are not uncommon at guantanamo, this protest is notable for its duration and scope.
authorities at guantanamo have refuted allegations that the strike began due to mishandling of the koran during cell searches.
on 13 april, violence erupted at the prison during a transfer of inmates from communal cellblocks where surveillance cameras and windows had been obscured.
some inmates brandished makeshift weapons and were met with non-lethal ammunition, resulting in no significant injuries.
despite approximately 100 detainees being cleared for release, they remain in the facility due to congressional restrictions and concerns about potential mistreatment upon returning to their home countries.
established in 2002 to house individuals captured in counter-terrorism efforts post-9/11, the military detention center continues to face scrutiny and ongoing controversies.
afghan president hamid karzai has gained the approval of tribal elders and community leaders to engage in negotiations for a 10-year strategic partnership with the us, allowing for the potential presence of us troops beyond the designated exit date of 2014.
however, the traditional assembly, known as the loya jirga, conducted in the capital kabul, has set forth specific conditions for the proposed pact.
although the jirga's decisions are not legally binding, the final authority rests with the parliament.
the delegates at the loya jirga endorsed the agreement but imposed conditions that could complicate the path to reaching a final accord, as reported by the bbc's orla guerin in kabul.
the prolonged negotiations, which have extended for nearly a year, saw delegates calling for an end to night raids, a contentious issue among afghans yet deemed essential by us military leaders.
additionally, the delegates insisted on detainees being placed under afghan custody and for accountability for us nationals who commit offenses in afghanistan.
the assembly also supported peace dialogues with taliban insurgents willing to renounce violence, though the feasibility of finding willing participants remains uncertain.
the nhl entry draft is a crucial event in the hockey world, as it is the mechanism through which young talents enter the league as experienced players phase out.
it essentially serves as the lifeblood of the nhl, ensuring a continuous influx of fresh talent.
the success of a team's draft picks is subjective and varies based on their individual needs and strategies.

as we reflect on the initial ten drafts of the new millennium during the summer lull, it is an opportune moment to examine how effectively the kings made their selections and evaluate their performance.

cpython relies on reference counting to manage the object's lifespan, considered a common practice due to its simplicity in implementation.
despite its widespread acceptance, dealing with reference counting can be complex for those unfamiliar with it.
the cpython api introduces intricacies to reference counting; varying on its state, references can be new, borrowed, stolen, or copied.
functions typically return new and borrowed references; when you receive a new reference, you become its owner and must decrement the reference count when no longer needed.
borrowed references allow viewing, requiring an increment in the reference count if the object is to be retained.
stolen and copied references, conversely, are passed as function arguments, relieving the responsibility of managing the reference count.
while comprehending each function's handling of references in c may seem daunting, the design often streamlines reference-count adjustments, reducing the manual intervention required.
however, for the writer, managing the complexities associated with potential side effects and interactions of reference counts remains a challenge, requiring meticulous attention to eliminate any bugs related to reference counting intricacies.
dr janina ramirez kicks off her series by delving into the transformation of monasteries from a culture of extreme isolation and self-deprivation to becoming centers of anglo-saxon art, industry, and education.
she embarks on her quest on the desolate skellig st michael, off the east coast of ireland, which houses the oldest surviving monastery in the british isles.
dr ramirez investigates the challenging lives of early monks, narrating the narrative of the introduction of hermitic irish monasticism in anglo-saxon northumberland.
monastic establishments like lindisfarne and whitby emerged as bastions of civilization and literary excellence in the rough anglo-saxon environment, creating remarkable artistic pieces such as the lindisfarne gospels and st cuthbert's pectoral cross.
a contrasting form of structured communal monasticism from rome was adopted in southern britain, resulting in a clash explored by janina between these two conflicting monastic doctrines.
the triumphant faction would go on to reshape the english culture and terrain, only to face obliteration by a fresh wave of barbarian invaders.
bayern munich manager pep guardiola has stated that he will provide an update on his future at the bundesliga champions next week.
the 44-year-old spaniard, who has been linked with manchester city, has guided bayern to two titles since assuming the role in 2013 but is set to be out of contract in june.
guardiola did not address questions about his future on tuesday but hinted that a decision is imminent.
reports from spanish newspaper marca suggested that guardiola has already informed bayern of his departure, believing that both he and the club would benefit from a change due to his demanding coaching style.
speculation from spain in recent weeks has indicated that the former barcelona coach has agreed to join manchester city at the end of the current season.
despite the uncertainty surrounding guardiola's future, bayern munich currently holds a five-point lead in the german league as they gear up for their final 2015 fixture against hannover this saturday.
aldf new orleans - an animal rights organization has filed a lawsuit to rescue candy the chimpanzee from an amusement park where reports indicate she is engaging in smoking cigarettes and being offered soft drinks instead of water.
the lawsuit, brought forth by the animal legal defense fund in baton rouge, contends that candy is housed in substandard conditions at a baton rouge park and advocates for her relocation to a sanctuary.
the legal action, initiated on tuesday, is supported by two women who have been advocating for candy's move from the dixie landin' park.
according to the lawsuit, the women have witnessed visitors tossing lit cigarettes into candy's enclosure for her to smoke.
attorney carter dillard highlighted that this lawsuit marks the first legal challenge under a new federal regulation mandating equivalent protection for captive chimpanzees compared to their wild counterparts.
the park's owner, sam haynes, has yet to provide a response to requests for comments.
legislation has been introduced allowing authorities in australia to gather and monitor individuals' internet activities, comprising their browsing history, social media interactions, and emails.
these laws are aimed at suspected cyber criminals but fall short of the more extensive proposed regulations that sought to retain all internet usage data for every australian for two years on grounds of national security.
under the new laws passed recently, law enforcement agencies, such as state and federal police, are empowered to oblige isps to maintain internet records of individuals under suspicion of cyber crimes like fraud and child exploitation.
these records will only be preserved from the moment of the request, and access will be granted to authorities only upon obtaining a warrant.
the challenge arises as some isps retain data for a brief period, whereas others routinely erase user data daily, posing difficulties for authorities in collecting evidence against suspects.

kersley appou, a 43-year-old mauritian striker, has surpassed roger milla as the oldest footballer to represent an african national team.
milla, who previously held the record, achieved the feat at the age of 42 years and 39 days when he scored against russia during the 1994 world cup.
despite losing his african national team record, milla retains his title as the oldest player and goal scorer in world cup history.
appou made his mark in mauritius's africa cup of nations qualifying match against mauritania at the age of 43 years and 354 days, as he aims to continue his playing career.
however, he is still short of the world record held by macdonald taylor sr from the us virgin islands, who played at the age of 46 years and 217 days.

it's crucial to educate children on the important indicators when they want to pick up a cat.
emphasize the necessity of only approaching a cat that is calm, relaxed, and shows trust towards them.
it is essential to avoid situations where a child could potentially get scratched by a cat that is not comfortable being handled.
most cats will clearly communicate when they do not wish to be picked up.
while it is possible to build trust with domestic cats through gentle petting on their heads, it is not advisable to lift a cat that is agitated or not receptive to being picked up.
if a cat tries to escape, bites, scratches, or swats at you, it is best to give the cat space and attempt picking it up at a later time.
a recent legionnaires' disease outbreak in new york, the largest in the city's history, has resulted in a death toll of at least 12 individuals, prompting health authorities to urgently address the spread of the harmful bacteria.
over 100 cases have been identified in the south bronx, a community known for its economic challenges.
investigations have linked the legionella bacteria to cooling towers in multiple buildings in the area.
vulnerable populations, particularly the elderly, face higher risks associated with this type of pneumonia.
notably, the deceased were predominantly above 40 years old and had pre-existing health conditions.
extensive sanitation efforts are underway to eradicate the bacteria throughout the bronx.
legionnaires' disease is not contagious among people but is primarily disseminated through air conditioning and similar systems.
mayor bill de blasio of new york, amid criticism for the city's crisis management, acknowledged the unprecedented challenges encountered in combating this outbreak.
the disease's 10-day incubation period has caused delays in case reporting.
nonetheless, authorities are hopeful that no new cases have emerged since august 3.
the response has been marred by a lack of coordination between city and state health departments, exemplified by conflicting information during separate news conferences held by governor andrew cuomo and mayor de blasio.
this discord between the two prominent democratic leaders has complicated the overall handling of the situation, adding to previous instances of strained collaboration.
amidst the spotlight on turkey's referendum vote on sunday, a wikipedia user utilized the opportunity to criticize turkish president recep tayyip erdogan, who is poised to have his authority strengthened through the outcome of the "yes" vote.
in a controversial move, the user branded erdogan as a dictator in the opening sentence of the english-language wikipedia article on the president.
although the edit has been subsequently deleted, it remains inaccessible for unregistered users to modify for a minimum of one week.
the english-language wikipedia depiction of president erdogan at approximately 20:00 utc on sunday, april 16, was the subject of this incident.
the user's critique aligns with broader sentiments disapproving of erdogan's governance.
in the aftermath of the failed military coup in july 2016, turkey declared a state of emergency, a measure heavily censured by international leaders for its perceived drift towards authoritarian rule.
under the state of emergency, turkish authorities acquired the ability to dismiss public servants and prolong the detention period of suspects without formal charges.
over 100,000 individuals, including military personnel, law enforcement officers, and educators, have been relieved of their duties since the commencement of the state of emergency.
furthermore, in connection with the coup attempt, around 40,000 people have been detained on suspicion of involvement with the us-based cleric fethullah gulen, whom turkey accuses of orchestrating the coup endeavor last year.
the referendum held on sunday seeks to enhance erdogan's authority, granting him the power to craft budgets, dissolve the parliament, and appoint or remove government officials and judges without parliamentary endorsement.
a white teenager named trevor richards, who immigrated from south africa to the united states six years ago, found himself in hot water when he nominated himself for the "distinguished african-american student of the year" award at westside high school in omaha, nebraska.
the 16-year-old's self-nomination led to his suspension from school, with authorities accusing him of showing disrespect towards his black peers.
trevor, believed to be the only student at the school with african heritage, along with two friends, displayed campaign posters featuring him giving a thumbs-up gesture.
these posters were meant to be a satirical take on the term "african-american," currently used as a culturally sensitive term for black americans, according to one of his campaign managers, scott rambo.
however, the satirical intent backfired, especially as the incident coincided with martin luther king day, a significant holiday honoring the civil rights leader's contributions to the struggle for racial equality.

bradford city made history by defeating aston villa 4-3 on aggregate in the capital one cup semifinals, becoming the first fourth division club to reach a major cup final since 1962.
the memorable moment was made even more special for 9-year-old fan and brain tumor survivor jake turton when bradford's captain, gary jones, located him in the crowd at villa park after the final whistle of the second leg and planted a kiss on his head.
bradford's journey to wembley was incredibly challenging, requiring victories over three premier league clubs - wigan, arsenal, and aston villa.
however, the hardships faced by jake over the last three years, including brain surgery, a 10-week coma, and extensive chemotherapy before being declared tumor-free, truly put their triumph into perspective.

after a decade in office, vietnam's prime minister has resigned, leaving a complex legacy characterized by efforts to revive struggling state enterprises, attracting foreign investment, and bold confrontations with china.
the departure of nguyen tan dung was confirmed in a formal vote by 418 assembly members, representing 84% of the national assembly, who agreed to his dismissal ahead of schedule.
the assembly is poised to elect his deputy, nguyen xuan phuc, as the new prime minister.
dung's exit was precipitated by his defeat in a leadership contest during the communist party's congress, where he was ousted by nguyen phu trong, who retained his post as party general secretary for another term.
the prime minister's removal has highlighted the internal discord within the ruling communist party, with dung facing criticism for the failures of state-owned enterprises, notably the vietnam shipbuilding industry group and vietnam shipping lines, which amassed substantial public debt.
despite his charismatic leadership style and successful international engagements that elevated vietnam's global standing, dung's tenure was marred by controversies surrounding his relationships with wealthy individuals and policy decisions that divided opinion within the party.

in a rare scientific survey commissioned by the wildlife trusts, marine life in porlock bay, somerset, was recently studied by professional divers for the first time in three decades.
the study, conducted by four divers, revealed two distinct sea bed habitats within the bay.
specifically, crustaceans like the long clawed squat lobster were documented in a boulder reef north of gore point in the bristol channel, alongside numerous sponge species.
another site explored was a sand and shell plain located in the center of porlock bay.
during the dives held in early august, sea hares and a rare stalked jellyfish were also discovered, with the latter being a species highlighted in the uk biodiversity action plan, potentially necessitating targeted protection in the future due to its habitat sensitivity.
small samples retrieved by the divers have been meticulously analyzed to classify species types and contribute to a holistic understanding of the biodiversity at each site.
the divers encountered challenges reaching the dive sites due to strong currents affecting visibility on both occasions.
the wildlife trusts expressed astonishment at the diverse species richness found in the area and emphasized the importance of understanding the habitat to facilitate effective conservation efforts going forward.

according to a recent report, the north korean government has relocated around 10,000 households to facilitate the construction of a 270 km segment of highway along the chinese border.
the main objective of this project is to prevent individuals from escaping north korea, as explained by a reliable source.
the highway, stretching from hyesan in ryanggang province to musan in north hamgyong province, is nearing its final stages of completion.

select a player to be the first caller for a round out of the total 26 rounds in the game.
the initial round corresponds to the letter a.
in each round, the designated caller must pick a noun with fewer than four syllables, preferably a tangible object rather than an abstract concept - unless they don't mind receiving playful punches from increasingly tipsy friends.
all participants, including the caller, are then tasked with selecting blocks from the available pool and constructing something that can be identified as the chosen noun.
there isn't a strict criterion for recognition; this aspect is typically determined through general agreement among the players.
the person who constructs the item last earns the responsibility of taking a drink.

the district's decision came after mcmillen was also denied the opportunity to wear a tuxedo, as school policy mandates dates must be of the opposite sex.
although the district's statement did not specifically address mcmillen's situation, officials cited recent distractions as the reason for the cancellation.
they expressed hope that a private citizen would step in to organize a prom event.

in eastern china, a court has handed down prison terms ranging up to six and a half years to three activists associated with a civil rights movement advocating for government officials to openly disclose their assets.
the severity of these sentences, criticized by supporters of the trio as excessive, underscores the communist party's increasingly hard stance against any form of political dissent, irrespective of how peacefully it is expressed or how loosely organized the movement may be.
chinese authorities have been vigilant against any independent social movements that could potentially pose a threat to the party's authority by mobilizing the public, leading to the suppression of the loosely connected new citizens movement to which the three activists belonged.
in the city of xinyu, liu ping, a labor rights advocate, and wei zhongping were each sentenced to six and a half years in prison, while another activist, li sihua, received a three-year sentence, according to their lawyer, zhou ze.
the activists were found guilty of "creating a disturbance," a broadly defined charge increasingly utilized to detain activists.
additionally, liu and wei were convicted on two other charges.
lawyer si weijiang argued that there was no legal justification for the convictions, stating, "the evidence clearly proves their innocence, yet the authorities were resolute in convicting them." surprisingly, liu and wei received longer sentences than the group's founder, xu zhiyong, who was sentenced to four years earlier in the year by a court in beijing.
these prosecutions are part of a broad crackdown on political dissent that has intensified since the previous spring, resulting in the apprehension and imprisonment of numerous activists, intellectuals, human rights attorneys, bloggers, and advocates for marginalized communities.
si remarked that the underlying message being conveyed is that all political dissidents, regardless of guilt or innocence, will be prosecuted and sentenced.
as anticipated and as widely foreseen, isil ignited the mishraq chemical plant and sulphur mine located 30 km south of mosul last thursday while retreating towards the city.
the incident has resulted in the loss of up to nine lives and injuries to approximately 1,000 individuals, including foreign journalists.
the noxious cloud, comprised of toxic sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide, mixed with remnants from burning oil wells, poses a grave danger to those exposed without protective gear.
presently, the hazardous cloud spans 20-30 km to the south across sparsely inhabited areas.
however, if the prevailing wind shifts eastward as per seasonal patterns, there exists a potential risk that the kurdish capital erbil, situated 60 km away, could be endangered.
selecting the appropriate size when considering cooking pots and pans is crucial.
small boiling pots are perfect for preparing meals for a few individuals and are convenient for carrying, especially during lengthy hiking excursions.
conversely, larger boiling pots are ideal for using your grill or smoker to cook ample food for hosting a backyard feast for a large group.
if you prefer durable cookware for outdoor activities, cast-iron is a reliable choice.
aluminum pot kits are versatile and essential for frying poultry or fish, while including a thermometer for monitoring cooking temperatures and a marinade injector for enhancing flavors.
stainless-steel pot kits typically feature a strainer or lifter for easy and safe food removal, reducing splashing from cooking oil.

the pirates have made several roster moves, including adding wilfredo boscan to the active roster while sending cory luebke down to indianapolis.
starling marte has been reinstated from the paternity list, leading to alen hanson being optioned back to indianapolis as anticipated.
in order to make room for boscan, elias diaz has been transferred to the 60-day dl.
despite initial doubts about boscan's potential to impact the team positively, given his history as a reliable pitcher mainly in triple-a, the pirates seem hopeful that his capabilities may shine in a relief role.
luebke's recent underwhelming performance likely contributed to his reassignment, although his stats in triple-a were more notable than boscan's.
it's worth noting that while boscan has been repeatedly promoted without making a major league appearance, this time around, he is expected to finally get his chance to showcase his skills.
valve's ceo, gabe newell, is set to become a fellow of the british academy of film and television arts in recognition of his significant impact on the video game industry.
the formal presentation of the fellowship is scheduled to take place during the bafta video game awards on 5 march.
the academy highlighted valve's role in cultivating a dynamic gaming community through the creation of influential titles like half life, team fortress 2, and dota 2.
newell expressed his gratitude, stating that it was an "honour" for both himself and the entire valve team.
he commended uk players of valve games, the supportive uk press, and acknowledged the contributions of british "modders" such as garry newman.
bafta's video games committee chairman, harvey elliott, lauded mr.
newell's exceptional contributions to the industry, noting that valve's unique approach allows players to not only enjoy games but also engage as creators through accessible tools for modding the studio's creations.
valve's online gaming service, steam, facilitates game purchases and management for many players, while the company is actively developing a steam "box" to enable gaming on tv screens.
past bafta fellows in the video game realm include luminaries like peter molyneux, shigeru miyamoto, and will wright.
in a similar vein, markus persson, the mastermind behind minecraft, was recognized in 2012 with a special award for the unparalleled success of the beloved block-building game.
hailing from milton keynes, liam geddes is an established producer who has been consistently releasing music since 2013 on respected labels like mil, pathway tracks, and love not money.
he now ventures into launching a new imprint called dailycid alongside romanian up-and-comer marius laurentiu.
geddes showcases his signature funky and functional style in tracks like "for the time it took," a sultry vocal house tune characterized by its deep bassline and energetic rhythms that are bound to keep any dancefloor moving.
on the other hand, "ceviche" offers a more relaxed and loungey vibe reminiscent of early cassio productions.
laurentiu makes his mark with the hypnotic and atmospheric "black sea pink sky," a captivating journey that exemplifies the high-quality output that romanian producers are known for, drawing comparisons to established figures like andrei ciubuc and the introspective side of sepp's discography.
a man identified as nourredine h, one of two brothers detained in belgium during an anti-terror operation, has been charged with the offense of attempting to commit "terrorist murder." the 33-year-old individual is also facing allegations of being involved with a terrorist organization.
nourredine h and his brother, hamza h, were apprehended in the mons area and the city of liege following searches conducted on friday.
however, hamza h was subsequently released on saturday without any charges pressed against him.
despite thorough investigations, no weapons or explosives were discovered during the searches.
the organization nourredine h is purportedly affiliated with has not been disclosed by the prosecutors.
since the tragic bombings that claimed 32 lives in brussels in march, belgium has remained on high alert.
the attacks were claimed by the self-proclaimed islamic state.
the federal prosecutor's office mentioned that the ongoing investigation suggests there were plans for potential attacks in belgium.
however, no direct connection to the brussels bombings has been established at this point.
precautionary security measures were heightened in anticipation of belgium's national holiday on 21 july, amid concerns of a similar incident to the tragic lorry attack on bastille day in the french city of nice on 14 july.
recently, democrats and progressives strongly believe that the citizens united supreme court decision has had a detrimental impact on the country comparable to dred scott.
during her concession speech in new hampshire, hillary clinton emphasized the significance of this decision, pointing out that it prevented the banning of a critical documentary about her, an action she felt should have been permissible despite the corporate backing behind it.
clinton expressed her stance on campaign finance reform, emphasizing the need to eliminate undisclosed funding in politics.
she criticized citizens united as one of the most damaging decisions in american history, citing it as a right-wing attack on her campaign that jeopardized democracy.
by personalizing the issue, she argued against what she perceived as an unrestricted expansion of free speech, which she believed had negative repercussions for her.
this underlying theme reflects a broader debate about limiting citizens' ability to voice criticisms through organized structures.
clinton's position advocates for stricter regulations on political speech to prevent attacks on politicians, although this viewpoint may seem somewhat unsettling given the current state of american politics.
walt disney's beloved character dumbo faced ridicule and rejection for his oversized ears, but the true reason behind his unique feature was a mix-up by the baby-delivery stork.
dumbo is actually meant to be an african elephant, known for ears that are twice the size of asian elephants.
by comparing the large ears of an african elephant with the smaller ears of an asian elephant, you can observe the distinctive differences in size and shape resembling the continents they originate from, africa and india.
in the film "dumbo," the stork mistakenly delivers him to the asian elephants in the circus, accentuating the perceived enormity of his ears.
beyond its designation as a children's film, dumbo's story resonates with audiences of all ages, addressing universal themes of overcoming challenges and fears.
for those interested, a recent article in open exchange magazine titled "the magic feather: believing you can succeed" was inspired by the inspirational tale of dumbo.
additionally, a new dvd edition titled "dumbo: big top edition" is set to be released this week, offering viewers the opportunity to revisit this heartwarming classic.
prepare for an emotional journey that may evoke tears of joy, enriching the soul with its touching message.
numerous cats enjoy olives due to the presence of isoprenoids, compounds chemically akin to the active ingredient in catnip.
these isoprenoids are mostly present in pimentos and various types of green olives like kalamatas.
the isoprenoids in olives closely resemble methylcyclopentane monoterpene nepetalactone, the active compound in catnip.
this compound binds to receptors in a cat's vomeronasal organ, where catnip exerts its influence.
cats typically utilize the vomeronasal organ, along with most other animals apart from humans, to detect pheromones.
the pleasing impact on the receptors explains why many cats are fond of both catnip and specific olive varieties.
even typically reserved cats may display unusual behavior, such as vocalizing or pleading, when presented with olives; nonetheless, the pleasurable effects resulting from olive consumption may not affect every cat.
according to cat behaviorist and tv personality jackson galaxy, olives have no adverse impact on cats, despite lacking significant nutritional value for felines.
some pet owners have noticed instances of diarrhea in cats that frequently ingest olives.
while consuming olives occasionally is acceptable, pet radio host tracie hotchner proposes a more stimulating way to treat cats by placing freeze-dried protein treats inside a toy dispenser.
this setup, requiring effort to release the treats, offers cats productive environmental enrichment.
the senior american commander in the pacific, admiral harry harris, disclosed during his visit to sydney that the us is set to deploy its elite fighter aircraft, the f-22 raptor, from northern australia starting next year.
stressing the importance of showcasing strength to discourage aggression in the area, admiral harris affirmed the us's commitment to maintaining a significant role in the region, emphasizing that its strategic interests would persist beyond the upcoming change in presidential leadership on january 20th.
he further announced the formal agreement signed in 2017 for australia to host a range of us military assets, including the highly esteemed raptors, which are recognized globally as superior fighter jets.
this move is expected to assert a powerful statement regarding the us military's influence within the region, a sentiment echoed by admiral harris at the lowy institute event where he expressed optimism about this development.
after its last appearance tethered to offboard hydraulic pumps, the sprinting "cheetah" robot is now set free by boston dynamics in its latest iteration known as wildcat.
in a recent video demonstration, the wildcat showcased impressive abilities, bounding and galloping across level ground at speeds of up to 16mph.
details on the wildcat's power source were initially unclear, sparking concerns about its endurance.
however, boston dynamics later revealed that the wildcat is powered by a 2-stroke go-kart engine directly linked to a hydraulic pump.
currently equipped with a small fuel tank to reduce weight, the wildcat can operate for approximately five minutes before needing a refill.
according to officials, a coptic church building near the libyan city of misrata was targeted in an apparent attack, resulting in the death of two egyptians and injuring two others.
a council official from misrata confirmed to the bbc that the incident occurred during an explosion while the victims were having lunch at the church, located in the small town of dafiniyah.
the culprits behind the blast remain unidentified, and reports conflict on whether it took place on saturday or sunday.
the site of the explosion revealed the presence of home-made dynamite typically used for fishing.
the egyptian government has requested enhanced security measures for the church, with egyptian foreign minister mohammed kamel amr calling for an investigation and accountability for those responsible.
the church in dafiniyah, frequented mainly by egyptian expatriates, serves as a place of worship for the coptic christian community.
despite a small christian population in libya, mainly comprising foreign nationals, including egyptian migrant workers, security challenges persist following the ousting of muammar gaddafi.
recent events, including attacks on diplomatic missions and aid organizations, highlight the ongoing struggle of the libyan government to establish stability and secure its territories.
militant islamists have been implicated in assaults on sufi shrines and mosques, adding to the volatility in the region.
john lee, the chief executive of south sydney, has urgently requested a review of the nrl's recent shoulder charge interpretation.
this call comes as rabbitohs hooker issac luke is set to challenge his charge at the judiciary on wednesday.
luke, who will admit guilt to a dangerous-throw offense, could face a three-game suspension if his challenge is unsuccessful.
however, if he successfully disputes the grade-one shoulder charge related to his collision with north queensland player johnathan thurston, he would only miss the upcoming match against canterbury on friday.
furthermore, souths' luke keary will also be absent from the bulldogs match after accepting guilt for a grade-one shoulder charge against cowboys winger justin o'neill.
these incidents involving the rabbitohs players come after the nrl altered the definition of a shoulder charge, leading to manly's willie mason receiving a two-game ban and sparking concerns over the consistency of the match review committee's decisions.
mauro tassotti, the former ac milan assistant coach, has decided to stay on with the rossoneri as a scout despite earlier indications of departing the club in the summer.
following the dismissal of coach filippo inzaghi in a recent reshuffle at milan, the 55-year-old seemed destined to leave.
however, it now appears that he is continuing his long-standing 35-year association with the club.
premium sport has disclosed that tassotti recently inked a two-year contract with the club specifically to take on the role of a scout.
his responsibilities involve evaluating milan players out on loan to determine their readiness for the first team.
since joining milan in 1980, tassotti has served in various capacities, including player, youth team coach, and more recently as an assistant coach.
in eastern canada, public health officials are cautioning individuals to consider refraining from consuming romaine lettuce due to an e.
coli outbreak, which has resulted in one fatality and 40 illnesses.
the outbreak has seen quebec and newfoundland and labrador reporting 13 cases each, ontario with 8 cases, new brunswick with five cases, and nova scotia with one case.
the public health agency of canada has noted that the e.
coli 0157 cases appear to be linked to romaine lettuce consumption.
the investigation into the outbreak is ongoing, with ten additional cases recently reported.
the demographic of those affected ranges from four to 80 years old, with women constituting 70% of the cases.
the public health agency of canada assures that they will regularly update the public health notice as the investigation progresses.
"that man over there is john burke, the traveler," he explained condescendingly.
burke relies solely on a gun, which is obviously not a tool for writing," remarked fisher.
"when discussing burke and halkett earlier, i mentioned that it's quite challenging to write with a gun.
look at edmund burke, one of the world's wisest individuals and greatest orators.
opinions that might have been doubted if expressed by a native american were considered unquestionably true when articulated by chatham, burke, barre, or fox." dollop inquired about the matter, but the prevailing sentiment among the audience was that her viewpoint served as a defense.
there was a fear that if her opinion was discredited, it might lead to repercussions, as illustrated in the infamous case of burke and hare with their despicable deeds – such gruesome affairs were unwelcome in middlemarch.
goby, whose death was vaguely attributed to a heart condition, took the bold step of seeking permission from her family to conduct an autopsy, inadvertently causing a scandal that spread rapidly beyond parley street where she had long resided.
her association with the crimes committed by burke and hare was perceived as a disrespectful affront to her memory.
nearby was his house perched on a rolling hilltop, offering a panoramic view of lyndon town and beyond, stretching over lush green forests towards the imposing figure of burke mountain.
initially, harry burke earnestly initiated his free money campaign; now, however, he is mooching off his underfed sister for an endless supply of brandies and sodas.
the individual responsible for it lurked in the alleys of edinburgh in disguise, as the crowd that cheered at burke's execution demanded retribution against his employer.
one of the most poignant moments in parliamentary history was the debate where burke and fox parted ways in the house of commons; fox's plea to his old friend based on their longstanding bond moved the entire assembly to tears.

a tragic incident occurred in ukraine's eastern donetsk region where a cameraman for russia's state-owned channel one television lost his life, as reported by the channel.
anatoly klyan, aged 68, was fatally shot in the stomach during an overnight attack on his film crew while they were filming near a pro-kiev military unit in the region.
the trip was arranged by pro-russia rebels, and the crew was accompanying a group of soldiers' mothers intending to meet their sons and bring them home to safety.
the bus carrying the mothers and journalists came under fire as it approached the base, forcing them to retreat.
unfortunately, klyan was fatally injured when they were attacked by a group using automatic rifles after exiting the bus.
the russian government has strongly condemned these killings and urged kiev to halt military operations in donetsk and luhansk regions, where separatists have been occupying state facilities and weapon storages.
this tragic event adds to a series of lethal attacks on russian journalists, including the recent deaths of a correspondent and a sound engineer near luhansk due to mortar fire.
the escalation of violence in eastern ukraine persists despite president petro poroshenko's ceasefire declared on june 20, set to expire on monday at 1900gmt.

calls are being made for israeli authorities to close the online account of an activist residing in the country, accused of harassing french journalists.
this activist, gregory chelli, claims the reporters are biased in favor of palestinians.
following a hoax call from chelli, the father of a journalist passed away due to heart failure.
chelli vehemently denied any involvement in the death.
he stated that the call occurred five days before the journalist's father died and expressed intentions to pursue legal action against media outlets spreading these accusations.
known as ulcan, chelli has faced allegations of cyber intrusions into pro-palestinian websites during the gaza conflict this year, leading to retaliation from french journalists.
the situation escalated when chelli reportedly called the journalist's father posing as the police, falsely claiming the son's demise.
another incident involved chelli impersonating the journalist's father and alerting the police of a fabricated murder.
subsequently, the father suffered a fatal heart attack.
while french authorities would have shut down chelli's online operations earlier, he is exploiting israel's hesitance to act upon french legal pressures.
the increasing presence of dockless bicycles in sydney and melbourne has been drawing attention, with reports of some being vandalized and abandoned.
however, the primary issue lies not in the growing number of these distinctive red and yellow bicycles, but rather in the reactionary response from councils that leans towards a "lock-them-up" mentality.
several sydney councils have proposed restricting these share bikes to designated parking spots, fining operators, and advocating for state government intervention.
such measures are viewed as counterproductive as they undermine the flexibility and convenience that define bike-sharing networks.
this knee-jerk reaction reflects a broader resistance to innovative transportation solutions that has perpetuated car dependency in our cities.
dockless bike sharing represents a radical shift towards enhanced mobility.
the essence of its appeal lies in the freedom it offers, particularly in reducing reliance on car ownership.
the unparalleled convenience of riding a bike directly to your destination not only fosters a sense of liberation but also has the potential to reshape commuting behaviors.
this liberating experience contrasts sharply with traditional bike-sharing systems that require docking stations.
the struggles faced by melbourne's bicycle-sharing initiative serve as a cautionary tale, highlighting the importance of preserving the spontaneity and flexibility that bikes provide.
instead of stifling this revolutionary and joyful mode of transportation by imposing strict regulations and designated areas, councils should focus on cultivating an environment conducive to its success.
according to the swedish public service broadcaster, the boy's mother made the decision to join a terror group in 2015, leading to the family relocating to syria.
a report by svt featured images from the mother's facebook page showing her three-year-old son posing with firearms.
the family reportedly possessed various weapons in their syrian residence, including kalashnikov rifles and grenades.
tragically, the boy is believed to have lost his life due to an accidental explosion involving a grenade at their home.
his older sibling sustained injuries from shrapnel when the grenade detonated nearby.
this incident marks the first recorded case of a swedish child's death after their parents departed the country to affiliate with isis, as stated by svt.
despite this information, sweden's foreign ministry could not verify the child's death due to the challenging nature of obtaining confirmed details in syria.
veronica nordlund, a press spokesperson for the foreign ministry, explained to svt that the situation in syria complicates the confirmation process.
in response to these occurrences, sweden recently enacted stricter legislation aimed at penalizing individuals involved in traveling abroad to join terrorist organizations.
under the enhanced laws, those found guilty of seeking training or planning terrorist activities overseas may face a two-year prison sentence.
according to officials, a car bomb explosion outside a police base in ismailiya, egypt, resulted in the death of a police officer and injuries to at least 35 individuals.
after the blast, intense gunfire was heard in the vicinity of the base.
ismailiya and its surrounding regions have been frequent targets of attacks by islamist militants on security personnel.
the military has been engaged in a widespread operation against militants in the neighboring sinai peninsula, which has experienced escalating instability since the ousting of president hosni mubarak.
following his removal in february 2011, the northern sinai became susceptible to jihadist groups, some of which have ties to the gaza strip.
in response to the escalating violence, security forces initiated an offensive against islamist militants in the sinai in september, yet they have faced a series of deadly bombings.
over the past few months, around 100 security force members have lost their lives in these attacks.
in a separate incident last month, a car bomb targeting a convoy of soldiers near el-arish resulted in the deaths of 11 soldiers.
an early review in the upcoming april issue of edge magazine reveals that from software's dark and macabre bloodborne offers a gameplay experience lasting over 40 hours.
the publication took even longer to complete a full playthrough, indicating that the game is expected to be exceptionally content-rich.
aside from the extensive single-player content, the game boasts various online features such as co-op, pvp, and the randomly generated chalice dungeons, promising an immersive gaming experience.
the magazine also discusses the customization of weapons using bloodgems and provides insights from an interview with the game's director, hidetaka miyazaki.
bloodborne is slated for an exclusive release on playstation 4 on 25th march in north america and 28th march in europe, offering a substantial and engaging gameplay experience for players.
in india, fifteen muslim men were arrested for allegedly chanting "anti-india and pro-pakistan" slogans during the champions trophy cricket final.
they were detained in madhya pradesh and denied bail after being accused of sedition.
according to reports, the men were apprehended following complaints from their hindu neighbors, who claimed they had set off firecrackers and voiced support for pakistan during the match, which pakistan eventually won by a margin of 180 runs.
sedition, a grave offense under indian law, implies restrictions such as surrendering passports, ineligibility for government employment, mandatory court appearances, and financial burdens on legal representation.
despite statements from police indicating that the arrests were due to the anti-india slogans and not merely supporting pakistan, there have been past instances of indian muslims facing repercussions for backing the pakistan cricket team.
for instance, in 2014, 66 muslim students from indian-administered kashmir were expelled from their university in uttar pradesh for allegedly disrupting communal harmony, while in 2016, conflicts at a university in indian-administered kashmir prompted police intervention following clashes involving students from different parts of the country.
transport minister robert goodwill has revealed that the supposed drone incident involving a british airways jet may have been a plastic bag.
it has not been confirmed yet whether the object that struck the aircraft was actually a remote-controlled drone.
the collision occurred at an altitude of approximately 1,700 ft near richmond park in southwest london, surpassing the legal height limit by more than four times.
the air accidents investigation branch and the metropolitan police are conducting an investigation into the incident.
goodwill has rejected calls for stricter regulations on drone use to guard against potential terror threats, stating that existing regulations are sufficient.
according to him, it would be more feasible for terrorists to launch attacks on airports using conventional means such as rucksacks or car bombs rather than through drones.
furthermore, he expressed doubts about the effectiveness of mandating all drone manufacturers to include geo-fencing technology that prevents drones from entering restricted airspace, warning that such measures could be circumvented by hackers.
according to internal government records, top global weapons manufacturers and arms dealers have entertained defense executives and military officers.
these records reveal the close ties between the defense industry giants and military personnel, with over 110 complimentary meals, tickets to theatre and football games offered to the defense department's high-ranking three-star officials by various companies in the last three years.
vice-admiral matt tripovich, the former head of the chief capability development group, emerged as the most frequent beneficiary, participating in nearly a quarter of all such events attended by senior figures in the australian defense hierarchy.
admiral tripovich, who played a crucial role in securing approval for the purchase of new multimillion-dollar weapon systems, was treated to 28 invitations for dinners, concerts, theatre performances, and rugby matches.
communal tension was reported in kanpur, uttar pradesh, when hindu groups took to the streets on saturday following the discovery of ripped posters and banners of bhagwati jagran in a local area.
the police confirmed that some jagran posters were found torn in the babupurwa locality late friday night, leading to protests in various parts of the city the next day.
the demonstrators demanded accountability for the vandalism, resulting in road blockages and clashes during a muslims' tazia procession.
stones were thrown, property was vandalized, and a few individuals were injured, prompting the district administration to impose prohibitory orders and increase security measures.
a home department official noted that while the situation was tense, it remained under control.
the bjp state unit criticized the samajwadi party-led government for its perceived failure to uphold communal harmony, citing recent outbreaks of violence in various regions.
consequently, heightened security measures were put in place across the state in response to escalating communal tensions in several areas.
incidents of violence had previously been reported in banda, ambedkarnagar, kannauj, and fatehpur following communal clashes.

according to the revelations in american journalist glenn greenwald's latest book "no place to hide," australia's electronic espionage agency enlisted the support of american intelligence operatives to surveil australian citizens suspected of terrorist affiliations.
based on leaked documents from former us intelligence contractor edward snowden, it was disclosed that in 2011, the australian signals directorate made a direct plea to the us national security agency to expand their collaboration and intensify surveillance on australian individuals.
greenwald's book sheds further light on australia's covert partnership with the united states in intelligence operations.
the declassified records also demonstrate joint efforts between the australian signals directorate and the national security agency, leading to the apprehension of a perpetrator involved in the 2002 bali bombings.
an official letter dated february 2011, detailed in greenwald's publication, shows the then acting director of the australian signals directorate reaching out to the national security agency for assistance in monitoring the communications of both local and overseas-based terrorist elements within australia.

the article delves into the exploration of equestrian rockers, a popular toy iconography.
from the innovative design perspective of simon evrard, "my rocking horse" seeks to reimagine the traditional rocking horse in a practical and visually appealing manner.
evrard's approach involves maintaining the iconic silhouette of the toy while showcasing a unique assembly of separate components that deviate from the conventional symbolic shape.
initially experimenting with layered wooden panels to mimic the original form, evrard also ventures into using molded aluminum tubes to create a distinctive, unrecognizable appearance from the front, adding a touch of contemporary creativity to the classic design.
dc power lines are effective at transporting electricity over long distances, including underwater, surpassing the capabilities of traditional ac lines commonly found in transmission grids.
the preference for ac transmission has persisted for decades due to limitations in using high-voltage dc for building interconnected grid networks essential for a stable electricity system.
however, abb, a swiss conglomerate, has overcome this obstacle by introducing a breakthrough high-voltage dc circuit breaker.
this innovation allows for isolating grid sections experiencing issues while enabling the unaffected parts to continue functioning, paving the way for the implementation of extensive dc grid systems.
such grids would notably enhance the connection of renewable energy sources situated far apart, enabling power utilities to balance out fluctuations in wind and solar energy.
for instance, solar power generated in sunny regions like the sahara could be transmitted to overcast areas like germany, and wind energy from various parts of europe could sustain electricity needs during nighttime.
this advancement promises a more reliable renewable energy infrastructure capable of competing with conventional fossil fuels.

recent studies on the selection of financial advisers reveal that many individuals struggle to differentiate between a competent and an incompetent adviser.
they face challenges in distinguishing between sound advice and poor advice, particularly when dealing with complex issues, and often tend to retain an adviser even when the quality of advice provided is subpar.
the research conducted by susan thorp, a finance and superannuation professor at the university of technology, sydney, along with her colleagues, sheds light on the shortcomings in individuals' ability to assess the quality of advice received and the reasons behind their loyalty to underperforming advisers.
the study indicates that people have difficulty distinguishing between authentic and counterfeit qualifications.
these findings underscore the significance of robust consumer protection measures, especially in the context of potential adjustments to the labor's future of financial advice reforms by the coalition government.
the reforms were introduced following a series of missteps that led to retirees losing their savings due to advisers being swayed by commissions.
while the government argues that the proposed amendments aim to streamline processes and reduce costs for financial firms, ultimately making advice more affordable for consumers, critics argue that the amendments primarily serve to appease the banks and insurers, with whom many advisers are aligned.
they posit that these changes may undermine consumer safeguards.

in the opening race, he maintained his lead from pole position and triumphed by a notable four-second margin over lloyd, who managed to recover from a two-place grid penalty carried over from the previous sandown round.
lloyd's impressive advance from fourth on the grid was marked by a bold first lap maneuver overtaking tom grech and jimmy vernon despite slight contact.
randle had established a significant lead of over two seconds by the end of the initial lap, which he increased over the subsequent 14 laps.
the podium was completed by lloyd and vernon, with grech finishing fourth after switching to a different chassis due to a damaged car from a practice crash.

this announcement followed reports of the arrest of one of the church's elders who is a suspect in the sexual assault case of a minor.
the elder from a st mary church was taken into custody on wednesday night by the centre for the investigation of sexual offences and child abuse after an official report was lodged.
pastor brown emphasized the importance of adhering to the church's high moral and ethical standards and urged all members and workers to cooperate fully with the authorities in the ongoing investigations.

francesca stavrakopoulou challenges the conventional interpretation of the garden of eden and ventures to what she believes is its precise historical location.
delving into the question of the garden of eden's existence, esteemed bible scholar dr.
francesca stavrakopoulou asserts a unique perspective.
in the culmination of her series that reevaluates traditional biblical interpretations, she posits that the garden of eden is not a narrative about the beginnings of humanity but rather a tale containing significant events concerning a specific individual in a specific place roughly two and a half millennia ago.
through a thorough examination of archaeological findings, islamic sources, and biblical texts, she pinpoints and personally visits the alleged site of eden.
this groundbreaking hypothesis challenges deeply ingrained beliefs about eden across both christian theology and western civilization.
in a span of slightly more than a year, glenn beck's meteoric rise to fame at fox news has often overshadowed the network itself, causing concern among many of its employees.
despite his time cover story, best-selling books, prominent role in protest rallies, and controversial statements, beck's popularity has led to impressive ratings.
however, there is a noticeable divide within fox, with chairman roger ailes and his supporters approving of beck's approach, while many journalists fear that beck is becoming the predominant face of the network.
beck's outspoken remarks, such as referring to president obama as a racist and denouncing progressivism as a "cancer," have made him a lightning rod figure, creating a unique situation at rupert murdoch's network.
this situation has also complicated fox's efforts to refute criticisms from the white house about its news credibility.
with beck often criticized by fox journalists for using provocative language that undermines their journalistic integrity, he remains a significant topic of discussion within the network.

this triumph grants them direct qualification for the next season's champions league group stage.

according to the courier-journal, karey cooper, a social worker in boone county, may face repercussions from the state cabinet for health and family services for her involvement with the child, as the case had been previously closed by another worker.

during thursday's european elections, a romanian dentist running for mep with the europeans party in london spoke out against nigel farage, suggesting he should face legal action for remarks targeting his compatriots.
tommy tomescu expressed his motivation for candidacy stemmed from what he perceived as unfair criticisms directed at romanians, poles, bulgarians, slovaks, and other eastern and central europeans.
he condemned farage, as well as the tories and labour, for their statements on immigration, arguing that xenophobic sentiments were gaining ground.
in an interview with adam fleming on the daily politics, tomescu was joined by former ukip mep nikki sinclaire, a candidate for the we demand a referendum now party.
tomescu asserted that farage should not be immune to legal repercussions just because other parties feared losing votes, referencing farage's defense of his contentious remarks regarding the integration of romanian individuals into society.

since i traveled almost 4000 miles, i made sure to explore the city during my trip.
similar to cities like new york and london, chicago is adorned with various protest stickers, offering insight into the prevalent social movements and subversive political campaigns resonating within the city.

in beijing, jang song-thaek was widely recognized by north koreans as the second most prominent figure in their country, esteemed as the uncle and mentor of kim jong-un, the supreme leader.
however, a televised scene showed mr jang being escorted from a ruling party meeting by two guards in green uniforms, as he stood despondently accused of faction-building, womanizing, gambling, and other transgressions, in front of numerous former associates.
this public display of mr jang's disgraceful removal and subsequent arrest, along with his erasure from official publications and propaganda materials, provided an unusual glimpse into an internal power struggle unfolding within north korea.
the repercussions of this event reverberate beyond the country's borders, particularly raising concerns in china.
china has historically maintained a close relationship with north korea as a key element in its foreign policy and a buffer against the us military presence in south korea.
the unexpected downfall of mr jang, a figure china had trusted to oversee kim jong-un, a leader much younger than him, has the potential to destabilize the political dynamics in asia.
while there are no signs of a shift in china's stance towards north korea, the swift and surprising developments surrounding mr jang's dismissal have left even beijing's top echelons startled, especially with the televised announcement made by north korean state media.
virtual reality is a technology that defies simple explanation; it must be experienced firsthand to truly grasp its capabilities.
samsung's advertisement for the gear vr attempts to showcase this immersive experience through clever techniques but reveals the challenge of captivating the interest of the average consumer with vr.
while the gear vr represents impressive technology, further refinement is necessary before it can reach mainstream appeal, mirroring the advertising's limited success in conveying the sensation of virtual reality.
the absence of gameplay footage and the difficulty in simulating the sensation of soaring above a city are highlighted, emphasizing the disconnect between the actual experience and its representation.
overall, the advertisement's attempt to convey the essence of virtual reality is admirable yet results in a somewhat awkward and strained portrayal.
i was acquainted with the climber who tragically passed away.
although i was not present at the scene, i understand that the accident occurred on the first pitch of the yellow wall.
having successfully followed the route the previous week without any complications, she aspired to lead it this time.
unfortunately, about 20 feet up and before placing any gear, her foot slipped, causing a fatal fall.
her climbing partner acted swiftly but, regrettably, she remained unconscious.
i'd like to respectfully request refraining from any speculation or criticism regarding what she could have done differently.
she was a vibrant and compassionate individual with a profound love for climbing.
hailing from chile, she had extensive climbing experience in cochamo, patagonia, as well as various locations across the us, including her recent ventures in denver.
her absence will be deeply felt by many.
may she rest in peace, and my heartfelt condolences go out to her family in chile.
the un high commissioner for human rights, navi pillay, has expressed deep concerns regarding the challenges faced by religious minorities in indonesia.
pillay has urged indonesia to decisively address the violence against religious minorities.
during a recent visit to the country, she met with representatives from the christian, ahmadiyya, and shia communities.
in a documented report by barnabas fund, pillay shared her distress at learning about the violent attacks, forced displacements, and discriminatory practices such as the denial of identification cards experienced by these groups.
she highlighted the inadequate protection provided by the police in these cases and emphasized the need for action.
particularly troubling to pillay was the arbitrary and discriminatory implementation of sharia law in aceh, where individuals have faced severe punishments like stoning and caning.
reports have emerged of forced closures of churches, even those with legal permits, such as the gki yasmin church in bogor and the hkbp filadelfia church in bekasi.
despite court rulings in favor of keeping these churches open, they were shut down by local authorities under pressure from extremists.
the congregations have been holding open-air services, which have also been disrupted by harassment from local muslim groups.
acts of violence towards the filadelfia congregation, including the throwing of noxious substances, have been reported.
pillay stressed that the raids on congregation gatherings have created an atmosphere of fear and intimidation, urging the indonesian government to combat radical interpretations of islam and ensure that their commitments to international human rights treaties are translated into domestic laws.
the european union has recently lifted additional sanctions against various top officials and entities in zimbabwe.
an eu representative disclosed that the bloc has removed restrictions on 20 entities and 51 individuals, including the justice and foreign ministers.
nevertheless, sanctions against president robert mugabe persist.
last year, the eu lifted 35 sanctions, recognizing the strides made by the power-sharing government in alleviating the country's economic challenges.
despite these developments, president mugabe and over 100 key associates are still under restrictive measures, such as asset freezes and travel bans to european nations.
the eu has expressed reservations about the fulfillment of commitments made following the tumultuous 2008 elections, particularly in reforms concerning the police and security services.
notably, the travel bans on justice minister patrick chinamasa and foreign minister simbarashe mumbengegwi were lifted to facilitate their visit to brussels for discussions, even though their assets remain frozen.
meanwhile, human rights watch, a us-based advocacy group, urged the eu to maintain its sanctions, citing ongoing arrests of peaceful dissenters.
the group cautioned against sending the wrong message to the zimbabwean government by lifting the sanctions prematurely.
the modern harkavy residence, located in potomac, maryland, usa, was designed by american architect robert gurney.
spanning 2,900 square feet, the residence is situated amidst a forested setting.
as described by the architects, the entrance experience is carefully curated with a series of walls that create a sense of privacy and guide visitors into the house.
the design elements, including the walls, garage volume, and house itself, serve as a transitional space between the road and the surrounding wooded area.
the house features three distinct volumes with varied roof forms, with a prominent two-story wood volume anchoring the overall composition.
a butterfly-shaped roof not only offers views to the south but also efficiently directs rainwater into a collection system.
through its simplistic design and use of tactile materials, the house harmoniously blends into the natural landscape, allowing residents to witness the changing seasons and the local wildlife.
the project prompts readers to ponder the incorporation of more nature-inspired architectural projects on freshome.
although i typically shy away from shooter games, this particular title stands out from the rest.
developed by naughty dog, renowned for setting industry standards with their games, the last of us surpassed my expectations.
originally experiencing the game on the ps3, i was captivated by its premise.
upon its remastered release on the ps4, i couldn't resist giving it a go.
set in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by a deadly fungus outbreak wiping out most of civilization over the past two decades, survivors have sought refuge in militarized safe zones.
the narrative follows joel, the main protagonist, on a mission to smuggle a young girl out of the city, their journey unveiling a riveting tale.
the encounters with diverse characters along the way left a lasting impression unlike any other game i've played.
joel and the girl forge a profound father-daughter bond that lingers in the player's memory long after completing the game.
the remastered edition, featuring the left behind dlc, offers an enhanced experience.
rarely do dlcs justify purchasing, yet left behind presents a poignant backstory of ellie before her encounter with joel.
the dlc also introduces fresh gameplay tactics absent in the original version.
in summary, this remastered release is a must-have, even for those who have already delved into the game.

as the children progressed in age, the researchers conducted multiple assessments to uncover potential environmental influences on their development.
on a positive note, they discovered that children raised in a nurturing environment - indicated by caregiver warmth, affection, and language stimulation - exhibited better development compared to those in less nurturing settings.

those who experienced high levels of violence were more prone to displaying symptoms of depression and anxiety, alongside lower self-esteem.

according to a conservative iranian newspaper, the primary opposition leader in the country should face trial for inciting unrest following the controversial presidential elections in june.
the kayhan daily published an editorial insisting that mir hossein mousavi, whom they labeled a us agent, must be prosecuted for "treason".
the post-election street demonstrations, which mr.
mousavi alleges were manipulated, have unveiled a division within iran's ruling body.
additionally, reports indicate that a uk embassy employee held in tehran is facing charges related to the protests.
the uk foreign office is reportedly looking into claims by the guardian newspaper that the embassy's principal political analyst is being accused of activities deemed detrimental to national security.
mousavi for various offenses, including instigating violence, colluding with foreign entities, and orchestrating chaos, and proposed that he and former reformist president mohammad khatami should be held accountable for these alleged violations.
the newspaper, overseen by ayatollah ali khamenei, the supreme leader of iran, claims to possess concrete evidence linking mr.
the basij, iran's government-affiliated militia, has also demanded the prosecution of mr.
mousavi has not publicly commented on these accusations, he, along with another defeated opposition contender, mehdi karoubi, maintain that any government led by president ahmadinejad is not legitimate due to alleged electoral fraud during the june 12th elections.
a coroner's investigation unveiled compelling evidence indicating that a female police officer mistakenly discharged her firearm instead of her taser, resulting in the shooting of a mentally disturbed man from behind in 2009.
the incident occurred when adam salter was fatally shot in his kitchen in lakemba after authorities were summoned to reports of him self-harming with a knife.
the officer involved, sergeant sheree bissett, and nsw police officials argued that salter posed a threat to another officer with a knife, justifying the use of lethal force.
however, during the inquiry into the tragedy, it emerged that sergeant bissett had vocally indicated her intention to use her taser before firing her gun, leading deputy state coroner scott mitchell to conclude that it was likely a tragic case of mistaken weapon use.
indonesian authorities have indicated that a fuel tanker that went missing from a malaysian port was likely commandeered by its own crew following a dispute with their employer.
the vessel, named vier harmoni and laden with 900,000 liters of diesel, reappeared in indonesian waters after losing contact on tuesday evening, and malaysian and indonesian maritime forces are currently conducting a search.
reports of hijacking, initially circulated by various news outlets, have been dismissed by authorities.
the ship's captain reportedly conveyed to the employer their decision to return the vessel to the indonesian island of batam due to internal management issues.
according to al jazeera's step vaessen, who is reporting from jakarta, the crew's actions are viewed as a symptom of an internal disagreement rather than a hijacking or piracy attempt.
the crew members, comprised of indonesians on an indonesian vessel chartered by a malaysian company, have apparently taken this step due to non-payment for over a month.
this incident occurs against a backdrop of frequent raids by armed thieves on small tankers in southeast asia, aiming to pilfer marine diesel and oil for illegal trade.
the vier harmoni had departed from tanjung pelepas port in malaysia on monday, with similarities drawn to a past hijacking incident involving the orkim victory, a malaysian tanker, last year.
port adelaide is strongly positioned to potentially increase its afl premiership count this season.
the club is set to request the afl to recognize its 34 sanfl flags by revising the premierships table.
recent reports from fairfax media suggest that the afl is contemplating various proposals that may establish the official history of the competition to 1870, aligning with the year melbourne secured the first recorded premiership.
port adelaide's ceo, keith thomas, has made the case that if historical adjustments are to be implemented, the club's 34 state league premierships from before it joined the afl in 1997 should also be accounted for.
this move could elevate carlton to the lead in the overall premiership tally with 22 victories and grant geelong an additional seven flags.
during an election rally, pm manmohan singh stated that the upa government's policies aimed at rapid and inclusive growth have yielded positive outcomes, resulting in a record average economic growth over the past nine years.
he emphasized that the economic growth rate achieved during this period surpasses that of any other decade in indian history.
singh highlighted that under the upa rule since 2004, the rate of poverty reduction has been three times higher compared to the previous decade.
he also noted that rural consumption has significantly increased, leading to improved living standards and extended average lifespans by five years.
the government's efforts to promote transparency, reduce corruption, and enhance accountability have been significant, showcasing landmark achievements such as the right to education, the food security bill, and the nrega program.
furthermore, singh mentioned the enactment of legislation to grant ownership rights to tribal communities over lands they have inhabited for centuries as a pivotal step towards their development.
vladislav surkov, the first deputy administration chief under president dmitry medvedev, expressed his belief that vladimir putin's leadership in russia was destined by fate and the divine during a television interview in chechnya, as reported by the interfax news agency.
surkov has been closely associated with putin since the latter's initial presidency in 2000 and is recognized as one of his most trusted associates.
with putin now serving as prime minister and the upcoming presidential elections in march looming, both putin and medvedev have yet to disclose their candidacy plans.
despite this uncertainty, putin remains highly regarded by the public and has even garnered some unusual displays of admiration, such as a small female group proclaiming him as the reincarnation of paul the apostle, as per russian media reports in may.
according to reports, a syrian army general has defected to the opposition, attributing the collapse of morale within the army as his reason.
in a video broadcasted on al-arabiya tv, general mohammed ezz al-din khalouf, identified by opposition activists, announced his defection and is reported to have safely reached jordan.
no response has been issued from the syrian government.
human rights watch, based in new york, has once again accused the government of deploying cluster bombs against civilians.
approximately 70,000 individuals have lost their lives, and one million have fled syria since the start of the uprising against president bashar al-assad two years ago.
in the video appearance, gen khalouf, referred to as both a brigadier-general and a major-general, was seen seated alongside his son, who is identified as an army captain.
he expressed his views on the regime in the video, stating, "it is not possible for anyone to accept any of the ideas of this regime unless they have achieved special interests." an activist from a rebel faction, seif al-hourani, disclosed via skype to ap news agency that the evasion had been strategically planned over several months, culminating in the successful passage of the general, his wife, and three children to jordan with rebel assistance.
if validated, this defection would mark one of the highest-ranking officials to defect since the conflict began.
cluster bombs, which disperse smaller bomblets upon deployment, present a prolonged hazard to civilians, as many don't detonate immediately.
the use of cluster bombs has been banned by most nations.
human rights watch highlighted syria's escalating employment of cluster munitions as documented in a report, citing 150 attacks over six months.
despite previous denials by the syrian army in october that they were employing cluster bombs, reports indicate otherwise.
the nrl is considering implementing a third on-field referee in 2016, marking a significant proposed alteration to the game comparable to the introduction of the video referee.
the organization has enlisted the expertise of former australian cricket coach john buchanan and league immortal bob fulton to conduct a comprehensive review of the referee corps.
a key aspect of their examination involves a potential trial of a video referee bunker by the middle of the following season to enhance the uniformity of officiating.
modeled after the nhl and the nba, the proposed "central command center" would be located off-site, with the aim of expediting the match review process so coaches could receive charge sheets promptly, possibly even before post-game press conferences.
nrl head of football todd greenberg indicated that coaches might eventually be able to accept charges in real time, enabling them to make strategic decisions during press conferences.
greenberg expressed confidence that the new system could be realistically implemented by the 2016 season, with the expected cost to the league being substantial.
in fall river, a simple disagreement over the proper care of reptiles at jurassic jungle pet store took a disturbing turn that resulted in a physical altercation, leading to two arrests and three individuals being hospitalized.
brothers james dugan-weeks, 27, and allen weeks, 30, appeared in fall river district court, entering pleas of not guilty to a list of charges including kidnapping, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, assault and battery, and strangulation in the case of dugan-weeks.
according to reports by the herald news, the incident began after an argument ensued between dugan-weeks, a volunteer at jurassic jungle, and a customer over reptile care.
the situation escalated when dugan-weeks allegedly choked the customer against a wall, with weeks joining in.
subsequently, when two other individuals attempted to step in, the brothers reportedly locked the store, proceeding to assault all three individuals.
the altercation spilled outside the store before the brothers fled the scene, only to be apprehended later that day.
an attorney for weeks, rene brown, mentioned a different account of the events, claiming her client was hit in the head with a brick and had to seek emergency medical treatment.
further proceedings regarding the potential release of the two men will take place on thursday.
in a significant development, canberra is edging closer to producing its inaugural legal cannabis plants as the act government commends the federal government for bridging the gap in supplying medicinal cannabis.
greens minister shane rattenbury has announced plans to propose a bill to establish an act program for growing and distributing medicinal cannabis following an announcement by federal health minister sussan ley, who revealed that modifications to the narcotics drugs act were in the finalization stages.
under the proposed changes, the department of health will have the authority to issue licenses to growers within a new framework, with responsibilities and regulations for states and territories.
rattenbury, who spearheaded the drafting of the legislation prompting an assembly review earlier this year, emphasized the swiftness with which public opinion on the matter has evolved.
he noted, "historically, federal regulations have posed a barrier to act's establishment of a formal mechanism for cultivating and supplying medicinal cannabis." john, a co-founder of techworld, has extensive experience in editing various technology publications such as network world, network week, and lan magazine.
according to a report by a spanish newspaper, a tragic plane crash in 2008 that claimed the lives of 154 individuals may have been partly caused by malware infecting a crucial ground safety system.
the ill-fated spanair flight was en route from madrid to the canary islands on august 20, 2008, but tragically crashed before clearing the runway, resulting in the loss of all but 18 of the 172 passengers and aircrew on board.
while the exact cause of the crash remains disputed, investigators suggest that it was linked to the md-82 aircraft not having its flaps properly positioned before takeoff.
investigators also noted that the pilots failed to correctly set the flaps on two occasions, a discrepancy that should have been caught by a ground system utilized by the airline to alert to such errors.
however, on the day of the crash, the system reportedly malfunctioned due to an undisclosed malware infestation, as reported by el pais.
if verified, this incident would mark the first recorded instance of malware having a direct connection to fatalities.
it is worth noting that in situations where critical safety systems are compromised, human intervention is crucial to ensure oversight.
while infections of critical systems by malware are rare, there have been previous instances reported, such as a computer worm infecting laptops on the international space station in 2008 after being introduced by a member of the russian crew.
in a groundbreaking ruling on monday, two men were convicted of polygamy in canada, upholding the country's enduring ban on the practice.
winston blackmore, who has 25 wives and 146 children, and james marion oler, with five wives, face potential prison sentences of up to five years following the verdict, marking the first decisive test of canada's 127-year-old polygamy law.
despite a hesitation to prosecute due to concerns about violating canadians' constitutional rights to religious freedom, the path to charges was eventually paved in 2011 when british columbia province's supreme court determined that the negative effects of polygamy warranted limitations on religious liberties.
this ruling emboldened authorities to press charges against blackmore and oler three years later, after three special prosecutors had previously considered but refrained from pursuing the case.
martin tremblay, the minor hockey coach responsible for tripping two players from the opposing team during post-game handshakes following a spring-league game at ubc last june, has been sentenced to 15 days in jail.
the incident, captured on video, went viral and has accumulated over two million views.
tremblay faced assault charges and admitted guilt in provincial court in richmond in november.
witnesses reported that the 48-year-old aggressively passed through the post-game handshake line, deliberately causing two richmond steel players to fall by extending his right foot, resulting in one player sustaining a wrist injury.
additionally, video evidence showed tremblay making an obscene gesture towards spectators at the match.
as a consequence of his actions, he has been suspended from coaching duties by the vancouver minor hockey association.

in karachi, a shaheen air international flight, nl901, experienced a tyre burst during take-off from islamabad and was forced to make an emergency landing at quaid-e-azam international airport.
the flight, en route to manchester with approximately 150 passengers and crew on board, circled the airport until the runway was cleared by emergency services and air traffic control.
following a safe emergency landing, all passengers and crew were confirmed to be unharmed.
this incident follows a similar one in november when a domestic shaheen air international flight had a tyre burst during an emergency landing at allama iqbal international airport, resulting in injuries to 10 passengers and damage to the aircraft's fuselage due to faulty landing gear.
valentino rossi, the nine-time world champion, has fractured his leg in a training accident earlier today, re-injuring the same leg he had broken in 2010 during an enduro ride with the members of his vr46 academy.
the movistar yamaha racer has reportedly sustained fractures in both his tibia and fibula from the fall and is scheduled to undergo surgery this evening to address the injury.
this incident marks the second time this year that rossi has been injured in a training mishap, following his rib injuries prior to the italian grand prix in may, which had necessitated a hospital stay.
the confirmation of the fractured leg could pose a more severe setback for rossi, potentially disrupting his chances of contending for a tenth world championship in 2017, especially as he currently trails championship leader andrea dovizioso by just 26 points after twelve rounds.
several months earlier, a consortium of qatari investors acquired a substantial portfolio of greek commercial properties valued at 125 million euros, which included a cluster of five to six expansive retail spaces situated in prominent greek cities.
george mantzavinatos, the managing partner at doha properties wll, disclosed that his firm facilitated these acquisitions on behalf of the qatari investors by identifying and consolidating the properties with the approval of their previous owners.
notably, the properties were purchased by private qatari investors rather than a state-backed fund or a member of the qatari royal family.
additionally, doha properties was involved in the bidding process for the astir palace resort in vouliagmeni, serving as advisors to potential investors from the middle east.
mantzavinatos emphasized the keen interest of arab investors in the greek market and its abundant investment prospects.
he highlighted their preference for discreet transactions and pointed out that qatari investors favor properties located in strategic regions with significant energy and geopolitical importance, such as greece.
the escalating political turmoil and unrest in countries like egypt, syria, iran, and iraq have prompted arab investors to shift their focus towards the stability of the greek market.
particularly, they are drawn to ventures in tourism infrastructure and commercial complexes.
the recent investment in the astir palace by the arab-owned jermyn street real estate fund is poised to further enhance greece's allure as an investment destination for individuals from the arab world.
bbc sport has reported that wayne rooney, the striker for manchester united, has accepted a fine for his subpar training performance following a night out.
rooney and his wife dined with teammates darron gibson and jonny evans on boxing day.
despite behaving appropriately during the meal, their training the next day disappointed their manager, sir alex ferguson.
as a result, rooney was fined one week's wages and has respected the decision.
the striker, who was omitted from the lineup for united's loss to blackburn, is eager to move forward and return to the field.
both evans and gibson were also penalized and excluded from the new year's eve match.
notably, all three players were treated equally in the matter.
a source from manchester united revealed to the bbc that the issue is considered resolved and there is no lingering animosity.
additionally, ferguson arranged for rooney, evans, and gibson to come in for training on a scheduled day off as part of their punishment.
manchester united will face newcastle at the sports direct arena next.

however, the upcoming lumia black update will bring more subtle changes.
the main focus of the black update is on improving the glance feature of lumia devices, set to be released in the near future.
during a session at nokia world in abu dhabi, nokia revealed that the update will introduce image background support and a variety of colors for the sleep mode of the glance feature.
additionally, nokia will integrate notification support for lockscreen notifications.
a notable addition to the glance feature with the lumia black update is a pedometer functionality.
this new steps feature, scheduled for an early 2014 release, will track the number of steps taken with the phone and display them on the glance screen.
it's evident that nokia continues to invest heavily in customizing windows phone, with a particular emphasis on enhancing the glance feature.
the lumia black update is expected to commence its rollout to devices in the coming weeks.
in light of the recent tragic events involving young players in the nrl community, australia's prominent crisis support and suicide prevention organization expresses its readiness to strengthen its collaboration with the nrl.
the recent passing of nineteen-year-old francis winterstein, the brother of north queensland cowboys winger antonio winterstein, who was playing with the townsville club stingers while being on contract with the brisbane broncos, has deeply saddened the rugby league fraternity.
as cowboys winger antonio winterstein mourns the loss of his younger brother, the nrl community faces another wave of grief following the recent farewell of cowboys under-20 player regan grieve and the untimely death of hayden butler, a former melbourne storm player.
these tragic events have once again underscored the critical importance of addressing mental health challenges within professional sports, prompting a renewed focus on supporting the well-being of nrl athletes.
watford has reportedly reached agreements with tottenham for the transfer of french midfielders etienne capoue and benjamin stambouli, as per sources from sky.
capoue, aged 26, is reportedly close to finalizing personal terms, while negotiations are still in progress with stambouli, 24, but are yet to be concluded.
additionally, it is stated that watford has agreed on terms with greek forward jose holebas, but a transfer fee with his current club roma is yet to be settled.
capoue, who joined spurs from toulouse, struggled to secure a regular first-team spot under coaches tim sherwood and mauricio pochettino, featuring in only 19 premier league starts over two years.
stambouli, signed from montpellier the previous summer, similarly found it challenging to maintain a starting position, making just four league starts.
these potential signings are part of watford's recruitment drive following their promotion from the championship last season, with the club having already secured the services of sebastian prodl, giedrius arlauskis, and matej vydra.
meanwhile, tottenham is looking to streamline their squad ahead of the new season, with the likes of paulinho and lewis holtby having been sold, and further players like emmanuel adebayor, roberto soldado, younes kaboul, vlad chiriches, and aaron lennon reportedly available for transfer at the right price.
a fifth-grade teacher in fort mojave, william temple cole, was recently arrested on five counts of aggravated assault on a child for allegedly touching five female students on their backs while they were answering questions in class.
the mohave county sheriff's spokeswoman, trish carter, confirmed the arrest of the 70-year-old teacher who was subsequently released after posting bond the day after his arrest.
the investigation was initiated by deputies following reports from fort mojave elementary officials in november that raised concerns about possible inappropriate touching of female students.
carter clarified that the accusations against cole involve instances where he allegedly put his hand under the girls' shirts while they were posing questions during class, with no allegations of inappropriate touching on the chests or genitals.
despite attempts to reach out to cole for a statement, no immediate response was received to the message conveyed by the sheriff's office.
mit researchers have developed a method to meticulously control lab-grown microfibers, enabling the creation of intricate structures tailored for specific applications.
the team successfully manipulated the size and composition of individual wires during the growth process.
nurturing nanowires with "seed" particles, which are metal nanoparticles dictating the wire's characteristics, the researchers adjusted gas quantities to govern the seed particles' properties and consequently, the evolving nanowires.
employing electron tomography, they reconstructed the three-dimensional profiles of nanoscale wires.
the researchers believe that their breakthrough can enhance the efficiency of affordable led lights and solar panels.
the ban on synthetic cannabis, known by names such as kronic, northern lights, spice, and amsterdam high, has not effectively halted its distribution and may have inadvertently led to the emergence of more potent variants of the recreational substance.
despite australia's federal medicines regulator outlawing eight cannabis-like chemicals in july, law enforcement authorities are encountering challenges in curbing the proliferation of these drugs.
the synthetic weed continues to be readily available in melbourne through "legal high" stores, tobacconists, and adult shops, with suppliers adapting by adjusting formulations to include alternative yet similar-effect chemicals not covered by the ban.
according to victoria police, monitoring these substances proves difficult as their composition requires forensic analysis to identify, making regulation a complex task.
a dothan attorney, billy joe sheffield ii, has expressed discontent with the christmas tree displayed in the lobby of the houston county courthouse.
as reported by the dothan eagle, sheffield has submitted requests seeking to postpone his cases until after the holidays or until the tree is taken down.
although not against the tree itself, sheffield is concerned that the photographs of crime victims adorning it could potentially sway jurors.
the tree was erected by pat jones, the founder and president of the southeast alabama chapter of victims of crime and leniency.
established by jones in 1995, the local vocal chapter has a personal significance to her, having been created five years after her mother's tragic murder.
positioned near the elevators on the courthouse's first floor, sheffield's appeal for the removal of the tree in relation to his cases has mostly been rejected, with a few pending decisions yet to be made.
researchers at cape canaveral have announced the discovery of compelling evidence supporting the existence of a massive ninth planet in our solar system, dubbed planet x.
this celestial body is believed to be comparable in size to neptune and positioned far beyond the orbit of neptune, requiring an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 years to complete a single revolution around the sun.
referred to as planet 9 by a pair of caltech scientists, the elusive planet has yet to be visually confirmed.
the researchers have employed advanced mathematical and computer simulations to support their assertion and are optimistic about the prospect of its identification through telescopic observation within the next five years.
their research findings were unveiled in the astronomical journal and they are confident that once discovered, any lingering controversies akin to the demotion of pluto's planetary status will be avoided.
notably, one of the researchers, mike brown, is famously known as the "pluto killer." nba commissioner david stern and dallas mavericks owner mark cuban, known for their occasional disagreements, both share a desire to end the one-and-done practice among nba draft prospects.
currently, american players must be at least 19 years old and one year out of high school to be eligible for the nba draft, resulting in a influx of talented freshmen declaring each year.
stern suggested extending the rule by an additional year, while cuban proposed a more radical approach, advocating for a three-year waiting period post-high school graduation for draft eligibility.
cuban humorously remarked on the lack of support for the one-and-done rule outside of kentucky fans.
any changes to draft eligibility rules would need approval from the players' union, which was not a priority during the nba's recent collective bargaining agreement negotiations amid the lockout.
the union has only agreed to establish a committee to explore potential modifications at this juncture.
sergio ramos, who has been sidelined with a knee injury since october 9, was initially expected to be out for six weeks.
however, his diligent efforts towards recovery are showing promising results.
just two weeks after his injury, ramos is on track to return earlier than anticipated, missing the next five matches to focus on completing his recovery during the upcoming international break.
with his eyes set on making a comeback in time for the real madrid vs.
atletico madrid derby on november 19, ramos is determined to resume playing without jeopardizing his recovery process.
his commitment to following a prescribed regimen and receiving proper treatment underscores his exceptional fitness level.
azerbaijan authorities have denied claims of targeting gay and transgender individuals in the country.
in a joint statement on tuesday, the interior ministry and the prosecutor general's office addressed allegations of a crackdown in baku, stating that the raids were instead focused on individuals accused of providing sexual services without consent, breaching public order, and spreading contagious diseases.
they confirmed that all 83 individuals detained between september 15-30 have been released, while 32 with sexually transmitted diseases were directed for medical care.
among them, 12 were found to have hiv, with six progressing to aids.
this response by the authorities comes in the wake of human rights groups' criticisms accusing azerbaijani officials of suppressing lgbt communities.
despite decriminalization of homosexuality in 2000 in predominantly muslim azerbaijan, discriminatory sentiments against lgbt groups persist.
a 34-year-old man named shelton dinganga from mambo, zimbabwe, passed away while receiving treatment from a traditional healer due to a prolonged erection.
dinganga's condition reportedly resulted from engaging in sexual activity with a married woman.
according to his relatives, dinganga had intimate relations with a relative's wife, which caused his penis to remain erect and other body parts to swell.
after returning from kwekwe, where he was allegedly involved with a family member, dinganga went missing from public view.
his family later revealed his death on a tuesday morning.
during dinganga's funeral, it became known that his inability to retract his erection was connected to his encounter with the female relative in kwekwe.
despite efforts by his family to take him to the hospital, dinganga refused assistance and ultimately succumbed to the condition.
to avoid discussing his demise or alleged affair, dinganga's family declined to provide any comments on the matter.

guardiola: monaco's menacing presence in the box draws attention from real madrid

monaco's excellence in the box has intrigued top clubs, including real madrid, who are closely eyeing their star players bernardo silva and kylian mbappe.
the spanish giants are known for their proactive approach in the transfer market, constantly on the lookout for emerging talents.
the exceptional performances of silva, bakayoko, lemar, and mbappe under coach leonardo jardim have not gone unnoticed.
bernardo silva, in particular, has garnered interest from real madrid due to his impressive displays as a talented 22-year-old attacking midfielder.
mbappe's lethal partnership with falcao and goal-scoring abilities have drawn comparisons to a young thierry henry.
real madrid's scouting reports on both players have been resoundingly positive as the club remains determined not to miss out on talents like ousmane dembele or alexander isak again.
mbappe, hailed as the youngest ever scorer for monaco, has proven his mettle since his debut in december 2015, showcasing maturity beyond his years with significant first-team experience.
concurrently, atletico madrid have shown interest in the 21-year-old midfielder thomas lemar.
it appears inevitable that these monaco stars will not remain at the club for long, with real madrid keen on securing the services of the best talents available.
a contender seeking to become the next west australian senator for the liberal party publicly referred to advocates of refugee-friendly policies as "cockroaches" invading his previous electorate.
michael sutherland, the former speaker in the wa parliament who lost his inner-city seat in march, made these remarks during a recent liberal party gathering in sydney.
he is among the five individuals competing for the senate vacancy resulting from the retirement of liberal chris back.
sutherland, who hails from south africa, has not validated his renouncement of dual-citizenship, even in the wake of two greens senators stepping down last week due to their foreign citizenship status.
in a discussion about countering anti-fracking campaign groups, mr.
sutherland expressed concern that such activists had proliferated in his past electoral area of mount lawley.
in december, we covered an updated feature in the youtube app on android known as the "pseudo-drawer." this new feature replaced the previously seen horizontal list of avatars and activity indicators with a vertical scrollable list of subscriptions showing avatars, names, and corresponding numbers.
recent updates have modified the drawer's behavior - it now overlaps the user interface when expanded, rather than pushing content aside.
the most notable improvement is the addition of filters in the drawer header, allowing users to organize their subscriptions by relevance or new activity, rather than simply listing them under "channels." these changes are currently being gradually rolled out, so you may not have access to them on your device yet.
nonetheless, these updates demonstrate a more thoughtful approach to designing for tablets.
republican lawmakers have passed a bill that forfeits federal funds to eliminate state financing for planned parenthood.
the senate judiciary committee voted 8-5 in favor of the legislation on tuesday, and it will now advance to the senate for a comprehensive floor vote.
the bill is well-supported by the republican majority in both the senate and house.
it suggests that iowa give up federal medicaid funds to establish a state-run program for distributing resources for family planning services.
the bill specifically excludes funding for abortion-providing organizations, even though current family planning funding does not support abortions.
proponents argue that the bill would redirect funds to rural health clinics that offer family planning services, while opponents, particularly democrats, argue that it would reduce access to quality healthcare.
north korea's state television broadcasted photos and videos depicting the forceful removal of kim jong-un's influential uncle, jang song-thaek, from a government meeting.
jang, a close companion of kim, was ousted due to alleged misconduct, such as corruption, womanizing, and drug abuse, as reported by reuters.
the korean central news agency (kcna) stated through the bbc that jang was described as "ideologically sick" and accused of extravagance at foreign casinos while undergoing medical treatment abroad.
additionally, the bbc revealed footage from kcna showing jang being digitally erased from past interactions with kim.
these extraordinary events present a rare glimpse into the inner workings of north korea, according to the bbc's seoul correspondent, lucy williamson.
a 32-year-old man from bartow has been arrested by deputies for allegedly assaulting a 2-year-old boy with a clothes hanger.
the incident occurred because the child, who has a speech impediment, was unable to correctly pronounce his sister's name.
the child was taken to winter haven hospital for treatment of a black eye and further examination revealed bruises on various parts of his body, including a fractured orbital bone that could lead to permanent eye damage.
during questioning, the man, identified as david lee sinnett, admitted to hitting the boy out of frustration over his speech difficulties and also confessed to hitting him on the back for being too close to a wall outlet.
sinnett claimed that the facial bruises were a result of the child falling off a skateboard days earlier.
sinnett has a history of arrests, including one for attempted second-degree murder in 2005, and he is now facing charges of aggravated child abuse.
he is currently held in polk county jail without bond.
the nature of the relationship between sinnett and the boy has not been disclosed by authorities.
each year, millions of young girls globally are coerced into marriage, a practice that is banned in numerous countries and denounced by international agreements.
despite these measures, child marriage persists across diverse regions, cultures, and beliefs.
photographer stephanie sinclair has dedicated eight years to investigating this issue in countries such as india, yemen, afghanistan, nepal, and ethiopia.
through a multimedia project in collaboration with national geographic, she sheds light on the urgent need for action.
in a companion piece, sinclair shares poignant stories of the hardships faced by child brides and emphasizes the importance of amplifying their voices.
her evocative photographs are prominently featured in a national geographic article on child marriage in the june 2011 edition, where resources are provided by the magazine for those looking to support organizations working to combat this harmful practice and empower young girls to fulfill their potential.
around 20 juvenile offenders participated in a riot at a youth jail in north queensland, during which they hurled objects at prison workers while making demands that included the re-election of us president barack obama.
the incident escalated quickly as the offenders, who were initially playing football on the oval, seized the opportunity to cause mayhem when staff attention was diverted elsewhere in the townsville facility.
this led to a situation where the offenders gained control over the center, with some even climbing onto the roof and making requests for kfc, drugs, and alcohol unless mr.
obama was re-elected for an unconstitutional third term.
assistant commissioner paul taylor confirmed that during the chaos, 29 staff members sought shelter in the visitor center, with four sustaining injuries.
sydney's bus drivers report an escalating frequency of issues with the opal card system, noting a surge in malfunctions of ticket readers.
despite earlier warnings from transport minister gladys berejiklian about the complexities of integrating the smartcard with buses, unions representing drivers from state transit and private bus networks observe a rising number of breakdowns in opal readers.
a recent survey conducted by the transport workers union, representing drivers from private bus operators, revealed that 60% of 58 drivers sampled encountered problems with opal readers on a daily basis.
in the past four decades, the tax code has been heavily influenced by corporations and trickle-down economics, resulting in significant tax breaks for the affluent and businesses.
despite promises of widespread growth, these reduced rates have not delivered as expected, leading to a rise in wealth disparity without a corresponding surge in overall economic progress for the average american.
consequently, median wages have remained stagnant, and the u.s. currently ranks 10th among 13 oecd nations in terms of upward mobility.
to rectify this situation, the u.s. urgently requires a comprehensive review of tax incentives and their impact on different economic activities.
drawing from the insights of renowned economist joseph e.
stiglitz of the roosevelt institute, we advocate for a fundamental shift in the way we approach the tax system.
instead of merely rectifying poor outcomes after the fact, we propose reconfiguring the tax code to encourage productive economic behaviors and foster a more equitable distribution of wealth before taxes are applied.
by adjusting incentives, the tax system can mitigate risky and unproductive economic practices.
measures such as closing loopholes, imposing high taxes on detrimental activities, and focusing tax cuts and subsidies on beneficial investments can collectively promote inclusive growth and societal well-being.
our proposal accentuates a vision for tax reform anchored in progressivity and constructive incentives, with the ultimate goal of realizing inclusive growth.

men, including hipsters, seem to grow beards as a means of projecting aggression and dominance towards other men.
this phenomenon can be attributed to a study that examined over 100 primate species, revealing that males often develop distinct physical traits or "badges" to assert dominance and attract mates.
these badges can range from elongated noses and cheek flanges to beards, serving as a visual cue of competitive edge.
the research, led by scientists at the university of western australia, suggests that in societies with intense competition, these distinguishing features play a crucial role in standing out among peers.
cyril grueter, the lead author of the study, highlighted the significance of such ornaments in assessing strength and quality, particularly in larger group settings where individuals may be unfamiliar to one another.
ohio voters are being urged to complete their registration by the end of today to ensure eligibility for the upcoming november election.
the deadline for voter registration forms is tuesday, october 10th and can be submitted to local county board of elections offices or online through the secretary of state's website.
required information for online registration includes an ohio driver's license or id card number, name, date of birth, address, and the last four digits of the social security number.
starting from october 11th until the november 7th election date, voters will have the opportunity to cast their ballots on two statewide issues, including addressing victims' rights and prescription prices.
locally, voter attention is drawn to various races such as youngstown mayor, warren city auditor, and columbiana city mayor, along with an array of levies on ballots covering safety forces, ambulance services, and parks and cemetery matters.
in a recent washington post-abc news poll, the lack of cooperation in washington is noted as a concern among americans, with most expressing a desire for both sides to work together to pass comprehensive health care reform.
the poll reveals that nearly six in 10 americans believe that republicans are not making enough efforts to compromise with president obama on important issues, while over four in 10 think obama could do more to garner gop support.
among independents, over half view the congressional republicans as too inflexible, and a similar number hold the same perception of the president.
despite the desire for bipartisanship, it is acknowledged that it is easier to expect compromise from the opposing side.
notably, nearly two-thirds of americans, including a majority of democrats, independents, and some republicans, support congress continuing its efforts to achieve comprehensive health care reform.
the challenge lies in the fact that while most democrats perceive the congressional republicans as unyielding, a substantial number of republicans also critique their own party's leaders for not doing enough to collaborate with obama.
it is interesting to note that some liberal democrats feel that obama is compromising too much with the gop on major issues.
additional findings from the poll will be published in the washington post, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for the full random sample of 1,004 adults surveyed from thursday to monday.
scott ryan, a former minister in the turnbull government, has been elected as the new senate president, taking over from stephen parry, who was involved in the citizenship debacle.
senator ryan stepped down from his position as special minister of state to fill the vacancy left by mr.
parry, who had to resign from parliament due to his dual citizenship status.
the victorian liberal senator emerged victorious over the greens candidate peter whish-wilson in a ballot that took place on monday.
in his address to parliament, senator ryan expressed surprise at the turn of events, remarking, "it was not a circumstance i thought would present itself nor one i thought would present itself to me in the year immediately." while the greens contended that having a crossbench president would help restore integrity to parliament, senator whish-wilson criticized the government for its handling of the citizenship crisis, labeling it a disgrace that brought disrespect to the position of the senate president.
senator ryan secured 53 votes, outstripping senator whish-wilson's tally of 11, with one ballot paper deemed invalid.
shia labeouf, recognized as a prominent young artist, has been engaging in livestream art performances, with his latest project being particularly noteworthy.
commencing at the museum of the moving image in new york, "he will not divide us" is a long-term endeavor coinciding with the inauguration of donald trump.

despite the ambitious four-year commitment, shia's initiative underscores his dedication to a cause greater than himself.
at a time when many view january 20, 2017, as a challenging period, endeavors like this offer a glimmer of hope and solidarity for those opposed to trump's administration.
the contentious club suffered a 1-0 defeat in the second leg against second division runners-up aarau, however, managed to secure a comfortable 3-1 aggregate victory.
sion narrowly avoided finishing at the bottom of the table as neuchatel xamax was expelled from the league in january due to financial misconduct under owner bulat chagaev.
neuchatel ended at the bottom of the standings, leading to direct relegation, thus granting sion ninth place and an opportunity for a play-off position.
aarau raised objections concerning the participation of sion's serey die, who had recently received an eight-match suspension for an incident where he struck a ball boy.
die contested the ban and, following competition regulations, was permitted to continue playing until his appeal hearing, which was anticipated in the next season.
sion had been disqualified from the europa league for utilizing players signed during a fifa transfer embargo.
despite club president christian constantin's legal challenge against fifa and uefa regulations, switzerland faced the threat of an international suspension unless actions were taken against sion.
sion was ultimately penalized with a deduction of 36 points.
the season was filled with turmoil, marked by crowd disturbances prompting the abandonment of a grasshoppers-fc zurich derby and servette geneva facing bankruptcy.
two months following a tragic incident where a gunman claimed numerous lives at an orlando nightclub, the atmosphere turned chaotic at an orlando mall as shoppers fled in panic upon hearing the sounds of popping balloons, resulting in nine injuries.
according to orange county sheriff's officials spokeswoman deputy rose silva, the commotion at the florida mall was not due to an armed threat; rather, it was caused by six large balloons being popped as part of a standard safety inspection for the grand opening of former 'nsync singer joey fatone's new restaurant.
despite an announcement being made via the pa system to alert shoppers and staff about the upcoming test, the unexpected loud noises still caused a hurried evacuation.
orange county fire and rescue officials confirmed that nine individuals received initial medical attention on the premises, with four subsequently being hospitalized for minor injuries.
brendan rodgers has made a single adjustment to his liverpool lineup for their match against crystal palace at anfield on saturday.
raheem sterling has been brought in to replace the suspended lucas leiva in the reds' squad.

the los angeles dodgers had to forfeit a game to the st.
louis cardinals in the ninth inning last night due to multiple instances of fans tossing souvenir baseballs onto the field at dodger stadium.
this marked the first forfeit in the major leagues since july 12, 1979, when a detroit vs.
chicago doubleheader was called off due to disruptive anti-disco activities rendering the field unplayable.
at the time of the incident, the cardinals were ahead 2-1 in the bottom of the ninth inning when raul mondesi was ejected after arguing over called strikes, following which manager tom lasorda was also ejected.
as fans began throwing baseballs onto the field, the umpires halted the game and instructed the cardinals to vacate the field for safety.
once the field was cleared, play resumed briefly before additional baseballs were thrown, prompting the umpires to ultimately call off the game.
in another occurrence, there was a six-minute delay during the seventh inning when more baseballs were hurled onto the field from the stands.
in reflecting on his past seasons with real madrid and manchester united, javier 'chicharito' hernandez attributes his lack of success to his limited playing time.
scoring 26 goals for bayer leverkusen in the current campaign, hernandez was grateful for the opportunity to showcase his abilities as the team's primary striker.
comparing his scoring record from his time at manchester united, where he scored 65 goals in 80 starts, to real madrid, where he managed 9 goals in just 12 starts, hernandez emphasized that consistent minutes were crucial in demonstrating his capabilities.
with his contract at leverkusen running until 2018, hernandez remains committed to the club after joining them last summer for 12 million euros.
in aesthetic theory, the sublime is characterized as a powerful and awe-inspiring phenomenon that elicits a peculiar sense of pleasure in the observer.
for instance, when faced with the grandeur of a hurricane or an expansive desert landscape, one may experience a mixture of being overwhelmed by the object's immense force yet simultaneously uplifted.
according to schopenhauer, the sublime entails a moment of a "turning away of the will," where the sheer force of the object subdues our will and redirects it away from ourselves, plunging us into a state of will-less contemplation that brings about a peculiar sense of exultation.
this state is delicate and hard to sustain since any acknowledgment of the inherent danger posed by the object or self-reflection in its context can shatter the sublime experience.
this means that while we might feel the sublime when witnessing the might of a tornado, the feeling could shift to ordinary terror if we realize the tornado is heading towards us.
the concept has been explored in an older comic of mine, delving into this aesthetic theory in a more serious tone.
for further insights, i recommend a lecture on schopenhauer's aesthetics by alex neill and the relevant article in the stanford encyclopedia.
the artwork in question references caspar david friedrich's iconic painting "wanderer above the sea of fog," commonly associated with the representation of the sublime in art, reflecting friedrich's consistent exploration of similar themes in his other works.
rhode island state police confirmed the apprehension of donald morgan, the individual sought for the theft of a state police cruiser, after the nbc 10 i-team first broke the news of his arrest on friday evening in cumberland.
authorities disclosed that members of the rhode island violent fugitive task force were responsible for his capture.
morgan is presently detained and is expected to appear in court on saturday.
earlier during the week, the incident unfolded when morgan somehow transitioned from the back seat to the driver's seat of a state police vehicle, absconding while the trooper was outside attending to a vehicular accident.
although the cruiser was swiftly recovered near the providence-cranston line, morgan, aged 35, managed to evade detection.
the pursuit concluded with officers firing 40 rounds at a truck close to the providence place mall, resulting in the fatality of the fleeing driver and injuries to the passenger, who were later determined to be unrelated to morgan.

fiji's interim prime minister criticized fiji water for its decision to cease operations in the pacific nation where the brand originated, implying that the company lacks concern for the country.
the company, owned by california entrepreneurs lynda and stewart resnick, announced on monday its closure of the fiji facility, discontinuation of orders from suppliers, and suspension of construction contracts in the country.
the decision to withdraw was prompted by a significant tax hike imposed by the military-led government under the self-appointed prime minister frank bainimarama.
in response, commodore bainimarama accused fiji water of unjustly berating the south pacific nation, stating, "fiji water's actions once again demonstrate a lack of regard for fiji and its people." architectural historian dr.

the reluctance of most politicians to openly acknowledge australia's deep-seated divisions reflects their aversion to the term "class." by shying away from discussing the unequal societal structures, politicians aim to sidestep radical perceptions.
the introduction of the notion that certain segments of society have advantages over others leads to complex and uncomfortable inquiries.
despite the national narrative of egalitarianism and the myth of meritocratic success, the reality of societal stratification remains largely unaddressed.
australians tend to identify themselves as middle class, embodying the country's image of stability and prosperity.
in a thrilling elimination game, the toronto blue jays clinched a 6-3 victory over the texas rangers, propelling them to the american league championship series.
the game was deadlocked at 2-2 entering the seventh inning, where an eventful 53-minute frame unfolded.
a peculiar incident occurred when russell martin accidentally hit shin-soo choo's bat while returning the ball to the pitcher, allowing rougned odor to score a run from third base.
amidst chaos in the rogers centre with fans tossing beer bottles and garbage onto the field, the play was initially halted before odor was eventually granted the run.
the tension heightened as the blue jays capitalized on three consecutive errors by the rangers to load the bases.
josh donaldson knotted the score with a shallow single, setting the stage for jose bautista's game-changing three-run homer to left field off sam dyson.
the blue jays entrusted 20-year-old closer roberto osuna to secure the final five outs flawlessly, striking out four out of five batters to secure the save and advance to the next round.
their next opponents will be determined in the match between the kansas city royals and the houston astros later in the evening.
scientists recently observed an unusual occurrence near the azores islands, an archipelago located approximately 900 miles off the coast of portugal.
as detailed in a recent report by science magazine, two behavioral ecologists from the german marine research firm leibniz institute of freshwater ecology and inland fisheries witnessed an adult bottlenose dolphin with an s-shaped spine engaging in affectionate behavior as it interacted with a group of sperm whales traveling together.
the researchers documented this unique behavior on seven occasions during an eight-day period in 2011, suggesting that the relationship between the dolphin and the whales was purely social in nature.
the scientists hypothesized that the dolphin's scoliosis may have hindered its ability to keep pace with its own pod or affected its social standing, prompting the dolphin to seek companionship with the whales.
while such inter-species friendships are rare, instances of dolphins befriending whales have been reported before, such as a similar incident in 2008 involving a bottlenose dolphin aiding pygmy sperm whales.
the bbc reported that these species may share basic communication signals, as observed by justin gregg of the dolphin communication project, pointing out that the means of communication between different species are likely rudimentary yet effective.
the conservation status of sperm whales appears to be improving, as the international union for conservation of nature (iucn) indicates that while past commercial whaling severely impacted global sperm whale populations, conservation efforts have resulted in reduced whaling activities and the possibility of population recovery.
the full dna sequence of the potato has been unveiled by an international team for the first time, as reported by the journal nature.
this breakthrough offers the potential to enhance the harvests of one of the world's most significant staple crops.
scientists at the james hutton institute in dundee, who were part of the research, believe that this discovery will facilitate the rapid development of improved potato varieties.
essentially, the genome serves as a blueprint of how an organism's genes are arranged, with each gene governing various aspects of growth and development.
subtle alterations in these genetic instructions lead to the diversity of potato varieties.
professor iain gordon, the ceo of the james hutton institute, anticipates that decoding the potato genome will empower breeders to cultivate healthier varieties that are also resistant to pests and diseases.
he envisions that this advancement will help meet the challenge of nourishing the growing global population.
although the research is still ongoing, understanding the plant's genetic makeup is expected to require several more years.
currently, it can take over a decade to breed an improved potato variety.
by pinpointing the genes regulating traits such as yield, color, starch content, and flavor, researchers aim to expedite the development of superior potato cultivars.
potatoes rank as the world's fourth-largest crop, with an annual global production of 330 million tonnes.
hay producers are currently facing challenges meeting the increased demand for animal feed, particularly from livestock producers in the western regions affected by the ongoing drought.
in british columbia, alberta, saskatchewan, and manitoba, cattle ranchers are experiencing shortages and actively seeking supplies to sustain their livestock during the approaching fall and winter seasons.
the surge in demand has caused prices to surge, with bob seaman from valley hay and cattle in southern calgary reporting a backlog of 300 producers requesting feed.
according to him, this situation somewhat compensates for hay growers who have grappled with years of elevated fuel costs and diminished returns.
brian perillat, the head of canfax at the canadian cattlemen's association, notes that hay prices have more than doubled compared to the previous year.
he adds that despite this increase, the near-record-high beef prices have somewhat mitigated the impact of the soaring feed costs on cattle producers.

a new law signed by president putin on monday stipulates that russian firms holding a controlling stake outside the country are ineligible to request state assistance.
this prohibition extends to russian legal entities with over 50 percent of authorized capital located abroad.
the scope of the law encompasses not only the entities themselves but also their beneficiaries, or individuals who stand to gain from such transactions.
the legislation further restricts government subsidies from being utilized for foreign currency procurement, except for acquiring high-tech equipment, raw materials, or components.
nevertheless, if an offshore firm promotes russian product exports, it remains eligible for government aid, as the ultimate beneficiaries in such scenarios are domestic exporters.
this development follows putin's directive to the government to finalize the roster of companies slated for privatization.
the president stressed the necessity for transparent privatization processes, ensuring that assets are divested at fair market prices rather than discounts.
additionally, he emphasized the importance of safeguarding state control over strategic enterprises to prevent privatized assets from exiting russian jurisdiction.
in a related move last july, putin approved a law that bars government agencies from engaging with offshore entities in procurement.
the legislative measures aim to bolster domestic producers, foster import substitution, and repatriate capital from offshore havens back into the russian economy.

on monday, a prosecutor asserted that the new york police officers who fatally shot sean bell, an unarmed black man, with 50 shots on his wedding day displayed recklessness and desperation to make an arrest as their vice unit was on the verge of being disbanded.
the two officers faced charges of manslaughter, while a third was charged with reckless endangerment in connection to the 2006 incident that occurred after bell's bachelor party at a strip club.
the case stirred widespread outrage in the black community of new york.
civil rights activist al sharpton was seated beside bell's fiance, nicole paultre, in a courtroom filled with the victim's friends and relatives as well as police officers supporting the defendants.
outside, protesters called for murder charges against the officers, holding up numbered signs from 1 to 50 and chanting each number in unison.
a ruling by an appeals court in cairo has overturned the convictions of four egyptian policemen related to the deaths of 37 detainees last august.
in march, the deputy chief of heliopolis police station, lt.
amr farouk, was sentenced to 10 years for involuntary manslaughter and extreme negligence.
meanwhile, the three other officers received one-year suspended sentences.
the detainees had tragically died from asphyxiation caused by tear gas fired into the vehicle transporting them to prison.
initially, security officials had claimed that the detainees, said to be islamist supporters of deposed president mohammed morsi, had instigated a riot and overpowered a guard during their transfer to abu zabal prison on august 18.
as a result, the officers allegedly resorted to using tear gas inside the vehicle with 45 detainees onboard.
experts in crowd-control at the time pointed out that the detainees would have suffered a painful death, struggling for breath and unable to defend themselves against the guards.
following the recent decision by the appeals court, the case has been referred back to the general prosecution for further inquiry, which effectively restarts the legal process.
human rights lawyer amr imam informed afp news agency that this action implies the case will need to begin afresh.
the deaths had garnered global criticism, including comments from un secretary-general ban ki-moon, who expressed deep concern over the incident.
the fatalities occurred shortly after security forces dispersed two protest camps in cairo, resulting in the deaths of nearly 1,000 individuals, a few days after the military ousted president morsi from power in july.
since then, thousands of islamists, including morsi and other prominent members of the muslim brotherhood, have been arrested and are facing various charges such as incitement to murder and collaborating with external entities to sow turmoil within egypt.

recent research in monkeys has provided initial proof that a prominent drug developed for combatting ebola is effective against the current strain responsible for the outbreak in west africa.
in the study, six monkeys were deliberately infected with a high dosage of the virus, following which, half of them were administered the drug tkm-ebola-makona, specifically formulated to target the west african strain, three days later.
the results revealed that the monkeys treated with the drug survived, while the untreated ones succumbed to the virus.
these findings were reported by researchers in the journal nature on wednesday.
tkm-ebola-makona is currently undergoing testing on ebola patients in sierra leone; however, the outcomes are pending.
the drug's earlier version, intended for a slightly different strain, was administered to some ebola patients in the us, although it was inconclusive whether it aided their recovery due to concurrent additional treatments.
administered intravenously, these drugs may induce flu-like symptoms such as headaches, chills, and fever.
categorized as short interfering rnas (sirnas), they function by obstructing specific genes in the virus, hampering its replication.
the drugs' composition is tailored to the genetic makeup of the virus, although the potential for mutation and emergence of new strains raises questions about their broad efficacy against various strains of the same virus.
microsoft has officially announced its plans to introduce two-factor authentication for its accounts.
the company will be rolling out an optional two-factor authentication service as part of an upgrade to microsoft accounts in the coming days.
this security feature will provide enhanced protection by requiring a verification process with codes for the entire microsoft account.
users will have the option to use app passwords for services like xbox that do not currently support two-factor authentication directly, similar to google.
while microsoft has previously offered additional authentication methods for specific parts of accounts, this new two-factor authentication is being extended to cover the entire microsoft account, ensuring comprehensive protection for all types of data access.
unlike before, where users could access certain data without two-step verification, this upgrade will enforce security measures across all data types.
a dedicated windows phone app has already been released to support this service, following a standard protocol for two-step verification codes which can also be used for gmail and dropbox accounts.
although microsoft has not confirmed versions for ios and android, its web-based two-step system will be compatible with these devices.
users can set up two-factor authentication through microsoft's account management page.

spring arrived in berlin amid lingering frost this week as george clooney oversaw the transformation of the city for the filming of the monuments men, a movie set during the latter days of world war ii.
based on actual events, the movie depicts a group of us military personnel, consisting of museum professionals and art experts, tasked with retrieving artworks stolen by the nazis.
in addition to directing, clooney stars alongside a star-studded cast including matt damon, cate blanchett, bill murray, jean dujardin, bob balaban, hugh bonneville, and john goodman.
filming commenced a fortnight ago in berlin and nearby potsdam, focusing initially on indoor scenes.
the bush administration is taking steps to close down an illegal pipeline that was used to transport iraqi oil to syria.
despite this move, it has been noted that the united states and american oil companies have been importing syrian oil for some time, especially after the pipeline started operating about three years ago, as mentioned by industry experts.
recent reports indicate that syria has informed its oil buyers of a reduction in exports by 200,000 barrels per day for the remainder of the year, possibly in anticipation of the pipeline closure.
the pipeline, which handled between 150,000 to 250,000 barrels daily, was widely known within the oil industry and even at the united nations security council.
efforts by council members to seek clarification from syria were hindered by russia, france, and china, according to a united nations diplomat.
chalabi, a former opec acting secretary general from iraq and current executive director of the center for global energy studies in london, highlighted the significant benefits that both syria and iraq derived from the pipeline.
the decision to close the pipeline was announced by defense secretary donald h.
rumsfeld on tuesday as part of the u.s. administration's strategy to exert pressure on syria, which had been labeled a "rogue state" the day before due to accusations of sheltering iraqi fugitives and developing chemical weapons.
effective september 1st, a county will implement a comprehensive smoke-free policy that includes prohibiting the use of e-cigarettes.
this initiative extends to all outdoor spaces, such as parking lots and vehicles, within the region.
following the example set by cumberland county, sagadahoc county is taking a stand against tobacco products, with the intention of encouraging more individuals to quit smoking.
supporters of the ban believe it will not only reduce litter on the streets but also protect the health of non-smokers and those who prefer to avoid secondhand smoke.
however, opponents argue that people have the freedom to choose the air they breathe.
while many agree with indoor smoking restrictions, there is dissatisfaction with the expansion of regulations to outdoor areas.
furthermore, efforts are being made by the county to support employees in their efforts to quit smoking.

this paper, written on august 10, 2017, explores the impact of counterproductive responses to unfavorable trading prices on economic efficiency.
it investigates whether implementing a competitive pricing mechanism can help reduce inefficiencies stemming from these reactions.
the study presents findings from a laboratory experiment involving a powerful buyer engaging with two sellers, a scenario where sellers may face exceptionally low prices.
the results indicate that when the buyer employs a competitive auction instead of setting prices unilaterally, sellers are less likely to retaliate against low procurement prices.
this suggests that the adoption of competitive pricing mechanisms could alleviate inefficient responses to imbalances in trade surplus distributions.
aereo faced legal challenges and was ultimately shut down for streaming ota tv service online, in contrast, airtv is not expected to encounter similar issues with sling tv as users are relying on their personal antennas to access legally available signals.
the integration of ota channels into sling tv's channel guide is still uncertain, but the hope is that they will seamlessly fit in.
previously, sling tv had offered ota antennas along with its service, encouraging customers to access local channels outside of the sling app.
the airtv box represents a logical progression, enabling users to watch these channels wherever sling tv is accessible.
reports from zats not funny suggest that the company is developing various new devices.
although airtv can currently only transmit tv signals over the internet, it's conceivable that a future device could also connect directly to a tv to function as a standalone sling tv solution.
while sling does not need to obtain channel licensing for airtv, its presence may create tensions with broadcast network partnerships.
the quality of ota reception can significantly vary based on location and antenna quality.
setting up airtv may not be as straightforward as aereo, but it could serve as a valuable tool for many cord-cutters.
former hearts captain perry kitchen is set to join the danish superliga team randers.
kitchen, who is 25 years old, participated in hearts' victory over livingston during pre-season.
he departed from hearts' training camp in dublin and is currently in denmark for advanced discussions with randers.
it is anticipated that there will be no transfer fee involved in the potential deal, which could be finalized by wednesday evening.
kitchen, a united states international, had a lack of game time under ian cathro last season, not featuring in eight matches since february.
he relinquished his captaincy to new arrival christophe berra, who rejoined the team at the beginning of the summer.
since his arrival at tynecastle in march 2016 under the management of robbie neilson, kitchen has made 45 appearances for hearts.

downing street has confirmed that prime minister gordon brown's new website is experiencing initial issues.
the site, called number 10 tv, is part of mr brown's initiative to connect with a broader audience and will showcase exclusive video coverage of his speeches and media engagements.
users have reported encountering a "404 page not found" error message when attempting to access the site, and while a downing street spokeswoman denied that the site had crashed, she acknowledged the possibility of temporary glitches for some servers over the next 48 hours.
the revamped downing street website, which now includes number 10 tv along with news updates, virtual tours of number 10, and official reports, aims to enhance the volume of video content available to the public.
this move follows conservative leader david cameron's launch of webcameron two years prior, which also offers exclusive footage.

metairie-- despite being a charming city, potholes continue to plague our streets.
have you ever pondered the stark contrast between the pothole-ridden roads and the relatively smooth bike paths?
delving into this disparity, we discovered that both roads and bike paths are constructed using similar materials - asphalt, concrete, or a blend of the two.
mike jernigan, the public works director for the city of new orleans, clarified that most bike lanes are situated on resurfaced streets.
the root cause of the persistent potholes lies beneath the surface, as the city’s 299-year history houses unknown subterranean complexities like gas and water lines.
these hidden factors, when they malfunction, create cracks that evolve into dreaded potholes.
consequently, bike paths don't receive preferential treatment; rather, the volume of traffic and the weight of vehicles exert significant influence on street conditions.
placing a broadband red filter over one eye can enhance the color-naming ability of individuals with certain color vision deficiencies.
a similar outcome can be achieved by using a red-tinted contact lens marketed as the x-chrom lens.
this article delves into color vision defects, elucidates the red filter's optical impact, and scrutinizes various studies assessing the x-chrom lens's efficacy.
the author's conclusion suggests that while the lens may improve performance on specific color vision tests, it does not rectify color vision under natural conditions.
additionally, the potential adverse effects of using a red filter are explored.
it is recommended that wearers of the x-chrom lens are fully informed about its limitations and the visual distortions it may induce.

the us military has launched airstrikes utilizing fighter jets and drones against islamic state militants near the kurdish capital irbil, with the intention of supporting kurdish forces in retaking iraq's largest dam from jihadist control.
according to the pentagon, american fighter jets and drones effectively executed airstrikes in the vicinity of irbil and the mosul dam, specifically targeting the militants.
these operations were authorized in order to aid humanitarian initiatives in iraq and safeguard us personnel and infrastructures.

the afl has prohibited the glove worn by collingwood key forward travis cloke during his recent outstanding performance.
collingwood has presented the glove to the league, which has determined that it does not adhere to their regulations.
while the offense is not considered grave, it remains uncertain if cloke will be subjected to any penalties.
in the remarkable victory against gws last weekend, cloke scored four goals and secured 12 marks, five of which were contested.
this marked his most exceptional display of the season and followed a period where he struggled to maintain his spot in the senior team.
cloke utilized the glove to shield two swollen fingers on his right hand, debuting it the previous week in the match against carlton.
this instance was reportedly the first time in approximately a year that cloke had donned a glove during gameplay.
government research has revealed that in sydney, over half a million homes are currently occupied by "empty nester" older couples or singles aged 50 and above, with at least two empty bedrooms in each residence.
this study conducted by the department of planning and environment found that the equivalent of two decades' worth of housing supply is locked up in these unutilized rooms.
the research underscores the potential advantage to the city's housing supply if these homeowners considered downsizing to smaller accommodations, thus freeing up larger houses for young families.
nonetheless, despite efforts to promote this transition, planning minister rob stokes pointed out that the lack of alternative housing options poses a significant obstacle.
"our households have become increasingly diverse, and it's imperative that our housing solutions adapt to meet these changing needs," mr.
once again, pakistan's involvement in sending armed terrorists to india has been revealed, resulting in significant embarrassment.
in a rare move, pakistan was compelled to acknowledge that the slain armed infiltrators killed by indian forces were indeed pakistani citizens.
the handover of the bodies of pakistani intruders at the borders of ajnala in amritsar marked a significant departure from pakistan's previous denial of the nationality of such infiltrators.
on thursday, the pakistani rangers accepted the mortal remains of the intruders, identified as pakistani nationals, which were handed over by the bsf on humanitarian grounds.
in a recent incident in the ajnala sector near amritsar on the night of 19-20 september, bsf personnel thwarted an armed infiltration attempt across the international boundary, resulting in the neutralization of two intruders.
a substantial cache of arms and ammunition was discovered in possession of the slain terrorists.

employees at the australian war memorial in canberra have recently declined a proposed pay and conditions agreement, while a similar resolution was reached at the australian fisheries management authority.
the aboriginal hostels union, represented by the cpsu, expressed satisfaction with the outcome and labeled the offer as subpar.
the cpsu deputy secretary, beth vincent-pietsch, criticized the offer as unsatisfactory, attributing it to the ineffective public sector bargaining policy of the turnbull government.
she emphasized that the proposed deal fell short of addressing the significant contribution of ahl workers in bridging the gap for indigenous australians and highlighted the disparity in pay within an organization with the highest proportion of indigenous employees in the public sector.
researchers at the garvan institute of medical research in sydney have made a breakthrough discovery involving the brain's stem cells that could potentially revolutionize treatment for neurological disorders like parkinson's and alzheimer's disease.
bryce vissel and andrea abdipranoto unveiled that a substance named activin a plays a crucial role in enabling the brain's stem cells to generate new nerve cells and facilitate brain repair post-neurodegeneration.
through experiments with a mouse model, the team demonstrated the brain's immediate response to nerve cell damage by initiating self-repair through the production of new cells.
they discovered that this process relies on the release of activin a, as inhibiting its action halts the regeneration process.
surprisingly, after a thorough five-year investigation, the researchers found that activin a indirectly aids in regeneration by impeding the replication and activation of inflammatory cells.

an employee informed the police that the men entered the store and made the threats, claiming they would shoot patrons.
additionally, it was mentioned in the police report that one of the men attempted to open a bank account, with the bank manager noting that the individual appeared intoxicated and was eventually escorted out after becoming aggressive.
the store manager indicated no awareness of any shooting intentions but proceeded to ban the individual from the premises.
meanwhile, the second man went to the automotive department for an oil change, where an employee there stated no knowledge of the shooting threats as per the police report.
it could be labeled as the enigma of the vanishing productivity crisis.
recent national accounts released for the december quarter confirmed that any underlying concerns regarding poor productivity growth seem to have dissipated.
the real puzzle lies in the fact that despite the apparent disappearance of the productivity crisis, those who vocally raised alarms about it have remained largely silent about its resolution.
for some time, major corporations had been advocating for a revamp of labor productivity, citing the need to revert to the pro-employer bias of the howard government's workchoices policy.
some even went to the extent of attributing the lackluster productivity growth to the fair work changes introduced by the labor party.
there was also a persistent clamor for a significant reduction in corporate tax rates as a remedy to enhance productivity.
the eagerness with which these arguments were presented, especially by leading national newspapers, underlines their concern for productivity.
however, in their coverage of the national accounts, both failed to acknowledge the positive developments in this critical area.
this omission raises suspicions that the rallying cry for productivity improvements may have been a guise for advancing the self-serving agenda of big businesses.
the narrative seems to imply that altering regulations in their favor would yield substantial economic benefits.
cristiano ronaldo is dealing with a partially torn mcl, with initial assessments by portuguese doctors in france suggesting an absence of up to four to five months.
if this prognosis is verified, ronaldo could miss the uefa supercup for madrid and a few early matches in the 2016-17 liga bbva season.
despite not immediately seeking hospital care after his departure from the match, further tests on his left knee are required to determine the extent of his injury.
ronaldo was compelled to exit the final following a forceful challenge by dimitri payet early in the game.
although he initially attempted to remain on the field, he eventually succumbed to the discomfort in his knee.
portugal triumphed in the tournament without their captain, allowing ronaldo ample reason to revel in their success, with his focus shifting to his knee in the coming days.
without a specific project in mind for this board, i selected entertaining features as i progressed.
opting for a smaller size since smaller is typically more efficient, i included exclusively usb a plugs.
i also incorporated perforations in case i needed to remove the board once it was programmed.
additionally, i decided to integrate a battery for added functionality.
by including the 2032 snaps, the board gains versatility for potential future projects in the next revision.
omitting through hole headers since it was unnecessary for breadboarding, i extended the pads to the edge while deactivating holes during my cam process.
keeping it straightforward, i focused on routing for single-sided boards and utilized 1206 zero ohm resistors and 6 mil traces.
the battery placement on the back influenced my decision to keep vias, making them 1mm drills to avoid additional steps on the pcb plotter.
an explosion in north-eastern colombia resulted in the tragic deaths of two soldiers and an eight-year-old boy.
reports from military officials indicate that the explosives responsible for the attack were planted by colombia's largest left-wing rebel group, the farc.
the incident, which also left three soldiers injured near the town of tame, highlights the deteriorating security situation in the region, as stated by colombian defence minister juan carlos pinzon.
this attack took place in an area where nine employees from an oil company were recently abducted, underscoring the ongoing threat posed by various illegal groups in arauca province.
despite the farc rebel group's recent announcement to cease kidnappings for ransom, other factions such as the eln and drug gangs persist in carrying out abductions in the area.
notably, incidents like the abduction of a 10-year-old girl last year in arauca province, suspected to be linked to the farc, illustrate the continued dangers posed by these armed groups.
the farc, active since the 1960s, has faced significant military setbacks and leadership losses, yet remains a formidable force capable of orchestrating attacks, fueled in part by proceeds from illicit drug activities.
the supreme court has announced its intentions to review an appellate ruling upholding bans on same-sex unions in four states, determining whether same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry nationwide.
the case is scheduled to be argued in april with a decision expected by late june.
among the 14 states where same-sex marriage is prohibited are kentucky, michigan, ohio, and tennessee.
the number of states permitting same-sex marriage has nearly doubled in the past three months due to federal and state court decisions.
in october, the justices' refusal to hear same-sex marriage appeals allowed several rulings to come into effect.
most recently, florida joined as the 36th state to grant marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

in addition to its primary functions, fermi has also been utilized by researchers to detect gamma ray bursts originating from the far side of the sun.
although previous identification of solar flares causing these bursts had been made, recent breakthroughs have provided imagery connections.
utilizing ultraviolet images from nasa's stereo satellites, scientists successfully linked the flares with the gamma rays emanating from the opposite side.
this correspondence indicates that particles had to traverse a distance of approximately 300,000 miles within 5 minutes, equating to a speed of 1,000 miles per second.
these discoveries are poised to enhance our comprehension of the universe.
the discovery of blazars may prompt a reevaluation of the formation of black holes, as scientists question how supermassive black holes came into existence so early in the universe's history.
concurrently, insights from solar flares are enhancing our understanding of solar activity.
although fermi is not an all-encompassing tool, the progress achieved since its launch in 2008 has been pivotal.
reuters photographer goran tomasevic recently revisited syria and has been documenting the hazardous conditions of damascus alongside the free syrian army.
in a particularly intense span of 24 hours, tomasevic was on the front lines as he followed an fsa unit on a combat operation.
witnessing the tragic death of a rebel who was fatally shot by a government sniper right before him, tomasevic courageously continued his work.
soon after, he faced another perilous moment as a tank shell struck a wall mere inches away from him and fellow fighters, showering them in debris.
through tomasevic's lens, the stark and immediate reality of the urban warfare in syria is vividly portrayed.
these chilling events unfolded just yesterday, underscoring the ongoing brutality of this enduring conflict.
arsenal's striker, nicklas bendtner, is determined to turn his personal fortunes around.
despite a strong finish to 2013, making his way back into the arsenal squad, 2014 has proven to be a challenging year for him.
starting positively with a crucial goal against cardiff city on new year's day, bendtner's progress was halted by an injury during the match.
this setback led to a decline in his career trajectory as he found himself sidelined in favor of younger striker yaya sanogo, who even started an important champions league game despite his lack of goals for the club.
bendtner faced criticism from manager arsene wenger for an unauthorized trip to denmark, attracting negative attention in the media.
his absence during arsenal's loss to everton was later explained through a tweet citing treatment for another injury.
however, bendtner is now intensifying his efforts to stage a comeback, as indicated in an instagram post where he shared completing a grueling eight-hour solo training session with a message highlighting his commitment and hard work.
the possibility of bendtner's return to play for arsenal this season remains uncertain, with only a few league matches left alongside an fa cup semi-final and potential final games.
although his playing time has been limited since the start of the year, arsene wenger has a history of surprising selections if he deems it necessary.
in addition to aiding his team in overcoming their struggles, bendtner has personal incentives to regain fitness.
with denmark not qualifying for the world cup, bendtner's contract with arsenal expiring in the summer necessitates him being in peak condition to attract potential suitors as a free agent.

since their narrow victory in 2015, the conservatives have encountered difficulties in pushing through additional austerity measures.
they found themselves unable to proceed with proposed reductions to tax credits and disability benefits, and philip hammond swiftly retracted the planned national insurance increase for self-employed individuals following the budget announcement.
now, with a hung parliament in place, it appears that the era of austerity is drawing to a close.
the conservatives, in need of the support of the dup to maintain their majority, face resistance from a party that has consistently rejected aggressive spending cuts.
the dup's manifesto advocates for the removal of the "bedroom tax" and the preservation of universal pensioner benefits, as well as the state pension "triple lock".
within the tory party itself, there are members who preach fiscal austerity in theory but hesitate to implement it in reality.
a considerable faction vehemently opposes any measures that would further diminish the quality of life for their constituents.
the repercussions from the recent election are viewed as a validation of this stance, as the notion of additional cuts is met with increasing apprehension.
britain's tolerance for austerity measures is waning after enduring seven years of such policies.
prime minister may's stark response to a nurse, expressing the absence of a "magic money tree" to lift the public sector pay cap, underscored the conservatives' dilemma.
the postponement of george osborne's budget surplus objective to 2025 has already weakened the momentum behind austerity efforts.
with a fragile majority, the brexit process, and an economic downturn looming, it appears that the drive for austerity will come to a standstill.
during the previous season, san antonio swingman danny green made the leap from the d-league to the nba.
instead of waiting through the ongoing nba lockout, green opted to join euroleague team union olimpija to steer clear of the uncertainties surrounding the league's situation.
despite having a non-guaranteed option in his contract with the spurs for the 2011-12 season, the indefinite lockout prompted the former second-round pick to secure a deal with the euroleague team in slovenia for the upcoming season.
with experience playing for the spurs, cleveland cavaliers, and various d-league teams like the erie bayhawks, austin toros, and reno bighorns, the former north carolina standout has participated in 28 nba games.
joining union olimpija means green will be teammates with fellow tarheel deon thompson, alongside former nba player damir markota and standout point guard ben woodside from north dakota state university.
green is among the latest nba players to opt for euroleague play this offseason.

last december, darwin, the monkey that escaped in a toronto, canada ikea car park, will not be returning to its owner.
ontario judge mary vallee has made a ruling stating that darwin is classified as a wild animal under canadian law, and therefore should be housed in a sanctuary, specifically the japanese macaque sanctuary.
despite the owner, yasmin nakhuda, attempting to sue on grounds that animal services deceived her into giving up custody of the pet, the court found in favor of the sanctuary retaining darwin.
the captivating images of the monkey clad in a tiny shearling coat and diaper quickly spread across the internet, attracting significant attention.
keeping monkeys like darwin is against the law in canada, and the court emphasized the legitimate concerns regarding the spread of diseases as a rationale for keeping the animal in custody.
judge vallee's ruling on friday determined that ms nakhuda had consented to the transfer of darwin to the story book farm primate sanctuary in sunderland, ontario without being unduly influenced, though she was visibly distressed.
ms nakhuda expressed her deep connection to the animal, revealing that darwin had essentially been a cherished member of her family and was ever-present, even accompanying her during sleep and shower times.
reflecting on the situation, she recounted her initial belief that it was in darwin's best interest, noting that the monkey would experience distress when separated from her.
rudi garcia will be present on the sidelines for the roma-milan match as his suspension has been lifted, while jose holebas also had his ban overturned.
the altercation between the two following roma's 1-0 win against genoa led to allegations against garcia for an attempted physical attack on a steward at marassi.
however, in a letter from genoa, the steward partly retracted his statement, prompting a detailed review of the incident by the disciplinary committee, resulting in the lifting of the touchline ban for both garcia and holebas.
holebas, in particular, had his one-match ban completely annulled on appeal, enabling his participation in the upcoming game against milan.
on a different note, genoa's plea to reduce striker diego perotti's three-match ban was unsuccessful.
after delving into the details of the riaa's lawsuit against jeffery howell, it appears that there is a misconception in the media reports.
contrary to what was initially believed, jeffery is not being sued for ripping cds; rather, the lawsuit stems from alleged illegal downloading.
what sets this case apart from previous ones is the riaa's bold move in categorizing mp3s ripped from legally owned cds as "unauthorized copies." this shift in strategy, although not new, is now being brought to the forefront.
the legality of ripping cds can be argued under the fair use doctrine, yet it has not been definitively ruled upon by a judge.
paradoxically, by pushing this issue to the courts, the riaa may be inadvertently risking a ruling that could go against their claims.
this turn of events highlights how being overly aggressive might not always yield the desired results.
in marawi, philippines, a government airstrike resulted in the tragic loss of ten soldiers and left eight wounded in a "friendly fire" incident.
defense secretary delfin lorenzana expressed regret over the incident that occurred during street battles between militants associated with the islamic state and the army, which have led to over 100 fatalities in the past week.
the clashes began after the army's attempt to apprehend a prominent militant leader sparked violence.
president rodrigo duterte declared martial law on mindanao island where marawi is situated following the raid aimed at capturing isnilon hapilon, a high-profile terror suspect.
the military's efforts to combat the militants have included armed forces and helicopter airstrikes with the goal of reclaiming control of the city, home to 200,000 residents.
although the majority of civilians have evacuated, around 2,000 individuals are still trapped.
recent reports from defense minister lorenzana revealed that among the militants killed, fighters from various nationalities such as saudi, yemeni, and chechen were identified.
russia's parliament is fast-tracking a constitutional amendment that may pave the way for vladimir putin's return to the presidency in a matter of weeks.
amid apparent unease in the kremlin, the state duma announced it would convene today to expedite legislation that could potentially reinstate mr.
putin as the country's president for a maximum of 12 years.
straying from the norm, the bill will undergo all three readings in a single session rather than being spread out over several weeks or months.
the proposal, put forth by dmitry medvedev, seeks to extend the presidential term limit from two consecutive four-year terms to two consecutive six-year terms.
after stepping down in may due to existing constitutional constraints, mr.
putin assumed the role of prime minister, not straying too far from the political spotlight.

during an inquiry, it was revealed that officials from greyhound racing nsw declined to provide information to the rspca, which could have aided in identifying individuals suspected of participating in live baiting.
privacy concerns were cited as the reason for their refusal.
according to testimony at the special commission into greyhound racing, a valuable diary was confiscated during a raid in february 2015 at the premises of an unnamed trainer in western sydney, who was believed to be using live animals for greyhound training.
david o'shannessy, the chief inspector of the rspca, informed the commission that the diary contained significant information, including christian names and phone numbers.
despite the rspca's request for assistance in identifying the individuals listed in the diary, greyhound racing nsw insisted on the issuance of a formal notice for the production of information before complying.
numerous studies have indicated the significant financial impact of compulsive buying behaviors, often resulting in substantial levels of debt for individuals affected.
the accessibility of credit cards facilitates impulsive purchases, enabling individuals to fulfill their buying urges promptly.
in a pair of online experiments, it was observed that compulsive shoppers frequently exceeded their budgets and were less influenced by price considerations.
their excessive spending habits were found to be linked to their heavy reliance on credit cards.
additionally, compulsive shoppers tended to be less vigilant about adhering to their budgets, particularly when using credit cards.
moreover, they experienced heightened satisfaction upon completing shopping excursions and were more distressed by delayed product deliveries compared to regular shoppers.
notably, in a cross-cultural context, compulsive shoppers in taiwan exhibited a higher prevalence of compulsive buying tendencies compared to those in the united kingdom, showcasing a more pronounced manifestation of the aforementioned compulsive buying behaviors.

rumor has it that xbox 360 may be incorporating free-to-play games into xbox live next year, allowing developers to utilize micro-transaction revenue models.
this shift in the gaming landscape is mirroring the popular pc trend and is poised to make its way to the xbox 360.
according to an undisclosed ign source, microsoft's plan to introduce free-to-play games is on the horizon.
although initially intended for the casual racer joy ride before its transformation into a kinect launch title, this sales model enables players to access games for free while offering in-game purchases for cosmetic or game-altering items through micro-transactions.
this approach, already widespread in massively multiplayer online games and facebook titles like farmville, has attracted the attention of major publishers like ea, who have experimented with titles such as battlefield heroes and battlefield play4free.
sony has also dipped into this realm by launching free realms on the playstation 3 in march, preceding microsoft's potential move.
while these developments remain in the realm of speculation, the gaming community eagerly awaits potential confirmation, with e3 being a likely platform for microsoft to make official announcements given its audience of game enthusiasts, investors, and developers.

the young turks stands out as the largest online news organization globally, esteemed for its credibility in delivering news.
the free media remains an essential component of upholding the checks and balances in our system.

the football federation australia faces a serious threat as various australian stakeholders are rallying together.
in a series of lengthy meetings with fifa and the asian football confederation, efforts were made to resolve the political deadlock in australian football by negotiating a new ffa congress on terms favored by the key australian stakeholders.
ffa chief david gallop and chairman steven lowy are in constant communication with fifa to update them on the progress.
a-league club owners, state member federations, the pfa, and national premier league clubs are inching towards a resolution that could reshape the ffa congress as early as thursday.
however, there are concerns that by doing so, these parties are pushing ffa out of the negotiations.
while this approach could potentially prevent fifa from further interfering in australian football governance, it might also make steven lowy's position as ffa chairman increasingly untenable if the other parties align against him.
leicester city manager nigel pearson is actively seeking loan agreements for arsenal's young talents nico yennaris and ignasi miquel.

air marshal leo davies, the chief of air force, revealed the raaf's inclination towards closing richmond and laverton, emphasizing that this decision is part of a larger strategy yet to be presented to the government.
despite indicators that richmond, in particular, would require substantial investment to remain operational, defence minister marise payne affirmed that the government is not currently contemplating the closure of either base.

lake county sheriff's spokesperson fred jones disclosed on thursday that melvin kort's daughters admitted to the burial.

following a dry spell lasting one to two months in the southern us, regions have recently experienced unprecedented levels of rainfall.
in late november, heavy showers drenched various areas, with tennessee, which had been devastated by wildfires, receiving up to 125mm of rain.
texas, on the other hand, is facing fewer concerns regarding drought.
typically, the southern part of the state receives up to 100mm of rain in december.
however, galveston, a coastal city, shattered records this december when a remarkable 161mm of rain fell in a single day.
galveston county reported rainfall exceeding 250mm, resulting in extensive flooding that rendered roads impassable, especially in the northern parts of the city.
in response, shelters were set up for those temporarily displaced by the floods.
despite the disruption caused by the floods, substantially more rainfall is required to alleviate the drought conditions in the region.
numerous states, including eastern tennessee, southwestern north carolina, northwestern south carolina, northern georgia, northern alabama, and east-central mississippi, are facing rainfall deficits ranging from 200 to 375mm.
however, there is hope that this deficit may decrease in the upcoming days as the low-pressure system, responsible for the recent rains, moves slowly eastward.
this system is expected to revive a frontal boundary running east to west, bringing in more moist air from the gulf of mexico.
in the next few days, these states could witness between 50 and 125mm of additional rainfall until tuesday.
the memory layout and memory protection features of trezor are crucial aspects to consider.
trezor is powered by an stm32f205ret mcu, which incorporates various peripherals such as gpio, spi, usb, and flash on die.
given this hardware infrastructure, the device connects to trezor's buttons, oled screen, usb for power and data, as well as the storage of firmware, bootloader, and metadata - including private key material.
the flash memory is organized into distinct sections: 32k allocated for the bootloader, another 32k for metadata storage, and 448k reserved for the firmware.
upon powering up trezor, the bootloader is initiated to set up the hardware and authenticate the firmware by verifying its signature against an embedded signature within the bootloader.
if the signature matches, control seamlessly transitions to the firmware; otherwise, the user is prompted with a warning indicating that the firmware is not official, requiring user validation before the firmware is executed.
importantly, the memory location housing the bootloader is write-protected, ensuring the bootloader's signature validation cannot be altered - a crucial security measure to warn against the potential insertion of malicious firmware without the user's awareness.
while this mechanism effectively notifies users of unauthorized firmware, it poses challenges when users seek to run self-compiled firmware.
in such instances, despite acknowledging the 'unofficial' warning and proceeding with execution by selecting 'ok,' users lack unequivocal assurance that trezor is running the intended firmware, raising concerns about potential infiltration of malicious firmware.
this delineates the imperative need for heightened security measures to ensure firmware integrity and user protection without compromising usability.
during a recent hectic night of champions league football, jose mourinho made a surprise appearance at craven cottage to witness fulham's 1-1 draw against rotherham united, despite his former club porto also in the limelight that european evening.
mourinho's presence wasn't merely to enjoy a match at his local championship club; he had a keen interest in fulham's goalkeeper, marcus bettinelli.
chelsea's manager is actively considering bettinelli as a potential second-choice goalkeeper after thibaut courtois, amidst the imminent departure of petr cech.
with just one year remaining on his contract at fulham, bettinelli is a prime target for chelsea, as mourinho prefers a younger option over elder statesmen like robert green or brad friedel.
at only 21 and hailing from camberwell, south london, bettinelli, an england under-21 international, has caught mourinho's eye since his debut for fulham last august.
notably, bettinelli's father, vic bettinelli, serves as the academy goalkeeping coach at fulham, providing an additional connection for mourinho, who also closely monitors his own son jose mario, a goalkeeper on fulham's youth team.

according to kansas education commissioner randy watson, the state must increase the number of students obtaining college degrees or vocational certificates to stay competitive in the evolving economy.
watson referred to a national study predicting that 72 percent of the future jobs in kansas will require some form of post-secondary education by 2020.
based on data from the national student clearinghouse, it was revealed that only approximately 65 percent of high school graduates in kansas in 2010 pursued higher education the subsequent year.
furthermore, less than 40 percent of these graduates had completed a degree or training certification six years after their graduation.
watson addressed the joint meeting of the kansas senate and house education committees last week, highlighting the importance of this issue as they work on developing a new school funding formula.
in detroit, there has been a recent increase in the number of bike shops and repair shops.

officials have reported the death of a suicide bomber in an attack aimed at the historic karnak temple in luxor, a southern city in egypt.
this incident marks the second assault in slightly over a week targeting egypt's crucial tourism sector.
another attacker was fatally shot by authorities during the confrontation on wednesday, while a third assailant was apprehended, resulting in a single police officer sustaining injuries.
fortunately, no civilians were harmed in the attack.
luxor, renowned for its ancient attractions, is a popular destination for both egyptian and international tourists.
images captured from the explosion site depicted scattered body parts near a tourist shop and a public restroom.
law enforcement officials disclosed that they had thwarted two previous suicide attempts targeting the nile-front temple, a prominent tourist hotspot that competes with the giza pyramids.
in response to the escalating threats, antiquities minister mamdouh al-damaty, in collaboration with the interior ministry, has mandated the reinforcement of security measures at historical sites nationwide.
the karnak complex, an expansive outdoor museum and the world's second-largest ancient religious site after cambodia's angkor wat temple, is considered egypt's second most visited historical venue after the giza pyramids.

according to cbs sports' bruce feldman, there is growing speculation about bobby petrino potentially taking on the role of head coach for the arkansas state red wolves.
after gus malzahn's departure to the auburn tigers, petrino apparently reached out to arkansas state about the vacant position.
should petrino assume the coaching responsibilities for the red wolves in the upcoming season, he will be leading a team that ended the regular season at 9-3 and secured the sun belt conference championship.
petrino's coaching history includes a successful tenure at arkansas where he achieved an 11-2 season before being dismissed in 2011.
prior to his time at arkansas, petrino coached at louisville, guiding the cardinals to two seasons with 11 or more wins.
he also briefly coached the atlanta falcons in 2007 before departing for the arkansas coaching position.

viewers expressed concerns about nick robinson's coverage of the scottish first minister's press conference, specifically in relation to the perception that alex salmond had not adequately responded to a question.
in response, bbc news clarified that robinson posed two inquiries during the event on september 11th: one regarding the tax implications of rbs relocating its legal headquarters to london, and the other questioning why voters should trust a politician over businessmen.
while the report emphasized salmond's silence on the trust issue, it acknowledged that his extensive response to the tax query could not be fully included due to time constraints.
clips highlighting salmond's key points on the job implications of rbs's relocation, accusations against the treasury, and a call for a bbc inquiry were included.
the bbc defended the validity of the questions posed by robinson and maintained that the report adhered to editorial standards of balance and impartiality.
during a visit to israel, mitt romney is aiming to appeal to a small yet influential segment of the american electorate.
concurrently, president barack obama is engaging in a similar effort domestically.
while romney's international tour may not significantly alter the overall course of the campaign against obama, he is concentrating on narrowing the gap among jewish voters.
although his campaign does not expect to secure a majority of jewish votes, romney is focused on weakening obama's support in this demographic.
particularly in florida, where jewish voters constitute approximately 4 percent of the electorate, romney seeks to strengthen his position.
however, studies among american jews reveal that only 6 percent prioritize israel as their main concern.
additionally, romney aims to reinforce his connection with republican evangelical christians during this trip.
a man and a woman, dressed up as a creepy clown duo, are now facing child neglect charges after allegedly leaving their 4-year-old child unattended at home while they engaged in frightening antics in a wisconsin neighborhood, according to police reports.
the city of menasha police responded to distress calls in the early hours of october 7, reporting individuals in clown attire chasing cars.
an officer's dashcam footage captured the confrontation with the two suspects, aged 20 and 29, implicated in the incident.
additionally, the officers located the female driver, 26, associated with the clown pair, parked nearby.
while the individuals were not specifically charged for wearing clown costumes, the 29-year-old man and 26-year-old woman were arrested when it was discovered that they had allegedly abandoned their young child at home for an extended period during the clown escapade.
the department of human services intervened and placed the child in alternative care.
both parents are now facing child neglect charges in court, with the woman also being detained in winnebago county jail due to a probation hold.
the 20-year-old man was not held accountable in relation to the incident.

a significant explosion occurred at a chemical facility in ritterhude near bremen in north-western germany, causing damage to a nearby residential area and being audible for miles around.
the incident, which took place on tuesday night, resulted in injuries to several individuals, with one person sustaining severe burns.
the blast also caused harm to the surrounding residential area in ritterhude, located within the verden-osterholz county.
emergency responders discovered the severely injured man amidst the debris, and a few local residents suffered minor injuries, according to reports from police and firefighters.
the explosion, which transpired at 9pm, triggered a large fire and generated a loud noise that reverberated across the area.
marcus neumann, the spokesperson for the verden-osterholz police, indicated that the injured individual is suspected to be a plant employee, given that his vehicle was found parked outside the facility.
neumann mentioned that the employee apparently rushed to the plant upon receiving an alert on his pager.
the exact cause of the explosion remains under investigation, as the site is still too hot for authorities to access.
the facility, which is operated by organo fluid gmbh and specializes in the recovery of valuable solvents from used mixtures, was affected by the explosion.
demjanjuk, born in ukraine in 1920, garnered international attention in 1977 when he faced accusations of being ivan the terrible, a cruel guard at the treblinka death camp.
despite losing the us citizenship he acquired after relocating to the states in the 1940s, he was extradited to israel, where survivors of treblinka presented haunting testimonies during his trial.
in a turn of events in 1993, the israeli supreme court overturned his conviction, attributing it to mistaken identity.
however, demjanjuk's past resurfaced when new claims emerged of his service as an ss guard at sobibor, majdanek, and flossenburg camps.
in 2008, the german federal prosecutor requested his extradition from the united states.
subsequently, in may 2009, despite numerous legal appeals to remain in the usa, demjanjuk was transported to germany, where he faced allegations of contributing to the deaths of a minimum of 28,000 individuals at sobibor.
during his trial, his defense centered on the argument that his prisoner of war status during the war rendered him incapable of serving as a camp guard.
additionally, his legal team contended that the absence of living witnesses who could identify him as a sobibor guard rendered the accusations lacking substantial evidence of his culpability.

newcastle is reportedly in advanced discussions with rafa benitez to take over from current head coach steve mcclaren, who is expected to be dismissed as per sky sources.
it is understood that mcclaren will be relieved of his duties before the monday night football match against leicester, paving the way for benitez to assume control.
discussions are underway for benitez to sign a three-year contract and have the freedom to appoint his own backroom staff at st james' park.
recent reports suggest that newcastle has approached benitez to manage the team, signaling a departure from their previous policy of appointing a head coach.
in mcclaren's absence, first-team coaches ian cathro and peter beardsley might step in for the leicester game.
although mcclaren was at the training complex on thursday as usual, engaging with the squad for their upcoming fixture against the league leaders, he reportedly had a phone conversation with managing director lee charnley on wednesday without an in-person meeting.
mcclaren did not address the media ahead of the match at the king power stadium and was scheduled to have further talks with charnley after training.
following newcastle's recent defeat to bournemouth, which was their fifth loss in six matches, they currently sit in 19th place on the premier league table.

given google's vast repository of user data and search histories, there arises a question of whether the company could leverage its technological capabilities to detect and prevent terrorist activities and mass violence preemptively.
notably, norwegian newspaper dagbladet disclosed that prior to his violent acts, terrorist anders breivik spent a significant amount of time, around 200 days, searching google for topics like "how to make a bomb." while google already utilizes search data to enhance targeted advertising, refine search results, and monitor disease outbreaks like the flu, an academic platform called the conversation raised the pertinent inquiry of why google didn't intercept the norway attacker.
in response to this, craig wright, a computer science lecturer at charles sturt university, predicted a potential uptick in calls across european countries for search engines to monitor user behavior post such catastrophic events.
a kenyan man, james kimondo, has taken legal action against activists who proposed a week-long sex boycott for women in protest against the political deadlock in the country.
kimondo stated outside the nairobi high court that his wife participated in the boycott, causing him feelings of anxiety and sleepless nights.
he expressed experiencing mental distress, stress, back pains, and difficulty in focusing due to the situation.
the scale of the participation in the strike, which concluded on wednesday, remains undisclosed.
the women's development organisation initiated the call to pressure political leaders to prioritize the nation's welfare over their disputes.
the wife of kenyan prime minister raila odinga supported the initiative, highlighting the leaders' negligence towards the public's needs.
during the court proceedings on friday, kimondo, represented by his lawyer, accused his wife, teresia wanjiku, of withholding conjugal rights, leading him to seek unspecified damages for the emotional strain caused by the interference with his marriage.
reports from kenyan broadcaster kbc suggest that kimondo is pursuing "general damages" from the boycott organizers.

in this capacity, he will focus on identifying weaknesses in opposing defenses.
this marks a departure for mangini, traditionally known as a defensive coach due to his time with bill belichick in new england, although he does have experience on the offensive side in his coaching career.

fascinating study titled "what you see is what they get: protecting users from unwanted use of microphones, cameras, and other sensors," authored by jon howell and stuart schechter, delves into the privacy concerns surrounding sensors like cameras and microphones that gather data without user consent.
existing sensor access protocols tend to inconvenience users by either prompting them to grant access to applications or allowing access without permission.
consequently, applications can continue to collect sensor data even when the user believes access has been revoked.
the authors proposed the use of a sensor-access widget within the application's interface to visualize the data being collected by each sensor in real-time, drawing attention to the data collection process.
this widget not only displays whether the sensor data is currently accessible to the application but also serves as a control panel for users to manage sensor configurations and authorize or deny access.
by integrating this continuous disclosure mechanism into the platform, the sensor-access widgets present a novel approach to access control, alleviating the inherent conflict between user privacy concerns and application convenience.
his abusive behavior spanned nearly a decade before authorities in britain became aware of his actions in mid-2014.
a tip from australia regarding his activities on the dark web led the nca to collaborate with authorities in malaysia.
however, due to jurisdictional challenges, they were unable to take action while he was abroad.
the situation changed when it was discovered that he would be returning to britain for christmas.
consequently, he was apprehended on december 19, 2014, upon his arrival at gatwick airport.
a disturbing aspect of the case was huckle's insistence on viewing the online materials depicting his abuses before he eventually admitted guilt.
upon examining his laptop, camera, and phone, investigators found over 20,000 indecent images of minors, several depicting huckle engaging in these crimes.
prosecutors invoked section 72 of the sexual offences act, which permits the prosecution of uk nationals for offenses committed overseas.
following his arrest, his parents confronted him about the accusations, leading huckle to admit to them that he was a paedophile.
this revelation left his mother distraught, prompting his father, who is an engineer, to alert the authorities about his son's admission.
a terrorism suspect referred to as sabir k, a 26-year-old dutch citizen of pakistani descent, has had his extradition to the united states halted by a dutch court.
the court expressed apprehension about potential american involvement in his alleged torture.
sabir k is accused of participating in attacks against us troops in afghanistan.
he claims to have been subjected to torture in pakistan following his arrest in 2010, with allegations that the us was aware of the situation.
the extradition request was turned down by the judge due to ambiguities surrounding the extent of us complicity.
sabir k was brought back to the netherlands after his detention and promptly arrested.
his lawyer, andre seebregts, informed the bbc that while he is now free to remain in the netherlands, he risks re-arrest if he travels abroad.
the ruling is noteworthy as it suggests a recognition of potential us knowledge of overseas torture techniques employed against suspects, a subject on which washington has traditionally declined to comment.
the dutch government retains the option to pursue a final appeal to the nation's supreme court.

on friday, the aap lodged a complaint accusing defence minister manohar parrikar and bjp spokesperson gvl narsimharao of "sedition" regarding their recent statements on the armed forces.
dilip pandey, aap's delhi unit convenor, penned a letter to the ip estate police station alleging that their remarks were not only disrespectful but also intended to create disapproval towards the armed forces.
during an event in dehradun on october 1, parrikar referenced the ramayana, likening indian troops to hanuman, illustrating their underestimated capabilities before the surgical strikes.
the aap further criticized narsimharao's assertion that the army had only recently become aware of its strength, considering it a slight against the military and its sacrifices.

bontrager, 29, was subsequently charged with felony burglary of an occupied dwelling following his arrest on saturday morning.
upon waking up at approximately 7:20 am, a sarasota resident discovered bontrager snoozing on her living room couch.

steve bannon, the nationalist figure who played a significant role in propelling donald trump to the presidency, is departing from his position as white house chief strategist.
white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders confirmed bannon's exit in a statement, attributing it to a mutual agreement between bannon and white house chief of staff john kelly.
the news of bannon's departure had a positive impact on the stock markets, leading to visible excitement among traders on the new york stock exchange.
bannon had clashed with other administration officials, particularly former goldman sachs executive gary cohn, which had caused concerns among investors.
according to a source close to bannon cited by the new york times, bannon had made the decision to leave prior to formally resigning on aug.
delays in announcing bannon's departure were connected to the aftermath of the charlottesville incident.
reports indicated that trump and his team were considering the best approach to inform the public about bannon's exit.
chief of staff kelly had been evaluating bannon's role within the administration, characterized by his championing of populist nationalist ideals that sparked debates over his suitability for a senior position.
intel has publicly disclosed its intention to launch an internet-based tv service, but key details are still uncertain, including the potential name.
investigative work by gigaom indicates that the service could potentially be named oncue.
a shell company linked to intel, sest, has filed trademarks for oncue along with a logo and the slogan "tv has come to its senses." furthermore, an employee at omd, a marketing agency, has suggested involvement in the oncue launch.
intel has refrained from commenting on these findings, hinting at a cautious approach towards their entry into the internet tv market.
it's possible that the trademarks might not align with an actual product launch, leaving a question mark on whether the names will materialize further than just branding.
cat owners residing near areas housing endangered species may face restrictions on allowing their cats outdoors, as the government targets their potential impact on wildlife.
gregory andrews, australia's inaugural threatened species commissioner, advocates for cats to be kept indoors around the clock to enhance their well-being, prevent harm to native fauna, and aid in controlling feral cat populations.
while some jurisdictions have already introduced this regulation, a veterinarian advises caution due to potential health and behavioral implications.
the government's recent feral cat management plan, aimed at culling 2 million feral cats, has sparked controversy worldwide, with criticism from prominent figures such as french actress brigitte bardot.
further revelations regarding ynw melly's murder case have surfaced, and they are indeed troubling.
according to a report from tmz, the florida rapper is accused of devising a plan to deceive law enforcement into believing that his slain friends fell victim to a drive-by shooting.
the report states that melly's associate, cortlen henry, initially alerted authorities to the tragedy on oct.
26 when he arrived at the emergency room seeking help for his two friends who had been shot in what he claimed was a drive-by incident.
the two victims, anthony williams and christopher thomas, were declared dead upon reaching the hospital.
during questioning, henry recounted a scenario where he and the deceased individuals had just finished a studio session and were targeted by an unknown vehicle that allegedly fired shots as they traveled on the freeway.
the police investigation, however, uncovered inconsistencies in henry's narrative.
forensic evidence indicated that gunshots were discharged from inside the car, with shell casings suggesting that the initial shot originated from the left rear passenger seat where ynw melly was seated at the time.
despite henry's assertion that melly exited the car before the shooting, surveillance footage reportedly shows both melly and henry entering the vehicle with the victims.
law enforcement alleges that the staged "drive-by" plan was concocted after melly and henry drove around with the deceased bodies in the vehicle.
both ynw melly and henry now face two charges of first-degree murder in connection with the case.

a recent breakthrough featured in the journal nature showcases the innovative material developed by researchers in the united states, enabling the creation of holographs within minutes.
the material has the capability to capture images that are nearly as clear as those seen on american television broadcasts.
what sets this polymer apart is its potential to be transformed into large screens, presenting a wide range of opportunities for utilizing 3d images.
traditionally, the complexities involved in producing holographs have constrained their application to specialized domains.
however, the introduction of the photorefractive polymer by savas tay and his team at the university of arizona in tucson has the prospect of overcoming these limitations by streamlining the holograph production process.
typically, holographs are produced by merging laser light reflections with a secondary laser beam to imprint a static image—a method known for its intricate and time-consuming nature.
the pioneering material, utilizing lasers, facilitates the embedding of images within the holographic medium, demonstrating stability across numerous write and erase cycles.
the swift refresh rate of images in holographs suggests promising applications such as aiding surgeons in operations or enhancing pharmaceutical research on molecular interactions for new drugs through simulations.
the team has automated the image capture, writing, and erasing processes via a sophisticated system capable of interpreting data from various sources such as mri scans, cat scans, satellite imagery, aerial photographs, and microscopes.
although the team has currently produced only a modest 10cm by 10cm screen in collaboration with advanced technology company nitto denko, they envision no boundaries in terms of display size scalability, affirming that large thin-film devices can be fabricated and seamlessly interconnected to create expansive displays.

turkish riot police deployed tear gas and water cannon to disperse protesters attempting to breach a barricade surrounding gezi park in istanbul.
the park, situated close to taksim square, had been a focal point of disturbances the previous month.
the demonstrations initially ignited against the proposed redevelopment of the park but soon escalated into a nationwide movement challenging the leadership of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan.
law enforcement forcibly removed protesters occupying the park on june 15.
the government's redevelopment scheme, which aimed to replace the park with a replica of an ottoman-era military barracks, was nullified by an administrative court ruling citing no public benefit in the project.
it is uncertain whether the government will contest this decision.
despite activists' call for a march to reclaim the park, the area remained inaccessible due to police cordons.
in a stern warning issued by the istanbul governor, demonstrators were cautioned against attempting to breach the barrier.
the violent clashes during the month-long series of protests in turkey claimed five lives and left thousands injured, marking the most severe unrest witnessed during erdogan's decade-long tenure.
protesters accused the pm of exhibiting authoritarian tendencies and seeking to enforce conservative islamic principles in a secular nation.
deirdre magolon, a 20-year-old woman, has been missing from montgomery county, pennsylvania for three days following an alleged breakdown of her car on the side of the road.
she was last seen leaving her royersford home between 6:40 and 7 pm on friday.
magolon's 2005 black mazda was discovered abandoned on eastbound route 422 near king of prussia at 11:30 pm that same night, approximately a 20-minute drive from her residence.
family members suspect her car broke down as she did not have a phone with her.
magolon, described as 5-foot-5 with blonde hair and blue eyes, was last seen in a gray furry hooded jacket.
authorities are searching for her as there has been no trace of her whereabouts since she went missing, according to upper providence township police.
opinions on marijuana vary widely, with some viewing it as a dangerous substance that should remain illegal like heroin and pcp, while others hail it as a valuable medicinal herb unjustly restricted by the government.
many believe it falls somewhere in between, acknowledging its potential medical applications alongside its associated risks.
while debates continue, a dedicated group of researchers persists in studying the use of inhaled marijuana for addressing pain, nausea, and muscle spasms.
they emphasize that all drugs, even common over-the-counter medications like aspirin and antihistamines, carry risks that must be weighed against potential benefits.
advocates argue that marijuana shows promise in treating conditions like chronic pain, cancer pain, multiple sclerosis, aids wasting syndrome, and chemotherapy-induced nausea.
they contend that the true medical benefits of marijuana are being hindered by limited understanding and utilization.
furthermore, they assert that research indicates the risks associated with marijuana use, though present, are generally modest and well-documented.
atlanta falcons wide receiver julio jones returned to the practice field on friday after missing sessions earlier in the week due to a hamstring and toe injury, as reported by espn's vaughn mcclure.
his participation in friday's practice suggests that he is on track to play on sunday, although he may still carry a "questionable" designation.
despite dealing with physical setbacks, jones continues to dominate the league with impressive stats, including being on pace to break records with 181 catches, 2,346 yards, and 21 touchdowns over a full season.
fantasy implications indicate that while jones has been a standout performer, his workload may prompt the falcons to involve other receivers to lighten his load.
nevertheless, if jones is active on game day, fantasy managers should confidently start him given his consistent elite performance.
in the event that jones is unable to play, leonard hankerson is expected to step in, although the likelihood of this scenario has decreased with jones' return to practice on friday.
fox sports announced that they will exclude live anthem coverage from all games except for the london matchup between the miami dolphins and new orleans saints.
in a recent broadcast, the network showcased the national anthem as over 250 players knelt in protest against president trump's remarks urging the dismissal of nfl players for allegedly disrespecting the flag.
notably, the tennessee titans and seattle seahawks remained in their locker rooms during the anthem.
fox clarified their stance by stating that they will televise both the national anthem and god save the queen during the london game, while other games airing on fox this sunday will not feature the anthem live.
however, fox assured viewers that their cameras will capture and present the reactions of players and coaches on the field during the anthem.

the act brumbies have expressed their support for stephen moore's potential as the next wallabies captain.
coach stephen larkham praised the 91-test hooker, stating that he is the ideal candidate to lead australia to a successful world cup campaign next year.
moore is expected to be announced as the new wallabies captain on monday, ahead of the team's upcoming three-test series against france and the preparations for the world cup in england.
moore is set to face the rebels' pack on saturday night.
outgoing test captain ben mowen mentioned feeling "insanely jealous" as the wallabies prepare for their series opener in brisbane, but he stated that he is content with his decision to step down from the role and pursue his career in france at the end of the year.
with nearly a decade of experience in test rugby, the highly respected moore is finally getting the opportunity to lead the wallabies, a role that larkham believes he is well-suited for at the age of 31.
lil wayne's recent ventures into advertising have been quite intriguing.
from his perplexing super bowl 50 commercial featuring george washington that still has us puzzled, to his memorable mountain dew ads from a few years back.
now, samsung has chosen tunechi as the face of their latest phone, the galaxy s7, in a series of humorous commercials.
in one ad, we see lil wayne casually assisting in the delivery of a baby elephant while chilling on a couch next to wesley snipes.
another spot shows wayne sipping tea, battling robots in space, going canoeing with snipes, and catching waves in thailand.
there's also a memorable scene where he nonchalantly drops a full bottle of champagne on his phone and submerges it in a fish tank to showcase its waterproof capabilities, leaving his friend with a competitor's phone in a less enviable situation.
inter milan clinched the fourth spot in serie a this season with a 2-1 victory over empoli at san siro.
the match saw all three goals scored in the first half, with mauro icardi netting his 16th goal of the season before ivan perisic responded to manuel pucciarelli's equalizer.
roberto mancini's side now holds a seven-point lead over fiorentina, securing their place in the europa league.
meanwhile, in another match, ac milan moved back to sixth place after carlos bacca's first-half penalty secured a narrow 1-0 win over 10-man bologna.
the victory was crucial for ac milan as they aimed to reclaim their european spot after being overtaken by sassuolo.
bologna's disadvantage, due to amadou diawara's red card and angelo da costa's foul, allowed bacca to convert the penalty and seal the victory.
sassuolo will have a chance to reclaim the sixth spot with a win over frosinone on sunday.
early thursday morning in a manalapan neighborhood, several properties were found defaced with swastikas and hate speech spray-painted in red, as reported by the anti-defamation league.
among the vandalized locations was a white-picket fence in the monmouth heights neighborhood bearing the words "kill the jews," while swastikas were found on 10 to 15 objects including cars, electrical boxes, and houses.
the adl new jersey community director, jeffrey salkin, expressed condemnation for the incident and stated the organization's sadness.
he highlighted the significance of the swastika as a universal symbol of hate used for instilling fear and intimidation, indicating that the perpetrators aimed to deliver a message to the entire community.
following the incident, monmouth county police and the monmouth county prosecutor's office initiated an investigation.
notably, the jewish federation of monmouth county had coincidentally conducted a security workshop the night before in preparation for the upcoming yom kippur and rosh hashanah gatherings that are expected to draw thousands of people to local synagogues.
keith krivitzky, the executive director at the jewish federation, mentioned plans for heightened security measures in light of the recent vandalism.
efforts to obtain comments from the police department and prosecutor's office were unsuccessful on thursday afternoon.
according to reuters, there are just 10 albino redwoods worldwide, with one facing the threat of being cut down to pave the way for a new commuter rail system.
the endangered 52-foot albino chimera coast redwood in cotati, california, is located a mere 12 feet from the planned construction site of the sonoma-marin area rail transit line set to commence next month.
arborist tom stapleton stressed to reuters the significance of preserving this tree, emphasizing its crucial importance in the study of albinism in redwoods.
a mere 200 of these white-needle evergreens are currently known to exist globally, all within california.
the rarity of this particular redwood lies in its unique genetic composition, as an albino chimera coast redwood with two sets of dna resulting in its multicolored needles.
referred to as the "phantoms of the forest," by expert sandy lydon, these trees are exceptionally rare and treasured in northern california.
efforts are underway by local arborists to challenge city authorities and the rail agency to secure the survival of this extraordinary "phantom of the forest" and prevent it from fading into extinction.

in the early 20th century, the perception of russian icons underwent a transformative shift as restorers developed techniques to remove layers of grime and soot accumulated over centuries.
previously viewed as ancient and somber art, the icons revealed their true brilliance and vibrancy once cleansed of the encrusted dirt and varnish.
the luminous quality of the paintings symbolizes the spiritual realm and divine light, with the radiant golden backgrounds representing the splendor of the heavenly kingdom devoid of darkness.
the use of gold in depicting the garments of christ, the virgin mary, and the saints signifies their sacredness.
while at times yellow paint was utilized as a substitute for gold, the symbolic significance remained unchanged.
noteworthy examples include the depiction of archangel michael from the late 13th century and the iconic portrayal of saint george from the yuriev monastery in novgorod, dated back to the 11th and 12th centuries.
melvyn bragg and his guests explore the origins and consequences of the highest global temperatures in the past 65 million years, highlighting a period when arctic sea surfaces reached temperatures of up to 23 degrees celsius for approximately 100,000 years.
they delve into the elevated temperatures that signified the conclusion of the paleocene era and the commencement of the eocene epoch around 50 million years ago.
across a span of around 1,000 years, the earth experienced a notable average temperature increase of over 5 degrees celsius, maintaining this heightened level for around 100,000 years.
during this time, arctic sea surfaces warmed to levels akin to those found in the subtropics, leading to extensive extinctions, alterations in oceanic currents, and decreased oxygen levels in deep-sea environments.
the escalation in temperatures has been linked to elevated concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere, although the specific sources of these gases remain undetermined.
one prevailing hypothesis suggests that a surge in carbon dioxide, potentially due to volcanic activity, facilitated a planetary warming that enabled warm water to penetrate deeper ocean layers, subsequently triggering the release of methane from frozen crystals on the seabed.
as temperatures continued to rise and warm conditions persisted, the release of methane intensified.
scientists have conducted comprehensive studies utilizing a range of sources from this extended epoch, including ice samples and fossils, in an ongoing effort to elucidate the underlying causes.
the discussion features dame jane francis, professor of palaeoclimatology at the british antarctic survey; mark maslin, professor of palaeoclimatology at university college london; and tracy aze, lecturer in marine micropaleontology at the university of leeds.
the episode was produced by simon tillotson.
when questioned about his treatment by mr.
rudd casually dismissed it, stating, "in terms of his perspectives and his efforts to have mr.
abbott elected as prime minister and to end my tenure, it's a democratic country." however, on wednesday evening, mr.
rudd escalated the situation by urging mr.
abbott to be transparent about any conversations he may have had with mr.
abbott's nbn policy was launched at the fox studios in sydney, which led him to inquire about the nature of their discussions concerning australia's national broadband network.
additionally, a comment piece by paul sheehan in fairfax newspapers over the weekend suggested that news corp, under mr.
murdoch, was opposing the government because it perceived labor's nbn as a threat to its foxtel subscription television network.
middlesbrough's ongoing summer of transformations is poised to witness a player exchange before saturday's clash against sheffield united.
marten de roon, the dutch midfielder, has received approval to finalize his return to atalanta, with boro agreeing to a 15 million euro offer.
garry monk's squad is preparing to fill de roon's position with chelsea midfielder lewis baker, who is expected to arrive on a two-year loan deal.
baker, aged 22, has previously played for sheffield wednesday, mk dons, and vitesse, and has been permitted by chelsea to pursue another extended loan opportunity at teesside.
meeting monk's requirement for young and ambitious players, baker is seen as a suitable addition.
the outgoing transfer of de roon, who joined middlesbrough from serie a a year ago for 10 million euros, is set to generate a profit for the club.
despite attracting interest from various clubs including watford and even manchester united, atalanta has emerged as the frontrunner for his signing, as negotiations reach a conclusion for his return to the team where he first gained prominence.
monk continues to seek further reinforcements for his squad and remains interested in acquiring birmingham defender ryan shotton as the transfer window nears its end.
today, on thursday, may 5, 2011, while many acknowledge it as the national day of prayer, i am writing to bring attention to it as the 2011 national day of reason.
since its inception in 2003, the national day of reason has been observed by millions both in the united states and globally.
this day is a celebration of the importance of reason and its positive influence on society.
by promoting rational thinking and discourse, we can enhance the quality of life worldwide and foster intelligent, ethical, and moral interactions among individuals.
reason has played a pivotal role in the success of our nation.
the principles outlined in the constitution of the united states draw from the philosophical foundations laid during the age of reason.
they emphasize the belief that citizens engaging in logical discussions and decision-making can effectively govern themselves.
moreover, the constitution upholds a clear separation between church and state, underscoring the importance of a government built on reason.
while our country grapples with significant challenges such as ending wars, job creation, education, budget management, and social welfare, the key to resolving these issues lies in the application of reason rather than resorting solely to prayer.
in chicago, usa, an 18-year-old man named adel daoud was apprehended under suspicion of orchestrating a bomb attack.
the fbi revealed that daoud's plan involved detonating a car bomb outside a city bar.
the fbi had been monitoring daoud's activities, detecting his online discussions about violent jihad and harming americans.
daoud was taken into custody during a sting operation on friday, in which undercover agents, pretending to be extremists, provided him with a fake bomb.
authorities clarified that the bomb was non-functional, ensuring no threat to the public.
daoud faces charges of attempting to utilize a weapon of mass destruction and plotting to damage a building with explosives, which could lead to a life imprisonment sentence.
to preempt potential terror threats, us law enforcement has increasingly utilized sting operations.
while there have been convictions resulting from these operations, some muslim and civil rights organizations have raised concerns regarding the deployment of such tactics.
on thursday evening, we finally got to try the long-awaited baconnaise for the first time.
anticipation had been building during the weeks of waiting for our back-ordered delivery, and i was unsure of how best to approach the taste test.
we opted for a twist on the classic blt, doubling down on the bacon experience.
our creation included lightly toasted multi-grain bread, ripe vine tomatoes, mixed greens, crispy bacon, and a generous spread of baconnaise, which i made sure to distribute right to the edges for a full flavor evaluation.
as we delved into tasting, i found myself wavering between preferring bbq sauce and being tempted to eat it with a spoon.
denine appreciated the bacon essence and noted that it had a pleasant, not overly smoky profile.
we mutually agreed that incorporating actual bacon pieces into the product would be a wonderful addition.
further tasting sessions are definitely in order.
as we share deliveries with others eagerly awaiting their baconnaise, we have already placed a second order.
our inaugural jar now resides safely on the top shelf of the refrigerator, marking the onset of baconnaise craze in our city.

the department cited existing use of security cameras in compton city parks and at the gateway town center as one reason for not disclosing the aerial surveillance program.
however, this rationale falls short considering the extensive scope of the program.
while there may have been potential agreement among citizens and officials on the benefits of enhanced security, the decision to deploy a camera-equipped cessna to capture imagery of residents' backyard activities raises concerns.
it appears that the sheriff's department was aware of the potential backlash, as evidenced by the revelation from a department official involved in the project to the center for investigative reporting that confidentiality was maintained to preempt objections.
the official acknowledged concerns about privacy and surveillance, referring to the program as "the eye in the sky, the big brother." social fixer offers an array of features designed to enhance your facebook usage.

katrina lantos swett, the daughter of former hungarian-born us congressman tom lantos, has made the decision to return a prestigious award to hungary as a form of protest against the country's choice to honor zsolt bayer, a writer accused of anti-semitism.
the award, the knight's cross of the order of merit, was given to lantos swett for her efforts in advocating for minorities, which she feels has been undermined by the decision to also award bayer.
she strongly criticized bayer for his offensive writings and believes he should face condemnation rather than accolades for his reprehensible content.
lantos swett is among approximately 100 individuals who have returned hungarian state awards in objection to bayer's recognition.
her hope is that her actions will prompt the hungarian government to reconsider its association with bayer, who has been known for making derogatory remarks about the roma community and muslims, as well as penning articles deemed as anti-semitic.
despite having been praised for her founding of the tom lantos institute in budapest, an organization dedicated to defending minority rights, lantos swett felt compelled to take a stand against the decision to honor bayer.
the us holocaust memorial museum has also called on hungary's prime minister viktor orban and president janos ader to retract the award granted to bayer.
as a member of orban's fidesz party, bayer had been given the award for his journalistic work, which included coverage on hungarian minorities in transylvania and the plight of hungarian prisoners in the soviet union.
although bayer expressed regret for some of his past contentious language, critics have continued to denounce his writings as racist and anti-semitic.
the united nations syria envoy, staffan de mistura, held a meeting on wednesday in moscow with russian defense minister sergei shoigu ahead of a forthcoming round of discussions aimed at resolving syria's six-year conflict.
during the meeting, the officials deliberated on transitioning from de-escalation zones to establish a more enduring political settlement in syria, as reported by de mistura in a statement from the defense ministry.
russia, a significant supporter of syrian president bashar al-assad, has played a crucial role in both the conflict and in diplomatic endeavors to institute and oversee four secure zones throughout the war-torn nation.
these zones were agreed upon during negotiations in astana with iran and turkey, who support conflicting sides in the dispute, to be established in the idlib province in the north, in homs in central syria, in east ghouta in the damascus suburbs, and in the south of syria.
while violence in these zones has significantly decreased since their inception this year, conflict remains rampant in other parts of syria, including a military campaign led by the us against jihadist groups in the northeastern region.
de mistura expressed his intentions to organize a new round of talks in geneva in the upcoming weeks, following previous negotiation sessions where the fate of assad stood as a pivotal unresolved issue.
premier gladys berejiklian has highlighted the franchising of sydney's ferry system as proof that her government is not favoring blue-ribbon liberal areas when it comes to privatizing services.
a recent controversy arose following transport minister andrew constance's unexpected announcement to privatize bus operations in sydney's inner west, aligning them with the model already in place in most of western sydney.
during a visit to the sydney institute of marine science, ms.
constance confirmed that a new "b-line" bus service serving the lower north shore and northern beaches would remain under government operation through state transit.
when asked about potentially expanding privatization to buses in the eastern suburbs and north shore, the premier refused to make definitive statements, stating, "i prefer not to make commitments at this time." a recent global study revealed that activities as simple as vacuuming and scrubbing the floor provide substantial health benefits, including protecting the heart and increasing longevity.
researchers discovered that engaging in just 30 minutes of physical activity daily, or a total of 150 minutes per week, could decrease the risk of death from any cause by 28 percent and lower the likelihood of heart disease by one fifth.
interestingly, the scientists noted in the lancet journal that vigorous exercise like running or swimming was not required to achieve these health benefits.
surprisingly, out of over 130,000 participants from 17 countries in the study, less than 3 percent who reached high activity levels did so through recreational activities.
in contrast, nearly 40 percent of individuals who were highly active obtained their exercise from activities such as commuting, physically demanding jobs, or household chores.
two months following the discovery of the heartbleed bug, it is noted that about 300,000 servers are still at risk of being exploited.
the bug, unearthed by a google engineer, sparked widespread concern and prompted companies globally to hurriedly patch their servers.
this vulnerability, affecting openssl, an open-source software utilized for securing information on the internet, has the potential to expose log-in credentials and passwords if manipulated.
the critical aspect of this bug lies in its integration within the widely-used openssl framework, leading to a significant number of servers being vulnerable online.
upon the bug's exposure, security expert robert david graham from errata security determined that around 600,000 servers were susceptible.
as time progressed, half of these servers were fortified against the heartbleed bug, leaving 318,239 still defenseless.
however, after two months, the number of exposed servers has decreased to 309,197, with the rate of patching declining drastically.
graham explains that the reluctance to patch systems suggests a likelihood of continued vulnerabilities in the future, especially among smaller enterprises that have yet to take action.
despite efforts by major online companies to safeguard their servers, graham anticipates thousands of systems will remain at risk, including vital ones, even ten years from now.
to safeguard account details, individuals are advised to utilize mcafee's free checker to identify vulnerable websites and employ distinct passwords for each online account.
this information was originally published on zdnet under the title "heartbleed: over 300,000 servers still exposed." during a successful climb in the standings and a resurgence of playoff chances, the toronto blue jays are said to be maintaining a forward-looking perspective towards the next season.
reports suggest that the blue jays have reached out to former detroit tigers general manager dave dombrowski, as indicated by bob elliott of the toronto sun, in connection to the team's upcoming vacancy for the role of president.
following an illustrious career spanning almost four decades within the organization, paul beeston is preparing to step down from his position as the blue jays' president at the season's end.
various notable figures, such as baltimore orioles' dan duquette and chicago white sox's kenny williams, have also been rumored to express interest in this prestigious position.
dombrowski, aged 59, recently parted ways with detroit after nearly 14 seasons as part of his desire to explore fresh career opportunities, as communicated by tigers owner mike ilitch.
league sources report that wolves president of operations, flip saunders, has engaged in discussions with the celtics regarding garnett.
however, it remains unspecified who initiated these talks, which players the celtics may be eyeing on the wolves' roster, and whether garnett would be willing to waive his no-trade clause to return to minnesota.
one source characterized these discussions as part of saunders' precautionary measures in case a contract agreement cannot be reached with restricted free agent center, pekovic.
it is worth noting that the potential acquisition of garnett does not rule out the possibility of him coexisting with pekovic on the team.
nevertheless, the source emphasized that garnett is primarily being viewed as a fallback option.
existing economics research suggests that compensating agents based on their performance can prompt them to increase their efforts, ultimately boosting productivity.
conversely, psychology studies argue that performance-driven financial rewards may stifle creativity and innovation.
through a controlled laboratory experiment, our research demonstrates that a combination of embracing early failures alongside rewarding long-term success can effectively incentivize innovation.
participants under this incentive structure exhibit greater exploration and are more inclined to unearth innovative business strategies compared to those operating under flat-wage or traditional pay-for-performance incentives.
additionally, our findings reveal that the fear of job loss can hinder innovation incentives, whereas the presence of golden parachutes can counteract such negative effects on innovation.
in conclusion, well-crafted incentives play a crucial role in fostering creativity and innovation.
a british man, mounir rarmoul-bouhadjar, has confessed to possessing a bomb-making document stored on a memory card.
he made this admission during a court hearing at the old bailey on tuesday.
the news can now be disclosed as reporting restrictions have been removed.
rarmoul-bouhadjar, aged 26, was acquitted of another charge involving an improperly acquired passport and will receive his sentencing on a later date.
he was apprehended alongside erol incedal, who faces terrorism-related charges and is scheduled for trial next week.
incedal, also 26, has pleaded not guilty to charges of possessing a terrorist document and engaging in activities preparing for terrorist acts.
initially identified as cd and ab respectively, both defendants can now be named following the lifting of reporting restrictions.
a portion of the trial will be conducted in private per a ruling by the court of appeal.
previous efforts to conduct the trial entirely behind closed doors were challenged by media organizations, leading to a change in the approach mandated by mr.
the revised ruling dictates that while certain confidential sections may be held in private, significant parts of the trial must be conducted publicly, as held by the appeal judges.
prosecutors justified their push for a closed trial on grounds of national security.
danang, vietnam - following a legal challenge against a controversial quebec law prohibiting individuals from wearing face coverings while giving or receiving public services, prime minister justin trudeau has stated that the federal government is actively exploring ways to potentially intervene.
trudeau's comments on quebec's bill 62 represent a significant indicator of the federal government's stance on the legislation, which has faced criticism nationwide for its perceived discrimination against muslim women.
recent claims filed in the province argue that the bill is unconstitutional and discriminates against an already marginalized community.
despite this, the quebec government has maintained that the law aligns with the charter of rights and freedoms and prioritizes safety for all.
speaking in vietnam, trudeau addressed the bill for the first time since the legal challenge emerged, expressing considerations on how the government might respond to the legislation.
according to sources at sky sports, newcastle united has submitted an improved offer to acquire mathieu debuchy, the france international right-back from lille.
despite lille rejecting an earlier bid from the magpies this season, debuchy has been a longstanding target for the club.
initially hesitant to part with debuchy before securing a replacement, lille's recent signing of djibril sidibe from troyes seems to have expedited the process.
newcastle is now making efforts to finalize the deal quickly by increasing their offer.
debuchy, who is eager to join st james' park, has received encouragement from his friend and former lille teammate yohan cabaye, who expressed optimism about the potential transfer.
while inter milan has also shown interest, newcastle is considered the frontrunner to secure the 27-year-old defender's signature, as he still has three years remaining on his contract.

the relatives of fugitive serbian war crimes suspect ratko mladic have disclosed that they have lost contact with him for around seven years.
consequently, the family has initiated a request for him to be declared legally deceased.
the motion was officially filed by the mladic family's attorney, milos saljic, to belgrade's first municipal court.
saljic stated that the family's decision stemmed from their lack of communication with mladic and his reportedly declining health condition.
ratko mladic was indicted 15 years ago for his involvement in the srebrenica massacre, where 8,000 muslim men were killed, and the 43-month siege of sarajevo.
the apprehension of mladic has been a pivotal precondition set forth by the european union for the advancement of serbia's membership status.
according to chinese media reports, cracks recently developed on a u-shaped glass-bottomed skywalk encircling a mountain cliff in china, leading to tourists hurriedly leaving the structure.
the skywalk is located on yuntai mountain in henan province and is situated over 1,000 meters above sea level.
photos shared by internet users depicted visible cracks on the reinforced glass flooring.

earlier this week, our coverage focused on the endeavors of an indiana state legislator who was advocating for the inclusion of creationism in the state's science classrooms.
subsequently, he succeeded in shepherding a revised bill through the state's senate, which, while less overtly sectarian, still undeniably endorsed religious perspectives.
however, the indiana house leader expressed reservations yesterday about the state entering a realm that the supreme court has deemed an unconstitutional endorsement of religion.
numerous analogous bills are introduced in state legislatures annually, and as experienced through interactions with the media, the sponsors often exhibit significant misunderstandings of both scientific concepts and legal implications.
frequently, these sponsors misinterpret terms like "theory," erroneously assert the existence of competing scientific rationales for the diversity of life, or inaccurately equate evolution with theories pertaining to life's origins.
dennis kruse, the sponsor of the indiana bill, demonstrated misconceptions on all of these fronts.
while sponsors of such bills typically display ignorance of legal precedents, including supreme court rulings that have deemed the teaching of creationism unconstitutional, kruse deviates from this pattern by acknowledging these precedents.
notably, he is banking on his bill sparking a legal challenge that could lead to a revision of established precedents by the supreme court.
however, the house speaker has since indicated a reluctance to challenge supreme court decisions, implying that he may not present the bill for a vote.
the analysis by scienceinsider suggested that widespread media attention on the bill rendered it politically unpalatable, underscoring the influential role that ongoing coverage of similar bills can play in advancing accurate science education.
today's coverage of uganda's presidential and parliamentary elections concludes here.
the significant delays in commencing voting in some areas received strong criticism from the commonwealth observer mission leader, former nigerian president olusegun obasanjo, who deemed it "absolutely inexcusable".
additionally, the decision to block access to certain social media platforms during the voting process sparked widespread disapproval.
president yoweri museveni defended this action, citing security concerns.
the day also saw opposition candidate kizza besigye being briefly detained for the second time in a week.
despite these challenges, enthusiasm among ugandans for the electoral process was evident as many proudly shared photos of their inked thumbs on social media.
the election results are expected to be announced by saturday.
as we conclude, here is a snapshot of residents in kampala patiently waiting in line at a polling station at dusk.
earlier today, jovani "fabbbyyy" guillen revealed his intention to seek a new team and is currently entertaining offers from the north american league championship series or north american challenger series.
it seems that the upcoming north american regional finals will mark the potential conclusion of fabbbyyy's collaboration with team liquid, as phil "jynthe" vu is slated to take the starting position for team liquid in the matchup against team envy this saturday.
fabbbyyy stepped in for the longstanding starting ad, chae "piglet" gwang-jin, mid-season, delivering a mixed performance during his rookie split with the club.
while he excelled in the previous gaming meta, the self-proclaimed "gatekeeper of challenger" struggled during the playoffs against counter logic gaming and was even substituted out in some games, paving the way for jynthe, a newcomer to the professional scene.
despite team liquid's 3-1 loss in the series, jynthe surpassed fabbbyyy in their confrontations, notably shining in team liquid's victory in the third set.
the french media is referring to the unscathed survival of an 18-month-old toddler as a "miracle" after the child fell from a sixth-floor apartment while unattended by his parents.
miraculously, the boy bounced off a cafe awning below the apartment where a passing doctor spotted him falling, managed to catch him before he hit the ground.
witnesses shared that the doctor found no injuries on the child, who was then taken to the hospital for a check-up.
initially mistaken for a girl in reports picked up by the bbc, the baby was later confirmed to be a boy.
this heart-stopping incident occurred at the intersection of cours de vincennes and rue des pyrenees in the 20th arrondissement on a late monday afternoon.
a resident from a building opposite the apartment recounted seeing the toddler playing near the window with an older girl and had a premonition that something might go wrong.
the man who caught the falling child was passing by with his family when they noticed the baby's fall.
witnesses like francois detailed how the doctor expertly positioned himself near the awning, catching the child as he bounced off it.
the child, initially tearful, quickly calmed down in the doctor's arms.
identified as philippe benseniot, the doctor humbly attributed the successful catch to pure luck, mentioning that he happened to be in the right place at the right time.
an update on 4 november 2010 corrected the earlier misconception about the child's gender from girl to boy.
a man in germany, reportedly driven by anger over a family dispute, detonated explosives outside his residence in the village of homberg, resulting in his own death and injuring seven individuals.
according to police spokesperson thomas rodemer, the 49-year-old man, following a domestic altercation at his home in hesse state, left in his car and then returned to detonate explosives inside the parked vehicle, causing harm to family members, neighbors, and two responding police officers.

established in 1713 by mary chapman, the bethel hospital stands as the nation's inaugural purpose-built asylum.
despite its original intention of providing humane treatments, historical records reveal the use of restraints such as straight jackets, handcuffs, and padlocks.

starting in the 1970s, sections of the facility began to shutter, culminating in the complete closure of the site by 1995, intended for redevelopments.
although most of the redevelopment plans were executed, a small portion was left untouched, embodying the remnants of the hospital's history.

baloch, who appeared in the north shore district court facing accusations of misusing a telephone, breaching bail, and driving under the influence, asserted that his inebriated calls were always filled with positivity and compliments.
the court hearing was postponed as baloch's lawyer encountered difficulties playing the recorded calls made by baloch to the authorities.

despite the circumstances, baloch claimed that the police station staff were familiar with him due to his previous calls and treated him well.
growing up in pakistan within a military family, he professed a genuine respect for law enforcement and hoped that the charges would be lessened as he maintained a cheerful and positive demeanor without any threats towards the police.

in bogota, colombia, numerous farmers gathered to march demanding the government to fulfill agreements made in september.
the farmers claimed that 72 out of 88 points agreed upon during the prior protest had been violated, as expressed by leader cesar pachon.
previously, these farmers had criticized the government's agricultural policies, alleging that free trade agreements with the european union and the united states had led to a market inundated with competitively priced agricultural goods, exacerbating their economic woes.
the farmers also cited escalating fuel and production costs that had rendered small-scale farming unprofitable.
the protests ceased after the government took steps, such as offering better prices for agricultural products and increased access to loans, to alleviate the farmers' plight and safeguard them against competition from cheaper imported goods.
however, pachon, representing the dignidades de colombia movement, disclosed that farmers were still selling goods below cost, facing heavy debts, and contending with continued market saturation by imports.
while agriculture minister ruben dario lizarralde maintained that the government was striving to meet the farmers' demands, insisting on the efforts made in engaging with small-scale farmers, concerns persist among farmers regarding their financial viability.

russian police in moscow apprehended fifteen radical islamists who were found in possession of bombs, hand grenades, and firearms, as reported by authorities.
the individuals were allegedly affiliated with the islamist organization at-takfir wal-hijra and were taken into custody during early-morning raids in the eastern part of the city.
along with the arrests, law enforcement discovered three makeshift explosives, along with materials for creating additional devices.
at-takfir wal-hijra was prohibited by russia's supreme court in 2010 for promoting discord between different ethnic and religious groups.
the group has been recognized in local media for its substantial extremist activities in the area and shares a name with a militant group established in egypt during the 1960s, though any connection between the two remains unclear.
with the approaching winter olympics in sochi, these arrests are anticipated to garner heightened global attention, particularly due to the ongoing conflict between russian authorities and separatists in regions like chechnya, leading to a rise in islamist attacks across the north caucasus.
while moscow has experienced a decrease in militant incidents since the conclusion of the second chechen war, the severity of attacks such as the 2011 suicide bombing at domodedovo international airport, which claimed 37 lives, underscores the persistent threat posed by extremist elements.

nevertheless, some canadians suggest that the notion of a maple scent could be an accidental outcome of the manufacturing process, indicating that the myth is likely to endure.

hosted by bollywood icon salman khan, the program has garnered a massive following in india since its eighth season launch in october.
during a hearing by the national assembly's defense committee on monday, south korean defense minister kim kwan-jin confirmed the successful test launch of a kn-06 surface-to-air missile by north korea into the west sea earlier this month.
kim stated that north korea was likely evaluating its latest weapon system, noting the successful outcome of the test.
the kn-06 missile was first unveiled at a military parade marking the 65th anniversary of the founding of north korea's workers party on october 10 the previous year.
designated as a kn-06 in south korea's 2010 defense white paper, the missile is designed for air defense operations, distinguishing itself from previous north korean missiles like the arch-like trajectory-following kn-02 inter-continental ballistic missile.
housed in a launching tube, the kn-06 is launched vertically to intercept flying targets, resembling the russian s-300 system for missile interception.
it appears that north korea derived its technology for the kn-06 from sources including china, russia, and other undisclosed origins.
with a range capability of up to 150 km, surpassing the s-300 range of 75-90 km, each launcher truck for the kn-06 can accommodate two to three missiles.
north korea developed this advanced weapon system due to challenges in procuring new fighter jets from international partners, while south korea has upgraded its fleet with state-of-the-art f-15k fighter jets.
by next year, seoul's air force is set to possess 60 f-15ks capable of executing precise strikes against north korean nuclear facilities and missile installations.
stellenbosch university in cape town has recently implemented an updated admissions policy for 2018 in an effort to address historical inequalities.
the university stated that it acknowledges the importance of reserving spots for students who come from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds, irrespective of their racial classification.
these students are those who have met the minimum entry requirements for a particular course but may not have secured admission based on other factors.
the university specified that for the 2018 academic year, three key considerations would guide the admissions process: academic achievement in school, reshaping the racial diversity of the student population, and addressing socio-economic disparities experienced by some students.
this policy, which was approved by the university's council following extensive consultations spanning over two and a half years and a thorough task team investigation, aims to promote a society that is non-racial and egalitarian, ultimately eliminating the need for race-based affirmative action in the future.
"stellenbosch is a university that welcomes all south africans," remarked su rector prof wim de villiers.
the institution, like many others, faced student-led demonstrations regarding tuition fees and educational accessibility in the past year.
furthermore, stellenbosch university introduced a new language policy last june to accommodate students who prefer studying in afrikaans while also enhancing educational opportunities for those proficient in english only.

far uv light, not to be confused with the type used in tanning salons, is specifically designed to target and eliminate microbes.
in a bathroom equipped with this technology, the lights are activated only when sensors detect that there are no occupants.
the moment the door is closed, the lights pulsate to sanitize any germs present, with even the toilet cover lifting automatically to ensure a thorough clean.
this entire process is completed in just three seconds.
for those especially concerned with cleanliness, nearly every feature inside the bathroom operates hands-free.
sensors enable functions like lifting the toilet cover and seat by simply waiving a hand over them.
the faucet, soap dispenser, hand dryer, and trash can cover all incorporate their own sensors for touchless use.
while the current design still requires manually operating the door latch, plans are in place to make this hands-free as well.
additionally, a proposed vacuum vent system aims to address spills on the bathroom floor.
the introduction of a self-cleaning toilet has implications for reducing maintenance costs for airlines and could also appeal to germaphobes hesitant to travel.
interestingly, despite the focus on bathroom cleanliness, a 2015 study revealed that the tray table, rather than any surface in the bathroom, harbors the most germs on an airplane.
valencia winner fernando alonso and mclaren's lewis hamilton narrowly escaped penalties during the recent european grand prix.
according to germany's auto motor und sport, a team bosses meeting was held at silverstone where fia officials informed them that alonso and hamilton had technically violated the rules at valencia.
they would have faced sanctions had rival teams filed official protests.
hamilton was reported to have overtaken pole sitter sebastian vettel twice during the pre-race warm-up lap, which is a prohibited practice.
alonso was also found to have breached regulations by accepting the spanish flag from a marshal on the slowing-down lap after his exhilarating victory.
furthermore, the blick newspaper has dubbed hamilton the unofficial "bad guy" of formula one, as per a document circulating in the silverstone paddock listing all f1 offenses over the past decade, with the 27-year-old british driver leading the pack.
according to state media reports, two individuals, said to be from the uighur minority group, have died after allegedly attempting to hijack a plane in china's volatile xinjiang region.
the global times stated that the men succumbed to injuries sustained while trying to force entry into the cockpit of the aircraft.
following the incident on friday, during which multiple individuals were harmed, six suspects were taken into custody.
tensions between chinese authorities and the uighur community are common, with the uighurs often voicing concerns about oppression and discrimination.
the global times, referencing unidentified officials, suggested that the deceased individuals had perished "due to injuries sustained during a confrontation with passengers and crew." additionally, two other suspects were hospitalized after reportedly inflicting self-harm.
the tianjin airlines flight, en route from hotan to urumqi, was disrupted by the men's attempted breach of the cockpit using a damaged aluminum crutch as a weapon before being subdued by passengers and crew.
despite chinese accounts indicating an attempted hijacking, dilxat raxit, a spokesperson for the world uighur congress, doubted this narrative, suggesting it stemmed from a dispute over seating rather than a hijack attempt.
approximately half of xinjiang's population consists of uighurs, a muslim minority group with ties to central asia.
allegations of discrimination by uighurs have fueled anti-han chinese sentiments and separatist movements in the region since the 1990s, culminating in violent incidents like the 2009 riots that claimed nearly 200 lives amid tensions between uighur and han chinese communities, prompting sporadic incidents of conflict and violence in the following years.
un secretary general ban ki-moon expressed his desire to visit north korea soon, although no definite decision has been reached yet.
this marks the first acknowledgment of ongoing discussions regarding the potential visit.
the un recently refuted reports suggesting a confirmed visit, inclusive of a meeting with leader kim jong-un, set for this week.
both koreas are slated for uncommon talks on thursday with the intention of bettering relations.
this gathering would be the first meeting since august, a period marked by heightened tensions culminating in a brief skirmish at the heavily fortified border.
north korea criticized south korea for conducting a live-fire drill near their disputed sea boundary on tuesday, warning of a possible response to the perceived provocation.
ban, a former south korean foreign minister, has repeatedly offered his willingness to contribute constructively towards peace, stability, and dialogue on the korean peninsula.
an earlier planned trip by him to north korea in may was abruptly called off.
however, reports last week indicating a scheduled visit were denied by the united nations.
ban disclosed on monday that there were encouraging signals regarding a prospective visit.
he mentioned ongoing discussions to plan a trip "at the earliest time." if the visit materializes, mr.
ban would only be the third un secretary general to visit north korea, which is under un sanctions due to its nuclear weapons program.
the korean war never formally ended, leaving the two koreas technically at war since the ceasefire in 1953.
the lawn tennis association has unveiled a plan to distribute 10,000 complimentary tennis racquets and provide 10,000 free junior tennis courses to identify budding talent for the future.
in addition, the lta intends to embark on a nationwide tour to 50 different venues with the prestigious davis cup trophy as part of their initiatives.
this initiative comes in response to critiques from tennis star andy murray, emphasizing the need for the lta to nurture top-tier talent.
following their davis cup victory in november by triumphing over belgium, british captain leon smith expressed the intention to seize the moment and engage as many children as possible in the sport.
the program will be led by a team of 1,000 dedicated and skilled coaches, ensuring quality instruction according to an official lta announcement.
the launch of this offering will precede the davis cup's first-round match against japan in march, opening up opportunities for children and families to participate.
in the largest us prison in afghanistan, located at bagram, prisoners have been staging a protest for the past two weeks by refusing to leave their cells for basic activities such as showering or exercising.
the inmates are demonstrating against their indefinite detention.
this protest began around july 1 and sheds light on a facility known for its secretive operations, even more so than guantanamo bay.
the international committee of the red cross discovered the protest after informing families of prisoners about the cancellation of scheduled video calls and visits.
the red cross personnel, who monitor prisoners' treatment and communication, were unable to meet with the inmates during their last visit on july 5.
the prisoners, totaling 620, are not resorting to hunger strikes or violence, according to ramzi kassem, an attorney representing a yemeni detainee at bagram.
kassem expressed that the detainees are protesting the lack of legal recourse and the absence of trials for their imprisonment.
unlike guantanamo bay, where prisoners have access to legal representation, those at bagram are deprived of this privilege, as neither visits from afghan government representatives nor lawyers are permitted.
the us military has not provided any public comments on the situation.
tottenham hotspur has released seven players, with gomes, giancarlo gallifuoco, cameron lancaster, roman michael-percil, jonathan miles, kevin stewart, and lawrence vigouroux departing the club.
the departure of gomes, the only senior player leaving, was confirmed recently.
gallifuoco and lancaster, who were once seen as potential premier league talents, are now expected to seek opportunities in lower league football to climb back up the english football hierarchy.
on a positive note, young prospects dominic ball, grant hall, jon obika, and nathan oduwa have had their contracts extended, indicating the club's belief in their premier league potential or market value.
notably, the club has extended contract offers to brad friedel and souleymane coulibaly, with uncertainty over their future at the club, but efforts being made to retain them.

parks victoria staff in warrandyte have allowed toxic chemical waste to enter the yarra river, resulting in the death of trees and posing a significant "public health risk" near a popular swimming area in melbourne.
an internal report on parks victoria's operations highlights that a harmful combination of chemicals and herbicides has been discharged into the yarra from a facility near pound bend, a well-known spot for recreational activities such as swimming, fishing, and canoeing within warrandyte state park.
the report identifies a concrete wash-down facility utilized for cleaning vehicles, rinsing chemical containers, and preparing herbicides for park maintenance as the source of the contamination.
this hazardous waste disposal has already caused tree fatalities on-site and has subsequently contaminated the river.
reports have emerged stating that a prestigious university in china has decided to terminate the contract of xia yeliang, a well-known economist and advocate for free speech.
xia, the economics faculty at peking university voted to expel him.
he has been an outspoken supporter of democratic principles.
this dismissal coincides with a broader trend in china, where authorities are intensifying their grip on the media and online platforms, detaining bloggers and activists.
xia played a role in drafting charter 08, a document advocating for political reforms in china, and is a close associate of liu xiaobo, the recipient of the nobel peace prize in 2010, who is currently incarcerated.
bbc world service conducted an interview with mr.
xia during the time of mr.
liu's recognition, where he disclosed that he had been warned by the authorities against speaking to the media or commemorating his friend's accolade.

xia spent the academic year 2012-13 as a visiting scholar at stanford university in california.
president donald trump declared on thursday that the united states would be pulling out of the historic paris climate agreement.
he also mentioned plans to engage in discussions to rejoin the accord under what he described as a more equitable agreement, a move that was promptly criticized by various european governments.
this decision sets the largest economy in the world apart from most other nations globally and counters the stance of many prominent american corporations.
trump, known for his flair, revealed the choice during a highly publicized event in the rose garden of the white house, receiving applause from administration officials and conservatives present.
"in order to uphold my solemn obligation to safeguard america and its people, the united states will exit the paris climate accord, but will initiate talks to potentially rejoin either the existing agreement or negotiate an entirely new deal that is beneficial to the united states, its businesses, its workforce, its citizens, and its taxpayers," trump stated.
pope francis has approved the canonization of five new child saints.
among them are two portuguese shepherd children who claimed an apparition of the virgin mary in fatima a century ago and three mexican teenagers martyred for their faith in the 16th century.
the canonization decrees were signed by francis on thursday.
notably, in the case of the mexican children, known as the child martyrs of tlaxcala, francis deemed them worthy of sainthood without requiring a miracle attributed to their intercession, a departure from the usual process.
the young boys, cristobal, antonio, and juan, were converted to catholicism by missionaries in the early 1500s.
conversely, for the fatima siblings, francisco and jacinta marto, a miracle was authenticated prior to their canonization, which aligns with the traditional procedure.
in a timely gesture, just months before his visit to the fatima shrine to commemorate the centenary of their apparitions, francis followed protocol by approving a miracle for the portuguese siblings.
an afghan woman aged 30 was brutally beheaded by a faction of taliban extremists for allegedly committing an act of "infidelity" by going shopping unaccompanied by her husband.
this appalling incident occurred in the remote village of latti within afghanistan's sar-e-pul province, an area under taliban control, as reported by the independent.
the victim was fatally stabbed and beheaded by a group of armed assailants while her husband was away in iran.
despite these accusations, the taliban has refuted any involvement in the ghastly crime.
the taliban, known as a strict sunni muslim movement in afghanistan, imposes harsh regulations on women, curtailing their rights and freedoms.
women are subjected to severe restrictions such as being prohibited from speaking loudly, leaving home unaccompanied by a male relative, limited educational opportunities, and restricted employment prospects.
disobeying these rules often leads to brutal punishments like lashings and even executions.
notably, captain niloofar rahmani, afghanistan's pioneering female pilot, and the first woman to undergo training as an afghan air force pilot, has sought asylum in the united states due to escalating safety concerns after receiving threats from militant groups.
despite completing a 15-month training course in the us, rahmani decided against returning to afghanistan over fears for her family's safety.
however, her asylum request has sparked backlash in afghanistan, with criticism aimed at her for allegedly betraying her homeland by seeking refuge in the us.
general mohammad radmanish, a defense ministry spokesperson, cast doubt on rahmani's claims, insinuating that she fabricated the threats to bolster her asylum plea.
canterbury legend and director steve mortimer is concerned about the bulldogs potentially deviating from their traditional values under des hasler, as they face a crucial meeting that may decide the coach's fate at the club.
a number of bulldogs directors share these apprehensions about the direction of the "family club" under hasler, which will be deliberated in an emergency meeting scheduled for friday.
while hasler is contracted until the following year, talks of a two-year extension have hit a standstill after over six months of negotiations.
if hasler were to depart from the club, former bulldogs player and current raiders assistant coach dean pay is reportedly the front-runner to succeed him.
mortimer, a respected figure within the club, serves as a director for both the leagues and football clubs.
although mortimer acknowledges hasler's coaching abilities, he raises doubts about whether the former manly coach is a suitable match for belmore.
austin harig, the 18-year-old who ran against carl paladino in the 2016 buffalo school board election, has once again found himself in legal trouble.
early thursday morning, police were called to his residence on zittel street in south buffalo following reports of threats and harassment.
upon arrival, officers discovered a young man on the porch stairs with injuries to his head and body as a result of an altercation.
additionally, another young man was injured while attempting to intervene in the situation, as reported by a police source to 7 eyewitness news.
harig, along with jonathan tyner, 21, were both arrested at the scene.
harig faces charges of third-degree assault with intent to cause physical harm, first-degree gang assault causing serious physical injury, and second-degree harassment.
tyner, on the other hand, is charged with obstruction of governmental administration and resisting arrest.
this latest incident marks the second time this year that harig has faced legal charges, with a previous accusation in june involving providing alcohol to underage individuals.
journeying to the videogame history museum has proven challenging thus far as the majority of its collection remains in storage, with only a small portion currently on cross-country tours.
however, there is hope on the horizon as plans are underway for a permanent public display.
the frisco, texas community board recently greenlit a deal to allocate a 10,400 square foot space for the museum within the city's discovery center by this april.
though this space is not expansive - slightly bigger than a baseball diamond - it will allow visitors to easily reconnect with the consoles that shaped their childhood.
this location is just the initial step as the founders are optimistic about securing funds from corporate sponsors post-launch to establish a larger operational base.
while frisco may not be the most accessible destination for those outside of the dallas area, it certainly offers a more convenient option compared to waiting for the mobile exhibit to come to your town.
according to police spokesman micky rosenfeld, soldiers who were stationed in jerusalem to support the police requested the man to present his id late wednesday.
the man declined, got into a scuffle with the soldiers, and then tried to grab one of their weapons.
subsequently, one soldier shot the man, resulting in his eventual death from the injuries, as reported by rosenfeld.
rosenfeld emphasized that the soldiers held strong suspicions that the man might be a terrorist.
the recent series of palestinian attacks have left israelis feeling apprehensive.
in a separate incident, when an arab citizen of israel unleashed gunfire at a bus station in southern israel last sunday, causing the death of an israeli soldier and injuries to several others, a private security guard mistakenly shot an eritrean migrant whom he believed to be the assailant.
following the shooting, a crowd of people proceeded to attack and inflict harm on the wounded eritrean, who later succumbed to his injuries.
police confirmed through an autopsy that the eritrean died due to gunshot wounds and announced that four individuals would face charges in court regarding the assault.
in response to these events, there has been a surge in the purchase of pepper spray by israelis for self-defense, and certain government officials have advocated for citizens to carry firearms for personal protection.
during an interview with ronahi tv, bab council member mihemed abdulrezak condemned the recent aggressive actions of the turkish army in rojava.
he reported that turkish fighter jets had carried out airstrikes on the liberated villages of um hosh, um qura, and al-hassia, which were previously freed from isis control in a recent operation.
abdulrezak emphasized that the airstrikes were a deliberate attempt to impede the progress of revolutionary forces against isis militants.
the attacks, which targeted civilian populations, resulted in the tragic deaths of four civilians and left dozens more wounded.
additionally, the aerial offensive also struck positions belonging to the army of revolutionaries, resulting in the loss of 10 fighters and several others injured.
despite facing aggression from the turkish army, affiliated groups, and isis, abdulrezak affirmed their unwavering commitment to continue fighting and advancing until the entire shehba region is rid of terrorist factions.
although the international space station is a hub for serious research, the astronauts onboard also manage to find some time for enjoyment.
a recent collection of stunning photos by 53-year-old canadian commander chris hadfield has been circulating online.
captured from the space station as it orbits earth, hadfield's images offer breathtaking views, including a glimpse of the moon rising over the earth, a clear demarcation between israel and egypt, an aerial shot of pyongyang, north korea, and a captivating morning view of new york city with downtown manhattan's skyscrapers casting shadows on the water.
with the help of his son evan, who often promotes his father's exceptional photos to the media, hadfield has gained significant online popularity, boasting close to 650,000 twitter followers.
a recent video demonstrating zero gravity tears has also attracted widespread attention.
scheduled to remain at the space station until may, hadfield is expected to share more remarkable images as he continues his orbit 230 miles above earth.

saskatchewan's liquor laws have been updated to allow strip shows and wet t-shirt contests in bars as of new year's day, marking a significant shift in the province's regulations.
while the new laws permit these entertainment options, performers are still required to adhere to certain rules, such as maintaining coverage over their nipples and refraining from full frontal nudity.
this change is particularly welcomed by individuals like anna scott, the artistic director of the bottoms up burlesque club, where dancers emphasize burlesque performances over typical exotic dancing seen in bars.
scott mentions that previously, even minor acts like removing a glove or feather boa were considered strip-tease under the old regulations.
despite these adjustments, it remains uncertain whether bars will promptly introduce strip shows or wet t-shirt contests.
in saskatoon, the city council has also taken steps to regulate adult entertainment, confining such shows to nightclubs situated in specified industrial zones.
the zatopek event in melbourne is steeped in tradition, yet the 10,000-metre track race named after it faces possible exclusion from the olympics due to recent sweeping changes approved by the ioc in europe.
as part of efforts to streamline the athletics program and make room for additional sports in the olympic schedule, five key events, notably including the 200-meter sprint, shot put, and others, are now in jeopardy.
among the events perceived to be at highest risk in the potential athletics shake-up are the 10,000 meters, the men's 20-kilometer race walk, the 200 meters, shot put, and triple jump.
brian roe, a respected athletics administrator and senior international technical official, revealed that during a meeting of influential figures in the sport, these five events were identified as the most likely candidates for elimination if changes were to be made.
the image of jamaica's usain bolt crossing the finish line to claim gold in a moment of silence captures the essence of the event.
(credit: getty images) the houston texans will be without their top pick for some time as texans coach bill o'brien announced that jadeveon clowney had knee surgery and will be out for four to six weeks.
according to nfl media insider ian rapoport, clowney tore his meniscus.
the injury occurred during houston's victory over the washington redskins, where clowney left the game in the second quarter and didn't return.
prior to his exit, he managed one tackle for a loss.
clowney, who was the first pick in the 2014 nfl draft, has been plagued by injuries, including a recent sports hernia surgery.
the texans had a mixed sunday with this news clouding their win.
the latest episode of the "around the nfl podcast" discusses the falcons' strong offense, rgiii's challenges, and reviews all the week 1 action.
norway has enacted a new law that criminalizes the purchase of sex, imposing hefty fines or up to six months in prison for norwegian citizens caught paying for prostitutes within the country or abroad.
in cases involving child prostitution, the prison sentence could extend to three years.
the objective behind this legislation is to combat sex tourism and street prostitution by targeting clients rather than sex workers.
deputy justice minister astri aas-hansen highlighted the inherent connection between purchasing sex and supporting human trafficking and forced prostitution, labeling it as unacceptable.
notably, these strict measures in norway surpass those implemented by other nordic countries like sweden and finland.
to gather evidence, norwegian police are now permitted to employ wire-tapping devices.
as a result, there has been a visible decrease in the presence of women working on the streets of central oslo.
additionally, prostitutes will be provided with access to free education and health resources, particularly for those struggling with substance abuse issues.
while the government had initiated a promotional campaign prior to the law taking effect, critics of the legislation argue that it may drive prostitution further underground and complicate regulation efforts.
manchester united's goalkeeper, victor valdes, is set to join belgian club standard liege until the end of the season.
at 34, valdes originally signed an 18-month contract with united a year ago but has had minimal game time under louis van gaal, making only two appearances.
valdes missed out on the pre-season tour due to conflict with the manager, and his training was segregated from the first team afterward.
despite his impressive career highlights with barcelona and the spanish national team, including three champions league titles and world cup and euro triumphs, valdes's move to besiktas fell through in august, and his agent confirmed his intentions to depart in january.
valdes hinted at his imminent departure from manchester united in an instagram post shared on thursday.

allegedly, a woman drove her vehicle into her boyfriend upon discovering he was hiv positive.
according to court documents, on april 29th, law enforcement responded to a park near 13th street and hatcher road following reports of a man being struck by a car.
reports indicated that the victim was engaged in a dispute with his girlfriend, 44-year-old misty lee wilke, at the same park.
later, the victim, riding a bicycle, was on his way back to the park when witnesses noted wilke driving in circles in an attempt to collide with him.
consequently, she hit him with her mustang, resulting in severe head injuries and a broken back.
approximately half an hour later, wilke contacted the police from her residence, stating that she had recently learned about her boyfriend's hiv status and alleged that he mocked her for it.
wilke claimed that, during a confrontation where her boyfriend brandished a knife and cut her arm, she pushed him.
following this, she accelerated her car, unintentionally hitting the victim while maneuvering through the park.
wilke, who exhibited a small cut on her arm, now faces two charges of aggravated assault.
fifteen individuals were killed and over 50 were injured in an assault on the iraqi central bank in baghdad.
the attack commenced with a bomb explosion, followed by a confrontation between gunmen and law enforcement as they attempted to breach the building.
according to police reports, five gunmen detonated explosives on themselves.
uncertainty looms over whether the incident was a bank heist, an act of insurgency, or a combination of both, as stated by the bbc's jim muir in baghdad.
this attack occurred a day before iraq's new parliament was scheduled to convene for its inaugural session.
among the casualties, many were identified as bank staff members, noted security authorities.
recent months have witnessed a series of well-coordinated assaults on jewelry establishments and financial institutions.
insurgent groups, as cited by us and iraqi officials, are believed to be executing these attacks to secure funding for their activities.
television broadcasts depicted billows of black smoke billowing over baghdad from the blast site and emergency vehicles speeding through the city.
a nearby power generator, along with its fuel reserves, caught fire, emitting a dense cloud of smoke.
while violence in iraq has significantly decreased since 2006-07, tensions have persisted since the inconclusive results of the march general election.
analysts suggest that the formation of a government and the selection of a prime minister might necessitate weeks of discussions as various political factions seek to reach an agreement.
during a senate intelligence committee hearing, james comey, the former head of the fbi, disclosed that ex-us attorney general loretta lynch instructed him to term the investigation into hillary clinton's emails a "matter" rather than an investigation.
comey expressed his confusion and unease regarding lynch's directive, citing it as a factor that led him to publicize his conclusions on the case.
the scrutiny over clinton's emails heavily impacted her presidential campaign, and some believe it contributed to her loss.
comey revealed in july that the probe into clinton's use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state would be closed without charges.
in his testimony to the senators, comey voiced his disquiet over lynch's request, recalling, "at one point the attorney general directed me not to call it an investigation but instead to call it a matter, which confused me and concerned me." moreover, there were allegations by donald trump that lynch promised clinton protection in exchange for job security if she became president.

fiat chrysler automobiles and jeep have disclosed that the much-anticipated 2018 jeep wrangler redesign will incorporate an eight-speed automatic transmission known for its significant enhancement in fuel efficiency for off-road driving.
although specific details about the next-generation wrangler remain confidential, a recent filing with the securities and exchange commission hinted at the selection of the automatic transmission.
according to the filing, the eight-speed transmission, previously used in the 2014 ram 1500, jeep grand cherokee, and dodge durango, is slated for inclusion in all rear-wheel-drive vehicles from fiat chrysler automobiles, excluding the heavy-duty ram pickup truck and the srt viper.
manufactured by chrysler under license from zf friedrichshafen, this transmission is projected to deliver a fuel consumption improvement of more than 9 percent compared to the discarded five-speed model.
pittsburgh has parted ways with mike adams.
the steelers decided to release the seasoned offensive tackle on thursday due to a failed physical designation.
adams, who was chosen in the second round in 2012, was sidelined all of last season following a back surgery.
despite his contract tolling through 2016 as he spent the previous year on the physically unable to perform list, the team has opted to move on from the underperforming tackle.
while adams began the 2013 season as the starting left tackle, he was later replaced midseason.
although not to blame for his back injury, adams remains one of pittsburgh's notable draft disappointments in recent years.
his future in the game now appears uncertain.
on a brighter note, the steelers can rely on their first-round pick from 2012, the dependable right guard david decastro, who has been a consistent presence on the field, starting all but one game over the last three seasons and providing stability to the team's offensive line.

this phenomenon stretches along the ecliptic and appears like a glowing ufo beam after sunset, a mesmerizing sight i was fortunate to observe each night as i ventured out into the darkness.
the documentary captures the timeless cycle from sunset to night to sunrise, symbolizing an unbroken flow of perpetual motion that has endured since ancient times, representing the sole enduring constant in our existence.
a passer-by discovered her body beneath a bridge a month after she had gone missing.
although officials suspected her death to be accidental, a post-mortem examination was necessary to confirm the exact cause.
hailing from guinea, she was among the pioneering black african models who rose to global fame on the catwalks of the 1980s.
the mother of three vanished after being dropped off from a party, with her handbag later found near her houseboat residence.
known as katoucha and aged 47, she collaborated with renowned designers like yves saint-laurent and christian lacroix during the peak of her career.
although she retired from modeling in 1994, she continued to advocate against female genital mutilation, a cause she personally understood having undergone the practice at nine years old in guinea, as detailed in her book "in my flesh." she viewed her modeling success as a means of overcoming the trauma she endured, embodying a bold and revered femininity.
the spacex falcon 9 spacecraft is currently undergoing rigorous preparations for an upcoming launch scheduled for next week.
today, a comprehensive rehearsal is set to begin at 2:30pm edt, with the falcon's nine engines anticipated to be fired at their maximum power for a duration of two seconds.
although the launch will take place at cape canaveral in florida, it will be broadcast live on the spacex website, with the rocket expected to lift off around 3pm.
the mission will involve the falcon 9 transporting a dragon supply capsule into low-earth orbit on may 7th, with spacex aiming to establish a connection with the international space station.
the falcon and dragon spacecraft have been crafted as successors to the retired space shuttles, and a successful docking would mark the dragon as the first privately-operated vehicle to arrive at the iss.
despite encountering multiple delays, spacex acknowledges the possibility of facing challenges during the docking process on this initial trip.
today's trial will serve as a lead-up to spacex's first flight since 2010, when a dragon capsule was sent into orbit and safely retrieved.
tallinn: the estonian government has made the decision to clear the vegetation along the border between estonia and russia to enhance border safety infrastructure fully.
this decision was prompted by the alleged kidnapping of an estonian counterintelligence agent near the border.
the state forest management center is set to carry out the clearance work, following an agreement reached by prime minister taavi roivas, interior minister hanno pevkur, and environment minister keit pentus-rosimannus.
the estonian public broadcasting cited the news on monday.
government officials emphasized that enhancing border security to safeguard national security is a top priority.
an allocation of 200,000 euros has been made for bush removal and upgrading border guard equipment this summer, while an additional two million euros will be used for reinforcing the border with night vision cameras, border guard weaponry, and personal protective devices.

shadow attorney-general mark dreyfus expressed concerns on abc tv, stating that there is a possibility of journalists or whistleblowers facing up to 10 years in prison for publicly revealing botched operations.
however, he emphasized that the labor party will monitor the implementation of these provisions closely, noting that only a limited number of special intelligence operations are likely to be affected.
additionally, the new laws will grant australian security intelligence organisation officers increased legal protection if they commit an offense during a "special intelligence operation." residents in three borders villages have revitalized disused phone boxes by transforming them into "community information hubs." the phone boxes in crailing, eckford, and nisbet near jedburgh were no longer needed by bt and were repurposed by the communities.
they were refurbished, painted, and equipped with solar power to ensure they are accessible 24/7.
these hubs now serve as a valuable resource, offering information on local events, history, walking routes, and environmental issues for both residents and tourists.
in an effort to promote sustainability, there is also a sales and swaps notice board to encourage "green" practices, along with a selection of magazines for exchange.
the initiative, led by crailing, eckford, and nisbet community council, received funding from the people's postcode trust.
community councillor, sheila campbell, highlighted that the project not only restored the phone boxes to their former glory but also provided them with a new and practical purpose.

the company is considering expanding support for additional tracking stations and consequently a larger physical area, but they do not have a specific timeline available.
this means that using a warehouse-sized vr space is not currently feasible.
an official mounting option for steamvr is not expected until later in 2018, and the new next-generation tracking system will not be compatible with existing htc vive headsets.
however, developers can utilize the vive with engineering samples that incorporate a blinker for backward compatibility.
while this may not have a significant impact on individual vr users who primarily use vr in their homes, it is more geared towards public or commercial vr applications where minimizing limitations is crucial.
these advancements could be pivotal for vr as a whole, as they aim to enable walkabout vr experiences with restrictions primarily based on room size rather than the number of trackers.
although not truly limitless, this approach offers more creative freedom to developers to push the boundaries of imagination within vr.
cwirc is a plugin designed for the x-chat irc client, allowing users to transmit raw morse code over the internet through irc servers acting as reflectors.
this transmission can be almost instantly received by other x-chat clients equipped with the cwirc plugin.
the function of cwirc aims to simulate a traditional amateur radio setup by transmitting and receiving morse code via virtual channels, enabling the listening to multiple transmissions on the same channel.
to input morse code, the user can use either a straight or iambic key connected to a serial port, or through mouse buttons.
the audio output is facilitated either through the soundcard or an external sounder.
it is important to note that cwirc does not perform morse code decoding; it solely handles the timing events of transmitting and receiving morse code.
therefore, when morse code is transmitted, non-cwirc irc users on the same channel will only see encrypted lines, while the morse can be received by other cwirc users.

special thanks to knighty and kevinsano for their helpful advice on improving the font's kerning.
on d-day, a vast number of landing craft were utilized to ferry troops and equipment across the english channel.
the assortment included a variety of craft, ranging from small assault landing craft to large landing ships, some equipped with weaponry like guns or rockets.
notably, a 'landing barge, kitchen' was even present to cater to the culinary needs of the soldiers.
this strategic use of landing craft allowed the allies to land personnel and heavy machinery, such as tanks, on heavily fortified beaches that were initially not designated as supply points.
by facilitating the direct transportation of equipment to the shore, these vessels provided an interim solution to the challenge of securing essential harbors and ports vital for the rapid accumulation of resources and personnel.
while the concept of specialized landing craft emerged early in the conflict, it was not until d-day that they were deployed on such a massive scale.
upon receiving images of an ice imprint from the front of a jeep, we were astounded.
the ice sculpture was found in the visitor's parking lot at vidant medical center tuesday afternoon.
witn was sent two distinct photos from employees at vidant: one capturing the front view and the other showing a different perspective.
according to terry costakis, it is suspected that the jeep's owner allowed the vehicle to warm up with the engine running, resulting in the imprint when backing out of the parking spot, with the ice adhered to the curb.
kimberly freeman, who snapped the frontal picture, initially mistook it for a mirage.
though the duration of its stay is unknown, the phenomenon was undeniably fascinating.

sap announced on tuesday the introduction of its flagship business suite applications as a cloud-based subscription service as part of its strategy to shift on-premise customers to the cloud.
the move aims to keep up with rival oracle, who also offers applications via subscription, while competing with cloud providers like netsuite, salesforce, and workday.
however, the availability of business suite in the cloud is a significant development for sap users.
specific pricing details were not provided on sap's website, and the company was not available for immediate comment.
it is evident that transitioning from on-premise to sap's cloud suite will be a gradual process, as companies are unlikely to quickly replace their core financial systems until they have fully depreciated them.
during this transitional period, companies moving to the cloud will explore various options beyond sap's business suite.
sap is primarily aiming to counter rival cloud offerings and provide customers with a compelling reason to remain loyal to the company.
the company also believes that the suite model will prevail, even in the cloud environment.
these recent developments are aligned with sap's strategic discussions held in new york in march.
the cloud-based business suite subscription is officially known as sap business suite via the sap hana enterprise cloud.
additionally, sap has expanded its global data center presence and migration services to facilitate seamless integration of its cloud products, such as successfactors and ariba, with on-premise deployments.
with a total of 16 data centers worldwide, including newly established facilities in tokyo and osaka by sap japan, the focus is on an "in-memory-centric" infrastructure.
notable companies like mclaren, schaidt innovations, and levi strauss have already begun migrating to business suite via on-demand or hybrid models.
sap underscores that customers will benefit from faster access to innovative solutions in a cloud-based model, with the flexibility to choose deployment options that best suit their needs.
the red and black bloc (rbb) creates an electrifying atmosphere at a-league matches with their fervent chanting and singing.
many view the group as a symbol of success as it has brought together individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds in sydney's western suburbs to support the wanderers.
despite their passion, the rbb has faced criticism for incidents involving some of its members, often highlighted in the media due to clashes with law enforcement.
for instance, during a match on anzac day against perth, rbb fans left pirtek stadium in protest at halftime following alleged pepper spray usage by the police in response to a flare being ignited.
reports indicated that police officers were harmed during the ensuing scuffle, which spilled outside the stadium.
while most rbb supporters are commended for their good behavior and enthusiasm, there is concern about a faction within the group that may incite trouble, prompting law enforcement to closely monitor potential issues.
authorities have been vigilant about preventing the emergence of violent "firms" reminiscent of old english football hooligans among supporters, ensuring those prone to disruptive behavior are identified and dealt with accordingly.
the aam aadmi party's assertion that corruption decreased during its 49-day stint in power in the capital may be substantiated by a recent survey.
according to the findings, 50% of the residents of delhi believe that the measures implemented by the aap government were instrumental in reducing bribery incidents.
a survey conducted about six weeks after the arvind kejriwal-led administration stepped down revealed that nearly 64% of the respondents noticed a significant shift in the behavior of officials, with many expressing reluctance when it came to soliciting bribes.
the study, titled 'retail bribery in delhi', involved 1,500 participants from diverse backgrounds such as unskilled laborers, street vendors, as well as auto-rickshaw and truck drivers, who frequently encounter bribery situations.
anupama jha, the report's author, mentioned that the survey was initiated and completed within 10 days in february.
it was noted that close to 70% of the respondents admitted to paying bribes for job continuity.
interestingly, the survey identified the police, mcd, dda, and rto as the most corrupt government entities.
jha, who conducted the survey on behalf of the ngo 'initiatives for transparency and accountability' post her exit from transparency international, highlighted that people perceived a shift in the behavior of public officials under kejriwal's leadership, noting a decreased tendency to demand bribes.
leonys martin is scheduled for surgery on his right hand this wednesday to remove the hamate bone, as reported by the beat reporters on twitter.
they have mentioned that martin is expected to resume running and playing defense in approximately two weeks, with a possibility of returning to hitting in four to six weeks.
while ideally, martin would be able to return to playing immediately, this plan allows the rangers to bring him back up when rosters expand.
he could be utilized as a pinch runner or defensive replacement late in games, even if he is not yet able to hit effectively.
once martin regains the ability to swing the bat, the minor league season will have concluded, preventing him from going on a rehab assignment.
the hope is for martin to recover in time to contribute offensively before the season ends, making him a valuable option to support delino deshields in center field during games.
having devoured all 11 books in craven's series and delving into additional ones like rebel radio and good fences, i found myself captivated by his storytelling.
amidst a sea of apocalyptic books filled with graphic violence and destruction, craven's approach stood out for its balance and depth.

through vivid descriptions, i was able to join the characters on their journey, witnessing their growth and feeling deeply connected to their fates.
the theme of resilience in the face of adversity resonated strongly, as did the portrayal of humanity's darker tendencies when societal norms disintegrate.
i particularly appreciated the inclusion of military strategy, exemplified by characters like king and michael, as well as the dynamic setting of blake's farm and rebel radio, which served as a focal point for diverse storylines.
the series left me longing for more, a testament to craven's skill in crafting a rich and engaging narrative.

in the town of faenza, turtle doves were found scattered across streets, flower beds, and hanging from trees in a manner likened to christmas decorations.
many of the deceased birds exhibited a puzzling blue stain in their beaks.
while the causes behind these incidents remain largely unknown, officials speculate that fireworks may have played a role in the bird fatalities, whereas abnormally cold weather could be connected to the unusual mass deaths of fish and crabs.

to investigate further, samples of the deceased birds have been sent for testing by both the local forest service and wwf in faenza, with results expected to be disclosed in about a week.

the recent assassination of kandahar's mayor, ghulam haidar hamidi, adds to a series of targeted killings occurring across the country, particularly impacting high-ranking officials in the region.
the governor's office reports that within the last year, two deputy mayors of kandahar city were fatally shot by militants, and the kandahar police chief khan mohammad mujahid fell victim to a suicide bomber in april.
another significant incident involved the assassination of kandahar's provincial council chief, ahmed wali karzai, the influential half-brother of the president, who was killed by his long-standing bodyguard at home.

in an upcoming interview with fox news' tucker carlson, trump mentioned, "wiretap covers a lot of different things.
i think you're going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks." despite bipartisan calls for evidence disputing the claim, the white house has remained steadfast in alleging that trump tower was under surveillance before the election.
while some of trump's supporters have urged an inquiry into these allegations, white house press secretary sean spicer clarified earlier this week that trump's reference was to "surveillance" on his manhattan building, a term broader than wiretapping.
in-form bury secured a 2-1 home victory against chesterfield in league one with a late winner from tom pope.
the hosts took the lead in the 41st minute when zeli ismail volleyed in a goal, quickly canceled out by kristian dennis.
in an evenly contested second half, pope scored the decisive goal with a header three minutes from time, marking bury's fifth consecutive win and propelling them to second place in the league.
the match saw a promising start from bury, with chesterfield's debutant liam graham blocking ismail's shot before the latter missed a chance created by jacob mellis.
despite dennis's failed attempt to connect with a cross from jay o'shea and an impressive save from chesterfield's goalkeeper ryan fulton which denied ismail, the game remained tightly contested.

dennis managed to equalize shortly after, but bury ultimately claimed victory as tom walker's delivery from the left found pope, who expertly steered in his fifth goal of the season.
do you remember the era when yahoo was the primary search engine for many internet users?
interestingly, it might be reclaiming that position soon, particularly for firefox users.
mozilla and yahoo have recently unveiled a lengthy five-year agreement to designate yahoo as the default search engine for the web browser, replacing google as the foremost choice in firefox's search bar within the united states.
the motive behind this change, according to mozilla, is to enhance the user experience by offering a more "local" touch.
previously, mozilla had universally utilized google search irrespective of the user's location.
however, moving forward, the default search engine will be customized based on the user's region: yahoo for the united states, yandex search for russia, and baidu for china.
furthermore, users in each region will have the flexibility to switch to other local search options, thus enabling former google users to revert back if they prefer.

the tech giant has confirmed its acquisition of altspacevr, marking a pivotal moment for windows mixed reality by incorporating a dedicated social vr solution.
alex kipman, who heads microsoft's mixed reality division, expressed optimism in shaping the leading mixed reality community with the addition of the altspacevr team.

a un panel has reported that japanese authorities may have underestimated by 20 percent the radiation doses received by workers during the early stages of the fukushima nuclear disaster.
following a powerful earthquake and tsunami in march 2011 that caused three reactor meltdowns at the power station located 150 miles north of tokyo, the operator tepco has faced challenges in controlling the release of radioactive substances.
the un scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation has cast doubts on the accuracy of government and tepco's dose estimations.
as per the asahi shimbun newspaper, the un committee reviewed radiation exposure in 25,000 workers who were at the site on or before october 2012.
it was found that the testing methods used did not consider certain types of radiation, specifically iodine-132 and iodine-133, due to the delayed implementation of tests for thyroid gland doses from radioactive iodine.
if the un panel's assessment holds true, it could mean more workers would qualify for complimentary health screenings, although the potential health impacts were not specified.
the connection between increased radiation exposure and higher risks of cancer and thyroid issues underscores the importance of accurate dose assessments for safeguarding worker health.
as per the associated press, syria is reportedly placing landmines along its border with lebanon as an increasing number of syrian refugees seek to flee the government's harsh crackdown on protesters.
over 5,000 syrians have sought refuge in lebanon since the uprisings began in march, with this surge in refugees to lebanon and turkey causing discomfort for syrian president bashar al-assad.
the planting of landmines serves as a stark indicator of syria's efforts to prevent lebanon from becoming a safe haven for syrian opposition forces, reflecting syria's growing isolation in the region since the onset of the anti-assad demonstrations eight months ago.
despite claims by a syrian official that the landmines are aimed at thwarting arms smuggling into syria, this move has stirred further tensions in the region.
moreover, the situation is compounded by syria's complex border interactions with neighboring countries characterized by shared religious and ethnic minorities.
with turkey, once an ally, now opening its borders to anti-assad rebels and activists, ties in the region are clearly undergoing significant shifts.
keith hernandez, the esteemed sny new york mets analyst, is currently a free agent.
however, talks for his contract renewal with the mets-centered regional sports network are expected to commence soon now that the holiday season has passed.
hernandez, who is 62 years old, has been an integral part of the mets telecasts on sny for a decade.
alongside play-by-play announcer gary cohen and co-analyst ron darling, they constitute a highly cherished broadcast trio within the sports sphere.
while the sny booth for mets games has remained consistent since the network's inception ten years ago, recent changes have occurred in the network's on-air talent.
last winter, studio analyst bobby ojeda's contract negotiation challenges led to his replacement by former mets pitcher nelson figueroa.
additionally, field reporter kevin burkhardt's departure for a prominent role with fox post-2014 season resulted in steve gelbs assuming his position.
before the atletico madrid versus real betis match on sunday, falcao had missed three games due to a hamstring injury.
as he geared up for his return, he aimed to ensure everything was perfect, even the music playing at the vicente calderon's pa system during the warm-up.
dissatisfied with the initial song choice, falcao signaled to atletico's staff to convey his displeasure.
after some discreet communication, the track "gangnam style" played in the stadium, much to falcao's approval.
despite concerns that he might be the only one still enjoying it, the team secured a 1-0 victory, with falcao participating for 80 minutes.
reports from bbc news, jakarta reveal a troubling incident in indonesia where a muslim cleric, pujianto cahyo widianto, stirred public outrage by marrying a 12-year-old girl in an unofficial religious ceremony held in semarang, central java.
the cleric purportedly selected the girl from a group of 20 candidates before taking her to singapore alongside his first wife.
authorities have initiated an inquiry into the matter, examining potential legal charges.
initial findings by indonesia's child protection agency suggest that widianto assessed the girl's suitability for marriage based on her intelligence, maturity, and physical attributes, intending to involve her in managing his calligraphy workshop.
although it remains uncertain whether the marriage has been consummated, any such act could subject widianto to prosecution under child protection, marriage, and labor regulations.
widianto has defended his actions by citing emulation of prophet muhammad and asserting that he will await the girl's puberty before engaging in sexual relations.
opposition to the marriage has surfaced within indonesia, with a senior member of the islamic party pks condemning widianto's conduct as fundamentally flawed both morally and religiously.
while indonesian authorities are actively investigating the situation, extradition requests to singapore have not been made thus far.

in the massachusetts senate race, democrat elizabeth warren and republican sen.
scott brown are currently tied according to a recent poll released on tuesday by the massachusetts think tank massinc for the boston npr station wbur.
the poll indicates that 46 percent of likely voters in the state would support warren, while 43 percent would back brown, falling within the margin of error.
this poll, the first conducted since early december, suggests a closely contested race between the two candidates.
both warren and brown are relatively popular in the state, although warren may have less recognition among voters due to a higher percentage being undecided or unfamiliar with her.
brown holds a 53 percent to 32 percent lead over warren among independent or unaffiliated voters, who generally hold a more favorable view of brown compared to warren.
in the same poll, voters favored president barack obama over mitt romney 55 to 34 percent, and over newt gingrich 66 to 19 percent in the presidential race.
on sunday, fans anticipating last-minute seats at the western bulldogs versus essendon match at etihad stadium were met with disappointment as only standing room tickets were left for purchase by the general public and select club members.
even bulldogs members holding general admission memberships found themselves unable to secure a dedicated seat for the game on the morning of the event, as only standing room areas or pricier premium seats were offered as alternatives.
consequently, those hopeful for a general admission spot were unfortunately being turned down.
despite the situation, bulldogs general admission members could still scan into etihad stadium before the game commenced, albeit with standing room being the sole available option.
some members, particularly those with young children, opted to view the match from the large screen located above gate three, while others decided to head back home due to their children being too small to have a clear view from the standing areas.
bruce miller, a rookie for the 49ers and a 7th round draft pick, made a comeback after being activated from the physically unable to perform list and joined practice today in pads, as confirmed by matt maiocco.
standing at 6'2 and weighing 255 pounds, miller, a former defensive end from ucf, was informed by the 49ers that he would transition to a fullback role for this season.
despite his background as a tight end in high school, the 49ers scouted him as a potential fullback before the draft, ultimately leading to his selection in the 7th round.
miller is now aiming for the starting fullback position held by moran norris, but he will have to compete with new signing jack corcoran from the titans' practice squad.
additionally, undrafted rookie konrad reuland and former 49ers practice squad tight end colin cloherty will also be vying for the h-back role, likely seeing playing time at fullback as well.
miller must prove his recovery from a shoulder injury to secure a spot on the roster amidst the competition.
a recent report in the mirror has painted a positive picture for arsenal on the injury front.
the article suggests that mikel arteta and lukas podolski may be making their return to the team earlier than initially anticipated.
arteta sustained a thigh injury before the season commenced, with a projected return date of around october.
however, recent developments indicate that he might be fit to play as soon as next week when arsenal takes on west bromwich albion in the capital one cup.
podolski, who suffered a hamstring injury during a match against fenerbahce in the champions league qualifier, was also expected to be out until late october or november, but now there are signs pointing towards a potential comeback by the end of september.
this positive update comes amidst the recent news shared by arsene wenger that santi cazorla will be sidelined until early next month.
the swift returns of arteta and podolski will be especially beneficial considering arsenal's packed upcoming fixture list, reflecting the team's ambitions across different competitions.
the timely recoveries of these key players could provide a much-needed boost for the squad in the forthcoming weeks.
in a commanding victory, roma dominated rock-bottom pescara with a 4-1 win, bringing them within eight points of serie a leaders juventus.
the defeat also sealed pescara's fate, relegating them officially.
the match saw roma swiftly take control with three goals in a five-minute span, with kevin strootman opening the scoring just before halftime followed by radja nainggolan's goal right before the break.
mohamed salah extended the lead early in the second half with a precise shot, and then later added another goal at the hour mark.
despite missed opportunities to increase their lead, roma sealed a convincing win.
pescara managed a consolation goal when ahmed benali scored from ledian memushaj's cross late in the game.
this loss condemned pescara back to serie b, unable to escape the depths of the league after a difficult season, with their numerous defeats preventing them from catching up with empoli, who secured their survival.
five individuals have been hospitalized after consuming nacho cheese from a gas station in sacramento, as stated by california officials.
the reported incidents of botulism have been linked to valley oak food and fuel gas station in the walnut grove suburb, according to the sacramento bee.
the suspected cause of the illnesses is believed to be the nacho cheese, although investigations are still ongoing.
sacramento health authorities are investigating four additional potential cases related to the outbreak.
botulism is a rare form of food poisoning that can result in paralysis, breathing complications, and in severe cases, death.
following the incident, a legal action has been taken by one of the affected individuals against the gas station.
lavinia kelly, who has been hospitalized for three weeks and is currently unable to speak or keep her eyes open, has been specifically mentioned.
the gas station has had its food and drink selling license revoked by officials, and attempts to reach out to its employees for comments have so far been unsuccessful.
despite the eagerness of fans for a star wars tv series, particularly with the previously considered star wars underworld project, there doesn't seem to be any current active development in that direction.
abc president paul lee mentioned in an interview with tvline that the focus is currently on star wars movies, with no immediate plans for a tv series.
in the meantime, the emphasis is on the star wars rebels animated series, which is currently in its second season and has already been approved for a third.
this show, set between the timelines of the original and prequel trilogies, incorporates both new and familiar characters, with recent appearances by iconic figures such as princess leia.
while lee was specifically addressing abc's stance, rumors persist about the potential collaboration between netflix and disney for a live-action star wars series, following the successful partnership between netflix and marvel.
given lucasfilm's flexible approach, elements from the shelved star wars underworld project may resurface in other initiatives, as seen with assets originally conceived for lucasarts games being repurposed for the clone wars series.
georgia lawmakers discussed a bill on thursday that could broaden the eligibility for individuals with mental health issues to obtain licenses to carry guns.
the proposed legislation would permit those who have undergone voluntary inpatient treatment for mental illness or substance abuse to apply for such licenses.
additionally, the bill aims to streamline the process for authorities to verify if applicants have a history of involuntary treatment.
furthermore, georgia is considering allowing firearms in churches, bars, and on college campuses.
presently, judicial discretion is exercised in deciding whether to grant a carry license to individuals who have received inpatient mental health or substance abuse treatment in the preceding five years.
iraq has recently experienced a series of deadly attacks, with at least 11 incidents resulting in multiple casualties.
among the attacks, the deadliest took place near baghdad, where 11 soldiers were killed in a shooting and bombing assault on an army base.
furthermore, two car bombings near the city of amara claimed the lives of at least 14 individuals and left more than 60 wounded, as reported by local authorities.
sunni insurgents affiliated with al-qaeda have been identified as the perpetrators behind much of the recent violence in the country.
additionally, an attack on an army base in the balad district involved armed insurgents who also set off improvised explosive devices at the site.
in a separate incident near kirkuk, seven police officers were killed by a bomb while applying for jobs with the northern oil company.
the escalating violence, which includes attacks in various locations across iraq causing at least 45 fatalities and numerous injuries, underscores the ongoing sectarian tensions in the region.
among the attacks, a bomb detonated near the french consulate in nasiriya, resulting in two casualties.
notably, the recent surge in violence follows a previous attack on shia muslim places of worship in kirkuk, and the sentencing of vice-president tariq al-hashemi to death in absentia for running death squads.
hashemi, a prominent sunni politician, fled iraq in december to avoid arrest by the shia-dominated government.
the resurgence in attacks after the departure of us troops last year reveals the fragile security situation in iraq amid mounting political and sectarian divisions.
a left-wing ngo's bus was targeted in a rock-throwing incident near hebron in the west bank on friday, resulting in minor injuries to three individuals.
the perpetrators of the attack, which took place in south mount hebron, were identified as palestinian children, according to information provided by breaking the silence to haaretz.
the three injured individuals were part of a breaking the silence tour when the assault occurred.
breaking the silence, established by former israel defense force veterans, focuses on revealing allegations of military misconduct in the palestinian territories.
through conducting tours across the west bank, the organization aims to shed light on their challenging idf experiences, particularly in areas where human rights violations reportedly persist.
following the incident, a breaking the silence spokesperson acknowledged that fortunately, no one sustained severe injuries, emphasizing the harsh reality in the territories and the organization's efforts to instigate change.
however, breaking the silence faced criticism recently when a right-wing ngo labeled them as 'moles' in a video and accused them of treason.
as a result, several israeli ministers publicly criticized the group, with education minister naftali bennett going as far as banning breaking the silence from participating in school activities.
a 40-year-old man in montgomery county was killed in a shooting incident after allegedly threatening a homeowner with an ax.
the montgomery county sheriffs deputies responded to a call around 11:30 pm at a residence in the 16000 block of suzanne in northeast montgomery county.
upon arriving, they discovered that the victim had been shot in the chest by the homeowner.
the victim was then rushed by ambulance to a local conroe hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.
the victim's identity has not been disclosed.
according to detectives, the altercation between the homeowner and the victim began at a nearby house, escalated when the victim drove his vehicle through a neighboring yard, and made threats to the family.
subsequently, he brandished an ax to confront the homeowner, who then defended himself with a gun, resulting in the fatal shooting.
currently, no charges have been brought against the homeowner.
after three unsuccessful days attempting to thru-hike the arizona trail, i made the decision to temporarily leave the trail and regroup.
spending two days with my aunt at patagonia lake state park allowed me the opportunity to reassess my gear and discard any unnecessary items, while also taking time to do laundry and stay in touch with my hiking partner in the hope of returning to the trail soon.
one afternoon, my aunt and i visited the marina to inquire about renting kayaks for a leisurely tour of the lake, but strong winds prompted a kind marina operator to instead offer us a pontoon boat ride to explore the serene lake.
the primitive campsites tucked away along the shores, accessible only by boat, showcased the park's beautiful scenery.
despite my initial disappointment at halting my thru-hike so soon, the serene days spent at patagonia lake with my aunt proved to be a meaningful experience that i cherish.
the lucas museum, situated by chicago's lakefront, overcame its final major obstacle as the city council granted full approval for the museum's plans in a vote on wednesday.
the renowned filmmaker behind "star wars" intends to construct the lucas museum of narrative art, a 300,000-square-foot facility near soldier field along lake michigan.
a deal was authorized by the chicago park district earlier in the month to lease seven acres of land near the stadium for the museum project.
following this, a city zoning committee also recommended the approval of the museum plan.
despite these approvals, the museum is now facing a challenge from the non-profit organization friends of the park, which has filed a lawsuit opposing the museum's construction on public lakefront property, claiming it could detract from the shoreline's character.
however, the museum's proponents have proposed plans to create and sustain thousands of square feet of new green space along the lakefront, ensuring that the construction and maintenance costs will not burden chicago taxpayers.
concurrently, the chicago bears and the chicago park district have reached an agreement regarding game-day parking, involving the relocation of tailgating spots to new areas on the museum campus in grant park, such as the "event prairie" tailgating lawn and atop a new parking garage on 18th street.
construction on the museum is set to commence no earlier than march 1, with a potential opening scheduled for 2019, according to the associated press.
wolves secured a much-needed victory against midlands rivals birmingham at molineux, finally ending a streak of six winless home games.
the triumph, fueled by a marlon king own goal off a bakary sako free-kick in the 34th minute, not only broke the dry spell but also relieved some pressure off wolves manager stale solbakken.
despite birmingham's promising start, king's accidental redirection of sako's free-kick into his own net proved decisive as his team couldn't recover.
wolves dominated the second half, creating numerous chances but failing to find a second goal, ultimately maintaining their lead for the win.
this victory, following their previous win against bristol city, marked only the second time this season that wolves secured back-to-back wins.
in contrast, birmingham continued to struggle, with king's own goal adding to their woes.
noteworthy was the performance of birmingham's goalkeeper, jack butland, who made impressive saves, including denying stephen ward and bjorn sigurdarson.
despite butland's efforts, birmingham couldn't find an equalizer, as they fell victim to wolves' resilient display.
driven by the success of the decimation of enemy structures, the ancients have possessed the ability to upgrade their creeps into more formidable warriors, enabling them to penetrate deeper into rival fortifications.
a recent development now sees a new level of transformation underway.

additionally, for those who invested in this year's compendium for the international, an innovative feature called heroic effigies has been introduced for showcasing heroic acts.
this new customization option enables players to fashion a statue of their preferred hero, complete with equipped items, that is prominently displayed in their team's base.
to fashion an effigy, players must acquire the effigy block of triumph, then utilize it to access the sculptor menu and commence creating their hero statue.
once the equipment, pose, and inscription are finalized, the effigy can be crafted.
equipping the heroic effigy from the loadout will showcase it at the team's base, serving as a symbol of valor for all to admire.
australian mining companies operating in africa have been associated with numerous fatalities and injuries, many of which may not be reported domestically.
several australian securities exchange-listed companies have state governments among their shareholders.
in one instance, a company documented 38 worker deaths on record over an eleven-year span.
in malawi, legal actions are underway against paladin africa limited, a subsidiary of paladin energy based in perth, and its subcontractor following an explosion that severely disfigured a worker, causing his skin to shatter upon touch by rescuers, resulting in two fatalities.
there have been additional accusations, including an incident in south africa where an employee allegedly assaulted a woman with a machete and in mali where two protesters were killed by police after a mine worker requested authorities to clear a roadblock leading to the mine.
an investigation conducted by the international consortium of investigative journalists, in partnership with 13 african journalists, revealed lawsuits filed locally, violent demonstrations, and community petitions condemning certain australian firms.
a total of over 380 individuals, comprising employees, subcontractors, and community members across 13 countries, have succumbed to accidents or events related to these companies since 2004, with some being fatally shot.
others suffered severe disfigurations or injuries while working at australian mines or during protests against them.
trade minister andrew robb has revealed that a significant regional trade agreement supporting barack obama's "pivot" to asia may soon be finalized.
despite this optimism, a key obstacle remains: the lack of rapid approval from the us congress due to democratic senator elizabeth warren's maneuvers to win over left-leaning voters from hillary clinton in the upcoming presidential contest.
the us-led trans-pacific partnership, spanning 12 nations and representing 40% of the global economy, is anticipated to reinforce an open, rule-based economic framework in the asia pacific area, as outlined by experts in washington and canberra.
robb suggest that negotiators are on the brink of reaching a groundbreaking agreement that promises substantial economic gains for australia and a significant strategic victory for the united states in its competition with china for regional dominance.
david nofoaluma and jared waerea-hargreaves are facing potential one-match bans following citations by the nrl match review committee on sunday.
waerea-hargreaves received a grade 1 dangerous contact charge for his action against wests tigers' tui lolohea, while nofoaluma was also charged with a grade 1 dangerous contact for his tackle on ryan matterson.
however, both players have the option to avoid suspension by submitting early guilty pleas.
on the other hand, wade graham and james maloney from the sharks have been charged as well, but they are set to receive monetary fines rather than a suspension.
graham's charge stems from a careless high tackle on michael morgan, whereas maloney was charged for tripping ethan lowe.
based on my sociological expertise, i have observed that gender sociology often isolates itself from challenges to its entrenched beliefs and causes.
these established beliefs revolve around the idea that the biological disparities between sexes are insignificant and that cultural divergences among genders are not rooted in biological dissimilarities.
despite this, various scholarly disciplines such as anthropology, developmental psychology, evolutionary psychology, neurosciences, genetics, and biology have presented research findings that counter these fundamental beliefs.
over the years, a substantial body of research has demonstrated differences in traits like competitiveness, aggression, sexual interest, risk behavior, brain physiology, and neuroimaging using diverse methodologies.
to validate my observations, i scrutinized a selection of highly cited gender sociology papers and confirmed a strong tendency towards insularity within this field.
it is disheartening to witness students and researchers align themselves with closed communities that uphold questionable beliefs and causes.
i recommend that gender sociologists make a concerted effort to break free from this insularity and embrace more inclusive and diverse perspectives.
sarah pirie, a 27-year-old ballet teacher and choreographer known for her work in stage shows and tv soaps such as hollyoaks and waterloo road, allegedly engaged in a three-month affair with a 15-year-old male pupil.
pirie, originally from scotland and formerly based in st annes, lancashire, is accused of taking the boy to hotels where she reportedly had sexual relations with him.
she appeared before magistrates in blackpool where she faced five charges of intentionally sexually touching the underage boy, who is training to become a ballet dancer.
due to legal reasons, the boy's identity is protected.
pirie, the daughter of a banker, who previously taught at a dance school on the fylde coast, allegedly took the teenager to hotels in manchester for illicit activities.
the incidents are said to have occurred between march and june the previous year, with one charge also involving the alleged abduction of the boy from blackpool in may.
although pirie, currently residing in mamer, luxembourg, only confirmed her name and address during the brief hearing, her lawyer indicated that she would plead not guilty to all charges.
following a request from the prosecutor, the case is scheduled to be heard at the crown court.
pirie was granted bail until april 30, when her case will be transferred to the higher court.
coming from a background in dance education at the hammond school in chester, pirie, originally from leuchars near dundee, has built a career as a dancer and choreographer, starring in and choreographing various musicals and pantomimes around the uk.
recent records from britain's national archives have unveiled historical documents revealing the former prime minister winston churchill's efforts to conceal a collaboration scheme between the nazis and certain members of the british royal family.
the covert strategy aimed at placing the duke of windsor as the monarch in the event of a successful nazi invasion of britain, involved enticing the abdicated king from neutral portugal to spain under certain terms.
classified memos disclosed on thursday outlined churchill's endeavors to defer disclosure of the conspiracy post-world war ii due to concerns regarding the public perception of the royal family.
notably, churchill also sought assistance from president dwight eisenhower in 1953 to withhold the publication of the memos.
fortunately, the nazi plot was thwarted, and the memos were eventually released in 1957, subsequent to churchill's tenure as prime minister.

beneath the streets of gowanus lies a secret recording studio, accessible via a staircase that descends to murky waters disconnected from the superfund site, forming a part of the subterranean pond beneath the neighborhood.
established in 1979, this studio has hosted iconic bands such as sonic youth, dresden dolls, afrika bambaata, and fab five freddy, making it a legendary space in the music industry.
recently, we had the opportunity to visit this unique studio as owner and producer martin bisi gears up for a documentary showcasing its history.
maintaining its vintage charm, the studio is furnished with elements like the classic, albeit worn-out, couch that is a staple in any reputable recording space.
martin, still at the helm of bc studios, established the facility with bill laswell and brian eno during a time when "wild packs of dogs" freely roamed the area.
for those intrigued by this groundbreaking studio's rich history, the premiere of "sound and chaos: the story of bc studio" will take place tomorrow night at anthology film archives.
two years back during halloween, i had a custom mask made for a costume.
although it was entertaining, it hindered my interactions at halloween gatherings.
last year, i aimed for a costume idea that wouldn't necessitate any special attire, leading me to the concept of embodying a ventriloquist dummy.
with no prior ventriloquism skills, i believed it would be simpler to animate the dummy than to learn throwing my voice.
opting not to start from scratch, i decided to employ the mechanics of an existing toy to bring my dummy to life efficiently.
i detail below my process and approach.
without keeping track of time precisely, it consumed approximately three weeks of sporadic hours, involving numerous trials and errors.
in the end, i did not have to rewire anything since the toy's internal components enabled additional movements that the dummy could accommodate if required.
elephants are known for their profound capacity to mourn and bury their deceased companions.
in capturing moments of grief, there are instances of elephants visibly shedding tears while performing the somber task of laying their departed to rest.
it can be a lengthy process, sometimes lasting up to 3 days, before an elephant can find the resolve to part from the side of a loved one who has passed away.
particularly poignant is the enduring bond of a mother elephant with her offspring; even years after a loss, she might revisit the burial site to grieve anew.
a notable example of this emotional intelligence was witnessed upon the passing of lawrence anthony, renowned as "the elephant whisperer," who had established a close relationship with these majestic creatures.
elephants congregated at his home soon after his death, mourning his loss for a day and a half.
it remains a mystery how they sensed his departure, yet two herds, absent for more than a year, made a poignant return to commemorate his life.
these tender displays of sorrow and devotion exhibited by elephants challenge our perception of love and compassion, affirming that their lives are imbued with a deeper purpose beyond mere survival.
the diverse defense mechanisms observed in animals and plants have been influenced by consumer selections.
these defenses can range from physical structures to behaviors and chemical signals that play a crucial role in predator-prey interactions.
among the peculiar defensive adaptations found in nature are the globiferous pedicellariae of echinoderms, which are tiny venomous appendages equipped with jaws and teeth covering the bodies of various sea urchins and sea stars.
this research highlights a novel utilization of these defensive structures by the collector sea urchin tripneustes gratilla.
both in controlled laboratory settings and natural environments, it was observed that the globiferous pedicellariae were unappealing to predatory fish.
when threatened by simulated predators, sea urchins released a cloud of pedicellariae heads into the water, emitting a deterrence cue for potential predators.
flume experiments confirmed the existence of a waterborne signal associated with the discharge of pedicellariae, which serves as a deterrent to predatory fish.
these groundbreaking findings contribute to our comprehension of how the ecosystem-shaping sea urchin t.
gratilla maintains high population densities in various reef habitats, consequently impacting algal cover.
president obama acknowledged the need to enhance social security, though he did not provide specific details during his remaining term in office.
suggestions mentioned by his team align with proposals from democratic figures like sanders and hillary clinton.
sanders recommends a universal benefit boost and increased minimum benefits for those with low incomes, while clinton suggests elevating survivor benefits and introducing a caregiver credit to support women who have dedicated their careers to caring for family members.
both also propose lifting the payroll tax cap to bolster the program's financial stability.

i encountered an unusual situation with my secret santa exchange.
initially, my assigned santa didn't reach out to me before the deadline due to personal reasons, so i was automatically reassigned to a rematcher.
unfortunately, i only realized this after my original santa had already sent me a gift, leaving me unable to inform the rematcher about the situation.
eventually, the rematcher contacted me last week, and i explained the scenario, assuring her that she didn't have to send another gift since i had already received a lovely one.
however, she was insistent, and yesterday, i was pleasantly surprised to receive a heartfelt letter and a thoughtful gift.
as a mother of young children, she cleverly included 2 sets of blank watercolor cards and 2 watercolor sets for the twins to create cards for their loved ones.
additionally, she included a variety of colorful pens just for me.
i appreciate her considerate gesture and look forward to seeing the kids' artwork.

the weather in recent days has been absolutely fantastic!
despite some individuals venturing south from toronto in pursuit of warm temperatures, they have found ontario to be surprisingly warm, even breaking records.
this march break has been an ideal time for kids to enjoy spending countless hours outdoors, whether in the backyard, park, or zoo.
they have been relishing their time playing soccer, lounging on the deck, tending to the yard, and, of course, grilling!
warm weather naturally calls for grilling while relaxing on the deck with a refreshing drink in hand.
while grilling typically emphasizes meat, these vegetable skewers serve as a delightful complement.
grilling vegetables imparts a delectable caramelized taste while maintaining their fresh summery essence.
furthermore, the post-grilling balsamic vinaigrette application provides a tangy and flavorful kick that beautifully elevates the vegetables.
i recommend brushing on the vinaigrette after grilling to prevent flare-ups that might char the skewers.
for those preparing these skewers, ensure you make an ample amount, as they are bound to vanish quickly!
feel free to experiment with other vegetables such as cherry tomatoes, yellow squash, zucchini, and more.
five political activists in the united arab emirates were recently granted a pardon, a day following their conviction for disrespecting the leaders of the gulf state.
the activists' lawyer, mohammed al-roken, informed the associated press that the pardon by president khalifa bin zayed al nahyan had been confirmed by the public prosecution.
the group, among them a well-known blogger and an economist, had been sentenced to prison terms of up to three years on sunday, sparking outcry from human rights organizations.
their arrest in april came after they signed an online petition urging the uae rulers to implement direct elections and grant the parliament legislative authority.
the existing 40-member parliament functions solely as an advisory panel, with members being appointed directly by the ruling sheikhs or selected citizens designated by the rulers for voting.
the charges against the activists included insulting the leadership and jeopardizing national security.
the trial was heavily criticized by rights advocates for its lack of fairness, leading the defendants to a two-week hunger strike in protest.
on sunday, blogger ahmed mansour was handed a three-year jail term by the state security court in abu dhabi.

while the importance of water for human homeostasis and survival is widely acknowledged, its specific impact on brain function has only recently come into focus.
in this article, we aim to synthesize new evidence on the effects of dehydration and acute water consumption on cognition and mood.
recent research indicates that water intake can enhance certain cognitive functions and mood states positively.
these effects are particularly significant for individuals with compromised fluid regulation, such as the elderly and children.
by analyzing the latest behavioral and neuroimaging studies on dehydration, we aim to connect these findings with the known physiological effects of water on hormonal, neurochemical, and vascular functions, proposing potential underlying mechanisms.
we also critique the field's current limitations, including inconsistent cognitive assessment methods, lack of precise hydration measurements, and gaps in understanding how various factors may influence water's effects.
looking ahead, we suggest avenues for future research to delve deeper into water's role in optimizing brain health and function.
the scarcity of freshwater is an increasingly pressing issue globally, projected to worsen in the coming decades due to rising food demand and the impacts of climate change.
to address this challenge, sustainable and energy-efficient desalination technologies are essential for harnessing the abundant water resources found in oceans.
one promising approach involves utilizing sunlight-powered desalination techniques driven by photosynthetic organisms, such as cyanobacteria.
these organisms can thrive in brackish and seawater, producing biomass that creates a low-salt environment within saline water.
by manipulating transport proteins in cell membranes, this low-salt reservoir could serve as an ion exchanger.
this article explores the potential of biodesalination through cyanobacteria and examines tools and strategies available for leveraging these organisms in water biotechnology.
key topics covered include strain selection, environmental considerations, genetic engineering, ion transportation, cell-water separation, process optimization, safety protocols, and societal acceptance.
